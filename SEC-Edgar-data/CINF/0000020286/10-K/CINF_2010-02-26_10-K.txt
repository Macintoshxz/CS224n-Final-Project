Business Cincinnati Financial Corporation  Introduction We are an Ohio corporation formed in 1968. Our lead subsidiary, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, was founded in 1950. Our main business is property casualty insurance marketed through independent insurance agents in 37 states. Our headquarters is in Fairfield, Ohio. Atyear-end 2009, we employed 4,170associates, with 2,965headquarters associates providing support to 1,205field associates.
At year-end 2009, Cincinnati Financial Corporation owned 100 percent of three subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Insurance Company, CSU Producer Resources Inc., and CFC Investment Company. In addition, the parent company has an investment portfolio, owns the headquarters property and is responsible for corporate borrowings and shareholder dividends.
The Cincinnati Insurance Company owns 100percent of our four additional insurance subsidiaries. Our standard market property casualty insurance group includes two of those subsidiaries  The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The Cincinnati Indemnity Company. This group writes a broad range of business, homeowner and auto policies. Other subsidiaries of TheCincinnati Insurance Company include The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company, which provides life insurance, disability income policies and annuities, and The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, which began offering excess and surplus lines insurance products in January2008.
The two non-insurance subsidiaries of Cincinnati Financial are CSU Producer Resources, which offers insurance brokerage services to our independent agencies so their clients can access our excess and surplus lines insurance products; and CFC Investment Company, which offers commercial leasing and financing services to our agents, their clients and other customers.
Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available, free of charge, on our Web site, www.cinfin.com/investors , as soon as possible after they have been filed with the SEC. These filings include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Inthe following pages we reference various Web sites. These Web sites, including our own, are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Periodically, we refer to estimated industry data so that we can give information about our performance versus the overall insurance industry. Unless otherwise noted, the industry data is prepared by A.M.BestCo., a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and insurer financial strength and credit rating organization. Information from A.M. Best is presented on a statutory basis. When we provide our results on a comparable statutory basis, we label it as such; all other company data is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
Our Business and Our Strategy Introduction The Cincinnati Insurance Company was founded 60 years ago by four independent insurance agents. They established the mission that continues to guide all of the companies in the Cincinnati Financial family  to grow profitably and enhance the ability of local independent insurance agents to deliver quality financial protection to the people and businesses they serve by:  providing       market stability through financial strength  producing       competitive, up-to-date products and services  developing       associates committed to superior service A select group of agencies in 37 states actively markets our property casualty insurance within their communities. Standard market commercial lines policies aremarketed in all of those states, while personal lines policies are marketed in 29 of those states. Excess and surplus lines policies are available in 36 of those states. Within this select group, we also seek to become the life insurance carrier of choice and to help agents and their clients  our policyholders  by offering leasing and financing services.
Page 1 Three competitive advantages distinguish our company, positioning us to build shareholder value and overall long-term success:  Commitment       to our network of professional independent insurance agencies and to their       continued success  Financial       strength that lets us be a consistent market for our agents business,       supporting stability andconfidence  Operating       structure that supports local decision making, showcasing our claims       excellence and allowing us to balance growth with underwriting       discipline Independent Insurance Agency Marketplace The U.S. property casualty insurance industry is a highly competitive marketplace with over 2,000 stock and mutual companies operating independently or in groups. No single company or group dominates across all productlines and states. Standard market insurance companies (carriers) can market a broad array of products nationally or:  choose       to sell a limited product line or only one type of insurance (monoline       carrier)  target       a certain segment of the market (for example, personal       insurance)  focus       on one or more states or regions (regional   carrier) Standard market property casualty insurers generally offer insurance products through one or more distribution channels:  independent       agents, who represent multiple carriers  captive       agents, who represent one carrier exclusively,   or  direct       marketing to consumers For the most part, we compete with standard market insurance companies that market through independent insurance agents. Agencies marketing our commercial lines products typically represent six to 12 standard market insurance carriers for commercial lines products, including both national and regional carriers, some of which may be mutual companies. Our agencies typically represent four to six standard personal lines carriers, and we also compete with carriers that market personal lines products through captive agents and direct writers. Distribution though independent insurance agents or brokers represents nearly 60 percent of overall U.S. property casualty insurance premiums and approximately 80 percent of commercial property casualty insurance premiums, according to studies by the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America.
We are committed exclusively to the independent agency channel. Theindependent agencies that we choose to market our standard lines insurance products share our philosophies. They do business person to person; offer broad, value-added services; maintain sound balance sheets; and manage their agencies professionally. We develop our relationships with agencies that are active in their local communities, providing important knowledge of local market trends, opportunities and challenges.
In addition to the standard market for property casualty insurance, the excess and surplus lines market exists due to a regulatory distinction. Generally, excess and surplus lines insurance carriers provide insurance that is unavailable in the standard market due to market conditions or due to characteristics of the insured person or organization that are caused by nature, the insured's claim history or the characteristics of their business. Insurers operating in the excess and surplus lines market generally market business through excess and surplus lines insurance brokers, whether they are small specialty insurers or specialized divisions of larger insurance organizations.
We opened our own excess and surplus lines insurance brokerage firm so that we could offer excess and surplus lines products exclusively to the independent agents who market our other property casualty insurance products. We also market life insurance products through the agencies that market our property casualty products, and through other independent agencies that represent The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company without also representing our other subsidiaries.
At year-end 2009, our 1,180 property casualty agency relationships were marketing our standard market insurance products out of 1,463 reporting locations. An increasing number of agencies have multiple, separately identifiable locations, reflecting their growth and consolidation of ownership within the independent agency marketplace. Thenumber of reporting agency locations indicates our agents regional scope and the extent of our presence within our 37active states. At year-end 2008, our 1,133agency relationships had 1,387 reporting locations. At year-end 2007, our 1,092 agency relationships had 1,327reporting locations.
On average, we have an 11.1 percent share of the property casualty insurance purchased through our reporting agency locations. Our share is 16.7 percent in reporting agency locations that have represented us for more than 10years; 5.9 percent in agencies that have represented us for five to 10years; 3.9percent in agencies that have represented us for one to five years; and 0.6 percent in agencies that have represented us for less than one year.
Page 2 Our largest single agency relationship accounted for approximately 1.2percent of our total property casualty earned premiums in 2009. No aggregate locations under a single ownership structure accounted for more than 2.2percent of our earned premiums in 2009.
Financial Strength We believe that our financial strength and strong surplus position, reflected in our insurer financial strength ratings, are clear, competitive advantages in the segments of the insurance marketplace that we serve. This strength supports the consistent, predictable performance that our policyholders, agents, associates and shareholders have always expected and received, helping us withstand significant challenges.
While the prospect exists for short-term financial performance volatility due to our exposures to potential catastrophes or significant capital market losses, the ratings agencies consistently have asserted that we have built appropriate financial strength and flexibility to manage that volatility. We remain committed to strategies that emphasize being a consistent, stable market for our agents business over short-term benefits that might accrue by quick, opportunistic reaction to changes in market conditions.
At year-end 2009 and 2008, risk-based capital (RBC) for our standard and excess and surplus lines property casualty operations and life operations was very strong, far exceeding regulatoryrequirements.
We       ended 2009 with a 0.8-to-1 ratio of property casualty premiums to surplus,       a key measure of property casualty insurance company capacity. Our ratio       gives us the flexibility to diversify risk by expanding our operations       into new geographies and product areas. The estimated industry average       ratio also was 0.8to1 for 2009. The lower the ratio, the       greater capacity an insurer has for growth.
We       ended 2009 with a 16.3 percent ratio of life statutory adjusted risk-based       surplus to liabilities, a key measure of life insurance company capital       strength. The estimated industry average ratio was 10.0percent for       2009. A higher ratio indicates an insurers stronger security for       policyholders and capacity to support   businessgrowth.

The life insurance companys ratio was 32.2 percent compared with 39.2percent a year ago.
Cincinnati Financial Corporations senior debt is rated by four independent ratings firms. In addition, the ratings firms award our property casualty and life operations insurer financial strength ratings based on their quantitative and qualitative analyses. These ratings assess an insurers ability to meet financial obligations to policyholders and do not necessarily address all of the matters that may be important to shareholders. Ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
All of our insurance subsidiaries continue to be highly rated. During 2009, Fitch Ratings lowered our ratings as described below. No other ratings agency actions occurred during 2009.

Our parent company senior debt rating was lowered from A- to BBB+ and our standard market property casualty subsidiaries insurance and life insurance subsidiary financial strength ratings were lowered from AA- to A+. Fitch said the rating action was primarily driven by our unfavorable property casualty underwriting performance during 2008 and the first half of 2009. Fitch said it viewed favorably our steps taken with our investment portfolio. Fitch also noted our strong capitalization and low operating leverage. Noother ratings agency actions occurred during 2009.
On February 18, 2010, A.M. Best affirmed our ratings that it had assigned in December 2008, continuing its stable outlook. A.M. Best cited our superior risk-adjusted capitalization, strong five-year average operating performance, historically redundant reserves and successful distribution within our targeted regional markets. A.M. Best noted that common stock leverage was approximately 50 percent of statutory surplus at year-end 2009, a concern offset by our conservative underwriting and reserving philosophies, with loss reserves more than fully covered by a highly rated, diversified bond portfolio.
Our debt ratings are discussed in Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Additional Sources of Liquidity, Page 69.
Operating Structure We offer our broad array of insurance products through the independent agency channel. We recognize that locally based independent agencies have relationships in their communities and local marketplace intelligence that can lead to policyholder satisfaction, loyalty and profitable business. We seek to be a consistent and predictable property casualty carrier that agencies can rely on to serve their clients. For our standard market business, field and headquarters underwriters make risk-specific decisions about both new business and renewals.
In our 10 highest volume states for consolidated property casualty premiums, 933 reporting agency locations wrote68.1 percent of our 2009 consolidated property casualty earned premium volume compared with 910 locations and 68.7percent in 2008.

These associates live in the communities our agents serve, working from offices in their homes and providing 24/7 availability to our agents. Headquarters associates also provide agencies with underwriting, accounting and technology assistance and training. Company executives, headquarters underwriters and special teams regularly travel to visit agencies, strengthening the personal relationships we have with these organizations. Agents have opportunities for direct, personal conversations with our senior management team, and headquarters associates have opportunities to refresh their knowledge of marketplace conditions and field activities.
The field team is coordinated by field marketing representatives responsible for underwriting new commercial lines business. They are joined by field representatives specializing in claims, loss control, personal lines, machinery and equipment, bond, premium audit, life insurance and leasing. The field team provides many services for agencies and policyholders; for example, our field loss control representatives and others specializing in machinery and equipment risks perform inspections and recommend specific actions to improve the safety of the policyholders operations and the quality of the agents account.
Agents work with us to carefully select risks and assure pricing adequacy. They appreciate the time our associates invest in creating solutions for their clients while protecting profitability, whether that means working on an individual case or customizing policy terms and conditions that preserve flexibility, choice and other sales advantages. We seek to develop long-term relationships by understanding the unique needs of their clients, who are also our policyholders.
We also are responsive to agent needs for well designed property casualty products. Our commercial lines products are structured to allow flexible combinations of property and liability coverages in a single package with a single expiration date and several payment options. This approach brings policyholders convenience, discounts and a reduced risk of coverage gaps or disputes. At the same time, it increases account retention and saves time and expense for the agency and our company.
We seek to employ technology solutions and business process improvements that:  allow       our field and headquarters associates to collaborate with each other and       with agencies moreefficiently  provide       our agencies the ability to access our systems and client data to process       business transactions from their offices  allow       policyholders to directly access pertinent policy information online in       order to further improve efficiency for our   agencies  automate       our internal processes so our associates can spend more time serving       agents and policyholders, and  reduce       duplicated effort, introducing more efficient processes that reduce       company and agencycosts.
Page 5 Agencies access our systems and other electronic services via their agency management systems or CinciLink  , our secure agency-only Web site. CinciLink provides an array of Web-based services and content that makes doing business with us easier, such as commercial and personal lines rating and processing systems, policy loss information, sales and marketing materials, educational courses about our products and services, accounting services, and electronic libraries for property and casualty coverage forms and state rating manuals.
Superior Claims Service Our claims philosophy reflects our belief that we will prosper as a company by responding to claims person to person, paying covered claims promptly, preventing false claims from unfairly adding to overall premiums and building financial strength to meet future obligations.
Our 771 locally based field claims representatives work from their homes, assigned to specific agencies. Theyrespond personally to policyholders and claimants, typically within 24 hours of receiving an agencys claim report. We believe we have a competitive advantage because of the person-to-person approach and the resulting high level of service that our field claims representatives provide. We also help our agencies provide prompt service to policyholders by giving agencies authority to immediately pay most first-party claims under standard market policies up to $2,500. We believe this same local approach to handling claims is a competitive advantage for our agents providing excess and surplus lines coverage in their communities. Handling of these claims includes guidance from headquarters-based excess and surplus lines claims managers.
Our property casualty claims operation uses CMS, our claims management system, to streamline processes and achieve operational efficiencies. CMS allows field and headquarters claims associates to collaborate on reported claims through a virtual claim file. Our field claims representatives use tablet computers to view and enter information into CMS from any location, including an insureds home or agents office, and to print claim checks using portable printers. Agencies can also access selected CMS information such as activity notes on open claims.
Catastrophe response teams are comprised of volunteers from our experienced field claims staff, and we give them the tools and authority they need to do their jobs. In times of widespread loss, our field claims representatives confidently and quickly resolve claims, often writing checks on the same day they inspect the loss. CMS introduced new efficiencies that are especially evident during catastrophes. Electronic claim files allow for fast initial contact of policyholders and easy sharing of information and data by rotating storm teams, headquarters and local field claims representatives. When hurricanes or other weather events are predicted, we can choose to have catastrophe response team members travel to strategic locations near the expected impact area. They are in position to quickly get to the affected area, set up temporary offices and start calling on policyholders.
Our claims associates work to control costs where appropriate. They use vendor resources that provide negotiated pricing to our insureds and claimants. Our field claims representatives also are educated continuously on new techniques and repair trends. They can leverage their local knowledge and experience with area body shops, which helps them negotiate the right price with any facility the policyholder chooses.
We staff a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) with former law enforcement and claims professionals whose qualifications make them uniquely suited to gathering facts to uncover potential fraud. While we believe our job is to pay what is due under each policy contract, we also want to prevent false claims from unfairly increasing overall premiums. Our SIU also operates a computer forensic lab, using sophisticated software to recover data and mitigate the cost of computer-related claims for business interruption and loss of records.
Loss and Loss Expense Reserves When claims are made by or against policyholders, any amounts that our property casualty operations pay or expect to pay for covered claims are losses. The costs we incur in investigating, resolving and processing these claims are loss expenses. Our consolidated financial statements include property casualty loss and loss expense reserves that estimate the costs of not-yet-paid claims incurred through December 31 of each year. The reserves include estimates for claims that have been reported to us plus our estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR), along with our estimate for loss expenses associated with processing and settling those claims. We develop the various estimates based on individual claim evaluations and statistical projections. We reduce the loss reserves by an estimate for the amount of salvage and subrogation we expect to recover. We encourage you to review several sections of the Managements Discussion and Analysis where we discuss our loss reserves in greater depth. In Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 38, we discuss our process for analyzing potential losses and establishing reserves. In Item 7, Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Obligations and Reserves, Page 71, and Life Insurance Policyholder Obligations and Reserves, Page 78, we review reserve levels, including 10-year development of our property casualty lossreserves.
Page 6 Insurance Products We actively market property casualty insurance in 37 states through a select group of independent insurance agencies. Our standard market commercial lines products are marketed in all of those states while our standard market personal lines products are marketed in 29. We discuss our commercial lines and personal lines insurance operations and products in Commercial Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment, Page 12, and Personal Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment, Page 15. Atyear-end 2009, CSU Producer Resources marketed our excess and surplus lines products to agencies in 36 states that represent Cincinnati Insurance.
The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company began excess and surplus lines insurance operations in January2008. We structured this operation to exclusively serve the needs of the independent agencies that currently market our standard market insurance policies. When all or a portion of a current or potential clients insurance program requires excess and surplus lines coverages, those agencies can write the whole account with Cincinnati, gaining benefits not often found in the broader excess and surplus lines market. Agencies have access to The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Companys product line through CSU Producer Resources Inc., the wholly owned insurance brokerage subsidiary of parent-company Cincinnati Financial Corporation.
Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters and CSU Producer Resources employ a Web-based policy administration system to quote, bind, issue and deliver policies electronically to agents. This system also provides integration to existing document management and data management systems, allowing for straight-through processing of policies and billing.
We also support the independent agencies affiliated with our property casualty operations in their programs to sell life insurance. The products offered by our life insurance subsidiary round out and protect accounts and improve account persistency. At the same time, our life operation increases diversification of revenue and profitability sources for both the agency and our company.
Our property casualty agencies make up the main distribution system for our life insurance products. To help build scale, we also develop life business from other independent life insurance agencies in geographic markets underserved through our property casualty agencies. We are careful to solicit business from these other agencies in a manner that does not compete with the life insurance marketing and sales efforts of our property casualty agencies. Our life insurance operation emphasizes up-to-date products, responsive underwriting, high quality service and competitive pricing.
Other Services to Agencies We complement the insurance operations by providing products and services that help attract and retain high-quality independent insurance agencies. When we appoint agencies, we look for organizations with knowledgeable, professional staffs. In turn, we make an exceptionally strong commitment to assist them in keeping their knowledge up to date and educating new people they bring on board as they grow. Numerous activities fulfill this commitment at our headquarters, in regional and agency locations andonline.
Except travel-related expenses for classes held at our headquarters, most programs are offered at no cost to our agencies. While that approach may be extraordinary in our industry today, the result is quality service for our policyholders and increased success for our independent agencies.
In addition to broad education and training support, we make non-insurance financial services available through CFC Investment Company. CFCInvestment Company offers equipment and vehicle leases and loans for independent insurance agencies, their commercial clients and other businesses. It also provides commercial real estate loans to help agencies operate and expand their businesses. We believe that providing these services enhances agency relationships with the company and their clients, increasing loyalty while diversifying the agencys revenues.
Page 7 Strategic Initiatives Management has identified strategies that can position us for long-term success. The board of directors and management believe that execution of our strategic plan will create significant value for shareholders over time. We broadly group these strategies into three areas of focus  managing capital effectively, improving insurance profitability and driving premium growth  correlating with the primary ways we measure our progress toward our long-term financial objectives. Our strategies are intended to position us to compete successfully in the markets we have targeted while seeking to optimize the balance of risk and returns. We believe successful implementation of the initiatives that support our strategies will help us better serve our agent customers, reduce volatility in our financial results and achieve our long-term objectives despite shorter-term effects of difficult economic, market or pricing cycles. We describe our expectations for the results of these initiatives in Item 7, Executive Summary of the Managements Discussion and Analysis, Page34.
Manage Capital Effectively Our first strategy is a continuing focus on managing capital effectively. This strategy serves as a foundation supporting other strategies focused on profitably growing our insurance business, with the overall objective of building capital for the long-term benefit of shareholders. Implementation of the initiatives below that support our capital management strategy is intended to preserve our capital while maintaining appropriate liquidity. A strong capital position provides the capacity to support premium growth and liquidity provides for our investment in the people and infrastructure needed to implement our other strategic initiatives. Our strong capital and liquidity also provide financial flexibility for shareholder dividends or other capital management actions.
The primary capital management initiatives are:  Maintain       a diversified investment portfolio by reviewing and applying       diversification parameters and tolerances  We discuss our portfolio       strategies in greater depth in Investments Segment, Page     18.
o High-quality       fixed-maturity portfolio that exceeds total insurance reserves  At       year-end 2009, the average rating of the $7.855 billion fixed maturity       portfolio was A2/A. The risk of potential decline of capital due to lower       bond values during periods of increasing interest rates is managed in part       through a generally laddered maturity schedule for this portfolio, as       approximately 28 percent will mature in the next five years. The portfolio       value exceeded total insurance reserve liability by 32.6 percent. In       addition, we have assets in the form of receivables from reinsurers, most       with A.M. Best insurer financial strength ratings of A or better. These       assets directly related to insurance reserves, offsetting over 10 percent       of that liability.
o Diversified       equity portfolio that has no concentrated positions in single stocks or       industries  Atyear-end 2009, no single security accounted for more       than 5.8 percent of our portfolio of publicly traded common stocks, and no       single sector accounted for more than 18.0percent. Because of the       strength of our fixed-maturity portfolio, we have the opportunity to       invest for potential capital appreciation by purchasing equity securities.       We seek to achieve a total return on the equity portfolio over any       five-year period that exceeds that of the Standard & Poors 500 Index       while taking similar or less risk.
o Parent       company liquidity that increases our flexibility through all periods to       maintain our cash dividendand to continue to invest in and expand       our insurance operations  Atyear-end 2009, weheld       $1.040billion of our cash and invested assets at the parent company       level, of which $683million, or 65.7percent, was invested in       common stocks, and $54 million, or 5.2percent, was cash or       cashequivalents.
Develop       a comprehensive, enterprise-level catastrophe management program        Weather-related catastrophe losses for our property casualty business can       significantly affect capital and cause earnings volatility. Key objectives       of a comprehensive program include identifying an overall tolerance for       catastrophe risk as well as regional guidelines that work with our       underwriting and reinsurance efforts. An important element of this       initiative continues to be obtaining reinsurance from highly rated       reinsurers to mitigate underwriting risk and to support our ability to       hold investments until maturity. See Item 7, 2010 Reinsurance Programs,       Page 79, for additional details on these   programs.
Minimize       reliance on debt as a source of capital, maintaining the ratio of       debt-to-total capital below 20percent  This target is higher than       we had identified prior to 2008 because total capital declined in 2008       although debt levels were essentially unchanged. At year-end 2009, this       ratio was 15.0percent compared with 16.7 percent at year-end 2008       and 12.7 percent at year-end 2007. Our long-term debt consists of three       non-convertible, non-callable debentures, two due in 2028 and one       in2034.
Page 8  Identify       tolerances for other operational risks and calibrate management decisions       accordingly  Among the areas of focus during 2009 was exposure to risks       related to disaster recovery and business continuity. We completed a       conversion to a new information technology back-up data center and       continued work to address the risks associated with a concentration of       support operations at our headquarters location. Our enterprise risk       management efforts also include evaluating emerging risks such as       potential changes in regulation at both the state and federal levels and       the potential effects of increased inflation on assets and       liabilities.
We measure the overall success of our strategy to effectively manage capital primarily by growing investment income and by achieving over any five-year period a total return on our equity investment portfolio that exceeds the Standard & Poors 500s return. Investment income grew at a compound annual rate of 0.3 percent over the five years ended December 31, 2009. It grew during 2005 through 2007, then declined during 2008 and 2009 when we experienced a dramatic reduction in dividends from financial services companies held in our equity portfolio, a risk we addressed aggressively during 2008 and early 2009. Over the five years ended December 31, 2009, our compound annual equity portfolio return was negative 5.8 percent compared with a compound annual total return of 0.4percent for the S&P 500 Index. Our equity portfolio underperformed the market for the five-year period primarily because of the decline in the market value of Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB), our largest holding for most of theperiod. We have not owned any shares of Fifth Third common stock since early 2009.
We also monitor other measures. One of the most significant is our ratio of property casualty net written premiums to statutory surplus, which was 0.8-to-1 at year-end 2009 compared with 0.9-to-1 at year-end 2008 and 0.7-to-1 at year-end 2007. This ratio is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty industry; the lower the ratio the more capacity a company has for premium growth. The estimated property casualty industry net written premium to statutory surplus ratio also was 0.8-to-1 at year-end 2009, 0.9-to-1 at year-end 2008 and 0.8-to-1 at year-end 2007.
Our second means of verifying our capital preservation strategy is our financial strength ratings as discussed in Our Business and Our Strategy, Page 1. All of our insurance subsidiaries continue to be highly rated. A third means is measurement of our risk-based capital ratios, which currently indicate that our insurance subsidiaries are operating with a level of capital far exceeding regulatory requirements.
Improve Insurance Profitability Our second strategy is to improve insurance profitability. Implementation of the operational initiatives below is intended to improve pricing capabilities for our property casualty business and improve our efficiency. Improved pricing helps us manage profit margins and greater efficiency helps control costs, together improving overall profitability. These initiatives also seek to help the agencies that represent us to grow profitably by allowing them to serve clients faster and manage expenses better. The primary initiatives to improve insurance profitability are:  Improve       underwriting expertise  While most of our lines of business have       maintained underwriting profitability, we must continue to improve our       capabilities in risk selection and pricing. For the lines of business that       are underperforming or that involve larger or more complex risks, we take       a comprehensive approach  with collaborative expertise among associates       from underwriting, claims, loss control, marketing, actuarial services and       premium audit  to work toward restoring underwriting profitability.       Specific initiatives that are key to improving profitability are       summarized below.
o Improve       pricing capabilities in each line of business  Predictive modeling tools       that better align individual insurance policy pricing to risk attributes       and claims practices are already in use for our homeowner and workers       compensation lines of business. We are developing predictive models for       all major lines of commercial insurance and for our personal auto line of       business. Predictive modeling tools increase pricing precision so we can       more effectively evaluate and appropriately price insured risks, improving       our ability to compete for the most desirable business within our       agencies. Use of our predictive modeling tool for workers compensation       began in 2009and is anticipated to meaningfully improve the loss       ratio for this line of business over time. During 2009 we began using an       enhanced version of predictive modeling for our homeowner line of       business, helping to further improve our rate and credit structures for       attracting and retaining more accounts with the best prospects of       long-term profitability. Our efforts to better match insured risks with       appropriate policy pricing are expected to improve overall underwriting       profitability for our property casualty   business.
o Improving       our business data, supporting accurate underwriting, pricing and decisions        Over the next several years, we will deploy a full data management       program, including a data warehouse for our property casualty and life       insurance operations that will provide enhanced granularity of pricing       data. This is a phased, long-term project that is currently in       progress.
Page 9  Improve       expense management to make the best use of our resources  During 2009, we       have invested in technology and workflow improvements that will help us       improve efficiency and grow our business, when insurance market conditions       improve, without proportional increases in expenses. Through careful       allocation of staff, we have added associates in areas of strategic       significance while realizing efficiencies in other areas, resulting in a       slight reduction in the overall number of associates during 2009. We       continue to work toward improving efficiency through efforts such as       studies of transactional workflows and development of an energy efficiency       plan for our headquarters buildings.
Develop       and deploy technology plans  Technology continues to be key for improving       efficiencies and streamlining processes for our agencies, allowing us to       win an increasing share of their most profitable business. We will       continue to integrate solutions across business lines to make it easier       for agents to do business with us and to maximize product cross-serving       while reducing duplication of effort. Our technology initiatives serve to       enhance our tradition of local decision making based on the local       knowledge and risk selection expertise we derive from our agents and from       having a large network of field representatives who live and work in our       agents communities. Ongoing technology development contributes to       improved profitability by enhancing internal efficiency and the       organization of business data used for underwriting and pricing.       Technology development and deployment will reflect our vision of the       services that our agents will need in the short and long terms. These       technology solutions will be prioritized to optimize their delivery.       Progress during 2009and future plans for major technology       initiatives are highlighted below.
o Commercial       lines policy administration system  In the fourth quarter of 2009, we       deployed a new system called e-CLAS  CPP for commercial package and auto coverages to all of our appointed       agencies in 11 states. Those states produce approximately 55 percent of       our commercial premium volume. We plan to deploy the system to as many as       19 additional states in 2010. The new system includes real-time quoting       and policy issuance, direct bill capabilities with several payment plans,       and interface capabilities to transfer selected policy data from agency       management systems. We believe the new system will further improve our       position among the go-to carriers for our agencies, having a positive       impact on future growth of profitable commercial lines       business.
o Personal       lines policy administration system  During 2009, we developed the next       version of this system, Diamond 5.x, and moved our personal lines policy       processing system to this next generation platform in early 2010. The       Web-based system supports agency efficiency through pre-filling of       selected policy data and easy-to-use screens. We continue to focus on       making it easier for our agents to dobusiness with us, which we       believe will significantly benefit our objective of writing their highest       quality accounts with superior profit margins.
We measure the overall success of our strategy to improve insurance profitability primarily through ourGAAPcombined ratio, which we believe can be consistently below 100 percent over any five-yearperiod.
In addition, we expect these initiatives to contribute to our rank as the No. 1 or No. 2 carrier based on premium volume in agencies that have represented us for at least five years. In 2009, we again earned that rank in more than 75 percent of the agencies that have represented Cincinnati Insurance for more than fiveyears, based on 2008 premiums. We are working to increase the percentage of agencies where we have achieved that rank.
Drive Premium Growth Our third strategy is to drive premium growth. Implementation of the operational initiatives below is intended to expand our geographic footprint and diversify our premium sources to obtain profitable growth without significant infrastructure expense. Diversified growth may also reduce our catastrophe exposure risk and temper negative changes that may occur in the economic, judicial or regulatory environments in the territories we serve.
The primary initiatives to drive premium growth are:  New       agency appointments in 2010  We continue to appoint new agencies in our       current operating territories, adding 87 in 2009. Our objective is to       appoint additional points of distribution, focusing on markets where our       market share is less than 1 percent while also considering economic and       catastrophe risk factors. In 2010, we are targeting 65appointments       of independent agencies writing an aggregate $1 billion in property       casualty premiums annually with all carriers they     represent.
Page 10 In measuring progress toward achieving this initiative, we include appointment of new agency relationships with Cincinnati. For those that we believe will produce a meaningful amount of newbusiness premiums, we also include appointment of agencies that merge with a Cincinnati agency and new branch offices opened by existing Cincinnati agencies. We made 87, 76 and 66new appointments in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these new appointments, 65,52and 50, respectively, were new relationships. These new appointments and other changes in agency structures led to a net increase in reporting agency locations of 76 in 2009, 60 in 2008 and 38 in 2007. We seek to build a close, long-term relationship with each agency we appoint. We carefully evaluate the marketing reach of each new appointment to ensure the territory can support both current and new agencies.
Earn       a larger share of business with currently appointed agents  We will       continue to execute on growth initiatives from prior years and will focus       on the key components of agent satisfaction based on factors agents find       most important. This will include measurements to identify key factors and       gauge progress in our performance for delivering     satisfaction.
o Deploy       new products and service enhancements that address agents needs  In       addition to meeting the needs of our agents and their clients, new product       development will target markets with above-average profitability to reduce       market-cycle volatility. This initiative will expand beyond the specialty       package options currently offered through our commercial lines operation,       with a focus on identifying promising classes of business and increasing       our product advantages and product support.
o New       states  With our entry into Colorado and Wyoming during 2009 and Texas in       late 2008, Cincinnati Insurance now is actively marketing our policies in       37 states, expanding our opportunities beyond the Midwest and South. We       now have a growing presence in the western states  opening New Mexico and       eastern Washington in 2007, Utah in 2000, Idaho in 1999 and Montana in       1998. We entered Arizona in 1971. While we continually study the       regulatory and competitive environment in other states where we could       decide to actively market our property casualty products, we have not       announced specifics regarding entry into new   states.
We generally are able to earn a 10 percent share of an agencys business within 10 years of its appointment. We also help our agents grow their business by attracting more clients in their communities through the unique style of service we offer. In New Mexico and eastern Washington, weve appointed 13 agencies since early 2007 that currently write about $260million annually with all the carriers they represent. During 2009, our written premiums with agencies in these two new states totaled almost 5 percent of that total agency annual premium volume. In Texas, where we made 20 agency appointments through the year, those agencies wrote over $10million of Cincinnati Insurance premiums in 2009. By mid 2010, we expect to have appointed Texas agencies that currently write a total of about $750million in premiums annually with all carriers they represent, an indication of strong potential for future premium growth.
o Excess       & Surplus lines insurance  Another source of premium growth is our       excess and surplus lines operation with products available in 37 states.       We entered this market in 2008 to better serve agents of The Cincinnati       Insurance Companies  ,       initially offering general liability coverage. Today, those agents write       about $2.5 billion annually of surplus lines business with other carriers.       We plan to earn a profitable share by bringing Cincinnati-style service to       agents and policyholders. In late 2008, we expanded product offerings       beyond the general liability, adding property and professional liability       lines of businesses. In late 2009, we began offering excess casualty       coverage. During 2009, net written premiums were $39million compared       with $14million in 2008, our initial year for excess and surplus       lines operations.
o Personal       lines  We continue to position our personal lines business for profitable       future growth as pricing refinements and improved ease of use expand our       agents opportunities to market Cincinnatis policy advantages to their       more quality-conscious clientele. Enhancement of our tiered rating during       2009 helped to further improve our rate and credit structures to attract       and retain more accounts with the best prospects of long-term       profitability. Personal lines rate changes made in 2008 and 2009 plus       expansion of our personal lines operation into new states drove strong new       business, which increased by 80.6 percent for the year     2009.
We continue to see the effects of executing on our potential to market personal lines insurance through agencies that already represent us for commercial lines. In early 2009, we began marketing personal lines in two additional states, bringing the total of states where we market personal lines to 29. In seven states where we began writing personal lines business or significantly expanded our product offerings and automation capabilities in 2008 or 2009, our agencies write approximately $650million in personal lines premiums annually with all carriersthey represent. This initiative produced an increase of $13 million in 2009 new businesspremiums.
Page 11 We measure the overall success of this strategy to drive premium growth primarily through changes in net written premiums, which we believe can grow faster than the industry average over any five-year period. For 2009, our property casualty net written premiums declined by 3.3 percent, comparing favorably with the estimated 4.2 percent decline for the industry.
Our Segments Consolidated financial results primarily reflect the results of our four reporting segments. These segments are defined based on financial information we use to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of assets.
Commercial       lines property casualty insurance  Personal       lines property casualty insurance  Life       insurance  Investments We also evaluate results for our consolidated property casualty operations, which is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and excess and surplus lines results.
Revenues, income before income taxes and identifiable assets for each segment are shown in a table in Item8, Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page115. Some of that information also is discussed in this section of this report, where we explain the business operations of each segment. Thefinancial performance of each segment is discussed in the Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which begins on Page 34.
Commercial Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment The commercial lines property casualty insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of $2.199billion to total revenues, or 56.3 percent of that total, and reported a loss before income taxes of $35million in 2009. Commercial lines net earned premiums declined 5.1 percent and 3.9 percent in 2009and 2008 after growing 0.4 percent in 2007.
Approximately 95 percent of our commercial lines premiums are written to provide accounts with coverages from more than one of our business lines. As a result, we believe that our commercial lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. However, we provide line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for our business lines. The seven commercial business lines are:  Commercial       casualty  Commercial casualty insurance provides coverage to businesses       against third-party liability from accidents occurring on their premises       or arising out of their operations, including liability coverage for       injuries sustained from products sold as well as coverage for professional       services, such as dentistry. Specialized casualty policies may include       liability coverage for employment practices liability (EPLI), which       protects businesses against claims by employees that their legal rights as       employees of the company have been violated, and other acts or failures to       act under specified circumstances as well as excess insurance and umbrella       liability, including personal umbrella liability written as an endorsement       to commercial umbrella coverages. The commercial casualty business line       includes liability coverage written on both a discounted and       non-discounted basis as part of commercial package     policies.
Commercial       property  Commercial property insurance provides coverage for loss or       damage to buildings, inventory and equipment caused by covered causes of       loss such as fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism, as well as       business interruption resulting from a covered loss. Commercial property       also includes crime insurance, which provides coverage for losses such as       embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee, among others;       and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for a variety of       mobile equipment, such as contractors equipment, builders risk, cargo       and electronic data processing equipment. Various property coverages can       be written as stand-alone policies or can be added to a package policy.       The commercial property business line includes propertycoverage       written on both a non-discounted and discounted basis as part of       commercial package policies.
Commercial       auto  Commercial auto coverages protect businesses against liability to       others for both bodily injury and property damage, medical payments to       insureds and occupants of their vehicles, physical damage to an insureds       own vehicle from collision and various other perils, and damages caused by       uninsured motorists.
Workers       compensation  Workers compensation coverage protects employers against       specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace       injuries to employees. We write workers compensation coverage in all of       our active states except North Dakota, Ohio and Washington, where coverage       is provided solely by the state instead of by private       insurers.
Specialty       packages  Specialty packages include coverages for property, liability       and business interruption tailored to meet the needs of specific industry       classes, such as artisan contractors, Page 12 dentists, garage operators, financial institutions, metalworkers, printers, religious institutions, or smaller, main street businesses. Businessowners policies, which combine property, liability and business interruption coverages for small businesses, are included in specialty packages.
Surety       and executive risk  This business line   includes: o Contract       and commercial surety bonds, which guarantee a payment or reimbursement       for financial losses resulting from dishonesty, failure to perform and       other acts.
o Fidelity       bonds, which cover losses that policyholders incur as a result of       fraudulent acts by specified individuals or dishonest acts by       employees.
o Director       and officer liability insurance, which covers liability for actual or       alleged errors in judgment, breaches of duty or other wrongful acts       related to activities of for-profit or nonprofit organizations. Our       director and officer liability policy can optionally include EPLI       coverage.
Machinery       and equipment  Specialized machinery and equipment coverage can provide       protection for loss or damage to boilers and machinery, including       production and computer equipment, from sudden and accidental mechanical       breakdown, steam explosion or artificially generated       electricalcurrent.
Our emphasis is on products that agents can market to small- to mid-size businesses in their communities. Ofour 1,463 reporting agency locations, nine market only our surety and executive risk products and fivemarket only our personal lines products. The remaining 1,449 locations, located in allstates in which we actively market, offer some or all of our standard market commercial insuranceproducts.
In 2009, our 10 highest volume commercial lines states generated 65.3 percent of our earned premiumscompared with 65.9 percent in the prior year as we continued efforts to geographically diversify our property casualty risks. Earned premiums in the 10 highest volume states decreased 5.2percent in 2009 and decreased 4.8 percent in the remaining 27 states. The number of reporting agency locations in our 10 highest volume states increased to 933 in 2009 from 905 in 2008.

Our agents and our field marketing, claims, loss control, premium audit, bond and machinery and equipment representatives get to know the people and businesses in their communities and can make informed decisions about each risk. These field marketing representatives also are responsible for selecting new independent agencies, coordinating field teams of specialized company representatives and promoting all of the company's products within the agencies they serve.
Commercial lines policy renewals are managed by headquarters underwriters who are assigned to specific agencies and consult with local field staff as needed. As part of our team approach, the headquarters underwriter also helps oversee agency growth and profitability. They are responsible for formal issuance of all new business and renewal policies as well as policy endorsements. Further, the headquarters underwriters provide day-to-day customer service to agencies and marketing representatives by offering product training, answering underwritingquestions, helping to determine underwriting eligibility and assisting with the mechanics of premiumdetermination.
Page 13 Our commercial lines packages are typically offered on a three-year policy term for most insurance coverages, a key competitive advantage. In our experience, multi-year packages appeal to the quality-conscious insurance buyers who we believe are typical clients of our independent agents. Customized insurance programs on a three-year term complement the long-term relationships these policyholders typically have with their agents and with the company. By reducing annual administrative efforts, multi-year policies lower expenses for our company and for our agents. The commitment we make to policyholders encourages long-term relationships and reduces their need to annually re-evaluate their insurance carrier or agency. We believe that the advantages of three-year policies in terms of improved policyholder convenience, increased account retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential disadvantage of these policies, even in periods of risingrates.
Although we offer three-year policy terms, premiums for some coverages within those policies are adjustable at anniversary for the next annual period, and policies may be canceled at any time at the discretion of the policyholder. Contract terms often provide that rates for property, general liability, inland marine and crime coverages, as well as policy terms and conditions, are fixed for the term of the policy. Thegeneral liability exposure basis may be audited annually. Commercial auto, workers compensation, professional liability and most umbrella liability coverages within multi-year packages are rated at each of the policy's annual anniversaries for the next one-year period. The annual pricing could incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance regulatory authorities between the date the policy was written and its annual anniversary date, as well as changes in risk exposures and premium credits or debits relating to lossexperience and other underwriting judgment factors. We estimate that approximately 75percent of 2009 commercial premiums were subject to annual rating or were written on a one-year policy term.
Staying abreast of evolving market conditions is a critical function, accomplished in both an informal and aformal manner. Informally, our field marketing representatives and underwriters are in constant receipt of market intelligence from the agencies with which they work. Formally, our commercial lines product management group and field marketing associates conduct periodic surveys to obtain competitive intelligence. This market information helps identify the top competitors by line of business or specialty program and also identifies our market strengths and weaknesses. The analysis encompasses pricing, breadth of coverage and underwriting/eligibility issues.
In addition to reviewing our competitive position, our product management group and our underwriting audit group review compliance with our underwriting standards as well as the pricing adequacy of our commercial insurance programs and coverages. Further, our research and development group analyzes opportunities and develops new products, new coverage options and improvements to existing insurance products.
At year-end 2009, we supported our commercial lines operations with a variety of technology tools. e-CLAS for commercial package business was rolled out to 11 states by year end 2009 with an additional 19 states planned for 2010. This system allows our agencies to quote and print commercial package policies in their offices, increasing their ease of doing business with us. The e-CLAS platform also makes use of our real-time agency interface, CinciBridge  , which allows the automated movement ofkey underwriting data from an agencys management system to e-CLAS. This reduces agents data entry and allows seamless quoting, rating, and issuance capability. WinCPP  is our commercial lines premium quoting system. WinCPP is available in all of our agencylocations where we actively marketcommercial lines insurance and provides quoting capabilities for nearly 100percent of our newand renewal commercial lines business. WinCPP also works with CinciBridge.
Many small business accounts written as Businessowners Policies (BOP) and Dentists Package Policies (DBOP) are eligible to be issued at our agency locations through our e-CLAS system as well. e-CLAS providesfull policy lifecycle transactions, including quoting, issuance, policy changes, renewal processing and policy printing, at the agency location. These features make it easy and efficient for our agencies to issue and service these policies. At year-end 2009, e-CLAS for BOP and DBOP was in use in 30 states representing 98percent of our premiums for these products, which are included in the specialty packages commercial line of business. e-CLAS also uses CinciBridge to provide real-time data transfer with agency management systems.
We have been streamlining internal processes and achieving operational efficiencies in our headquarters commercial lines operations through deployment of iView, a policy imaging and workflow system. This system provides online access to electronic copies of policy files, enabling our underwriters to respond to agent requests and inquiries more quickly and efficiently. iView also automates internal workflows through electronic routing of underwriting and processing work tasks. At year-end 2009, more than 99 percent of in-force non-workers compensation commercial lines policy files were administered and stored electronically in iView. In 2010, we plan to add our workers compensation policies to i-View.
Page 14 Personal Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment The personal lines property casualty insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of $685million to total revenues, or 17.6 percent of the total, and reported a loss before income taxes of $81million in 2009. Personal lines net earned premiums declined 0.6 percent in 2009, 3.4 percent in 2008 and 6.3percent in 2007.
We prefer to write personal lines coverage in accounts that include both auto and homeowner coverages as well as coverages that are part of our other personal business line. As a result, we believe that our personal lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. However, we provide line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for three businesslines:  Personal       auto  This business line includes personal auto coverages that protect       against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage,       medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicle, physical       damage to an insureds own vehicle from collision and various other       perils, and damages caused by uninsured motorists. In addition, many       states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection,       frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.
Homeowners        This business line includes homeowner coverages that protect against       losses to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well as       liability arising out of personal activities both on and off the covered       premises. The company also offers coverage for condominium unit owners and       renters.
Other       personal lines  This includes the variety of other types of insurance       products we offer to individuals such as dwelling fire, inland marine,       personal umbrella liability and watercraft   coverages.
At year-end, we marketed personal lines insurance products through 1,059 of our 1,463reporting agency locations in 29 of the 37 states in which we offer standard market commercial lines insurance. Asdiscussed in Strategic Initiatives, Page8, introducing personal lines to these agencies is one of the ways we intend to grow profitably in the next several years. The number of reporting agency locations in our 10highest volume states increased more than 5 percent to 660 in 2009 from 627 in 2008.
In 2009, our 10 highest volume personal lines states generated 84.1 percent of our earned premiums compared with 85.1 percent in the prior year. Earned premiums in the 10highest volume states declined 1.7percent in 2009while increasing 5.9 percent in the remaining states.

Each agency selects personal lines business primarily from within the geographic territory that it serves, based on the agents knowledge of the risks in those communities or familiarity with the policyholder. Personal lines activities are supported by headquarters associates assigned to individual agencies. We now have sevenfull-time personal lines marketing representatives, who have underwriting authority and visit agencies on a regular basis. They reinforce the advantages of our personal lines products and offer training in the use of our processing system.
Page 15 Competitive advantages of our personal lines operation include broad coverage forms, flexible underwriting, superior claims service, generous credit structure and customizable endorsements for both the personal auto and homeowner policies. Our personal lines products are processed through Diamond, our real-time personal lines policy processing system that supports and allows once-and-done processing. Diamond incorporates features frequently requested by our agencies such as direct bill and monthly payment plans, local and headquarters policy printing options, data transfer to and from popular agency management systems and real-time integration with third-party data such as insurance scores, motor vehicle reports and address verification. The new web-based version of Diamond that was released to our agents in the first quarter of 2010 provides significant improvements, including more user-friendly screens and workflow plus other features such as a pre-fill option to reduce keystrokes for improved efficiency.
In 2006, we introduced PL-efiles, a policy imaging system, to our personal lines operations. Thetransition was completed in 2009 and replaces paper format with electronic copies of policy documents. PL-efiles complements the Diamond system by giving personal lines underwriters and support staff online access to policy documents and data, enabling them to respond to agent requests and inquiries quickly and efficiently. The underlying technology is updated and permits us to offer access to policy documents directly to policyholders in 2010. We intend to focus on nonrevenue bearing services that allow our agencies to concentrate on more important services and sales. In early 2009 the convenience of paying premiums online or over the phone was introduced to our directly-billed personal lines policyholders.
Life Insurance Segment The life insurance segment contributed $143million of net earned premiums, representing 3.7percent of total revenues, and $2 million of income before income taxes in 2009. Life insurance segment profitability is discussed in detail in Item 7, LifeInsurance Results of Operations, Page 62. Lifeinsurance net earned premiums grew 13.0percent in 2009, 0.8percent in 2008 and 9.0percent in2007.
The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company supports our agency-centered business model. Cincinnati Life helps meet the needs of our agencies, including increasing and diversifying agency revenues. Weprimarily focus on life products that produce revenue growth through a steady stream of premium payments. Bydiversifying revenue and profitability for both the agency and our company, this strategy enhances the already strong relationship built by the combination of the property casualty and lifecompanies.
Cincinnati Life seeks to become the life insurance carrier of choice for the independent agencies that work with our property casualty operations. We emphasize up-to-date products, responsive underwriting and high quality service as well as competitive commissions. At year-end 2009, almost 85percent of our 1,463property casualty reporting agency locations offered Cincinnati Lifes products to their clients. We also develop life business from approximately 500 other independent life insurance agencies. We are careful to solicit business from these other agencies in a manner that does not conflict with or compete with the marketing and sales efforts of our property casualty agencies.
When marketing through our property casualty agencies, we have specific competitive advantages:  Because       our property casualty operations are held in high regard, property       casualty agency management is predisposed to consider selling our life       products.
Marketing       efforts for both our property casualty and life insurance businesses are       directed by our field marketing department, which assures consistency of       communication and operations. Life field marketing representatives are       available to meet face-to-face with agency personnel and their clients as       well.
The       resources of our life headquarters underwriters and other associates are       available to the agents and field team to assist in the placement of       business. Fewer and fewer of our competitors provide direct, personal       support between the agent and the insurance   carrier.
We continue to emphasize the cross-serving opportunities of our life insurance, including term and worksite products, for the property casualty agencys personal and commercial accounts. In both the property casualty and independent life agency distribution systems, we enjoy the advantages of offering competitive, up-to-date products, providing close personal attention in combination with financial strength and stability.
We       primarily offer products addressing the needs of businesses with key       person and buy-sell coverages. We offer personal and commercial clients of       our agencies quality, personal life insurance   coverage.
Term       insurance is our largest life insurance product line. We continue to       introduce new term products with features our agents indicate are       important, such as a return of premium benefit, and we have restructured       our underwriting classifications to better meet the needs of their       clients.
Because of our strong capital position, we can offer a competitive product portfolio including guaranteed products, giving our agents a marketing edge. Our life insurance company maintains strong insurer financial strength ratings: A.M. Best  A (Excellent), Fitch  A+ (Strong) and Standard & Poor's  A+(Strong), as discussed in Financial Strength, Page 3. Our life insurance company haschosen not to establish a Moodys rating.
Page 16 Life Insurance Business Lines Four lines of business  term insurance, universal life insurance, worksite products and whole life insurance  account for approximately 96.4percent of the life insurance segments revenues:  Term       insurance  policies under which a death benefit is payable only if the       insured dies during a specific period of time. For policies without a       return of premium provision, no benefit is payable if the insured person       survives to the end of the term. For policies in-force with a return of       premium provision, abenefit equal to the sum of all paid premiums is       payable if the insured person survives to the end of the term. While       premiums are fixed, they must be paid as scheduled. The policies are fully       underwritten.
Universal       life insurance  long-duration life insurance policies. Contract premiums       are neither fixed nor guaranteed; however, the contract does specify a       minimum interest crediting rate and a maximum cost of insurance charge and       expense charge. Premiums are not fixed and may be varied by the contract       owner. The cash values, available as a loan collateralized by the cash       surrender value, are not guaranteed and depend on the amount and timing of       actual premium payments and the amount of actual contract assessments. The       policies are fully underwritten.
Worksite       products  term insurance, whole life insurance, universal life and       disability insurance offered to employees through their employer. Premiums       are collected by the employer using payroll deduction. Polices are issued       using a simplified underwriting approach and on a guaranteed issue basis.       Worksite insurance products provide our property casualty agency force       with excellent cross-serving opportunities for both commercial and       personal accounts. Agents report that offering worksite marketing to       employees of their commercial accounts provides a benefit to the employees       at no cost to the employer. Worksite marketing also connects agents with       new customers who may not have previously benefited from receiving the       services of a professional independent     insuranceagent.
Whole       life insurance  policies that provide life insurance for the entire       lifetime of the insured; the death benefit is guaranteed never to decrease       and premiums are guaranteed never to increase. Whilepremiums are       fixed, they must be paid as scheduled. These policies provide guaranteed       cashvalues that are available as loans collateralized by the cash       surrender value. The policies are   fullyunderwritten.
In addition, Cincinnati Life markets:  Disability       income insurance provides monthly benefits to offset the loss of income       when the insured person is unable to work due to accident or       illness.
Deferred       annuities provide regular income payments that commence after the end of a       specified periodor when the annuitant attains a specified age.       During the deferral period, any payments made under the contract       accumulate at the crediting rate declared by the company but not less than       a contract-specified guaranteed minimum interest rate. A deferred annuity       may be surrendered during the deferral period for acash value equal       to the accumulated payments plus interest less the surrender charge, if       any.
Immediate       annuities provide some combination of regular income and lump sum payments       in exchange for a single premium. Immediate annuities also are written by       our life insurance segment and purchased by our property casualty       companies to settle casualty claims.
Page 17 Investment Segment Revenues of the investment segment are primarily from net investment income and from realized investment gains and losses from investment portfolios managed for the holding company and each of the operating subsidiaries. After adding back $69 million in interest credited to contract holders of the life insurance segment, the investment segment contributed $837 million, or 21.5 percent, of our total revenues in 2009. After deducting $69million in interest credited to contract holders of the life insurance segment, the investment segment contributed $768million of income before income taxes.
In 2008, our investment department adopted internal guidelines to place additional parameters around our portfolio, with the approval of the investment committee of the board of directors. These parameters address, among other issues, the overall mix of the portfolio as well as security and sector concentrations. The parameters came out of our risk management program, with the goal of more specifically defining our risk tolerances, aligning our operating plan accordingly and improving managements ability to identify and respond to changing conditions. Going forward, we will evaluate all of our fixed-maturity and equity investments using our investment parameters, as appropriate.
The fair value of our investment portfolio was $10.562 billion and $8.807 billion at year-end2009 and 2008, respectively. The overall portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position as gains harvested from equity rebalancing efforts were more than offset by the strong performance of the bond portfolio.
The cash we generate from insurance operations historically has been invested in three broad categories ofinvestments:  Fixed-maturity       investments  Includes taxable and tax-exempt bonds and redeemable       preferred stocks. During 2009 and 2008, purchases served to offset sales,       calls and market value declines.
Equity       investments  Includes common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. During       2009 and 2008, sales and fair value declines of equity securities more       than offset purchases and fair   valueappreciation.
Short-term       investments  Primarily commercial paper.

We consider internal measures, as well as insurance department regulations and ratings agency guidance. We monitor a variety of metrics, including after-tax yields, the ratio of investments in common stocks to statutory surplus for the property casualty and life insurance operations, and the parent company's ratio of investment assets to total assets.
At year-end 2009, less than 1 percent of the value of our investment portfolio was made up of securities that do not actively trade on a public market and require managements judgment to develop pricing or valuation techniques (Level 3 assets). We generally obtain at least two outside valuations for these assets and generally use the more conservative estimate. These investments include private placements, small issues and various thinly traded securities. See Item 7, Fair Value Measurements, Page 43, and Item 8, Note3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements Page103, for additional discussion of our valuationtechniques.
In addition to securities held in our investment portfolio, at year-end 2009, other invested assets included $40million of life policy loans, $24 million of venture capital fund investments, $6 million of investment in real estate and $11 million of other invested assets.
Fixed-maturity and Short-term Investments By maintaining a well diversified fixed-maturity portfolio, we attempt to manage overall interest rate, reinvestment, credit and liquidity risk. We pursue a buy and hold strategy and do not attempt to make large scale changes to the portfolio in anticipation of rate movements. By investing new money on a regular basis and analyzing risk-adjusted after-tax yields, we work to achieve a laddering effect to our portfolio that may mitigate some of the effects of adverse interest rate movements.
Fixed-maturity and Short-term Portfolio Ratings As of year-end 2009, the portfolio was trading at 104.5 percent of its book value, up from last year as credit spreads tightened considerably.
The portfolio grew significantly in 2009 due to a large volume of purchases. These purchases were most concentrated in the investment grade corporate bond market, particularly in the Baa/BBB ratings range.
Page 18 This hadthe effect of increasing our year-end percentage of investment grade bonds, those rated Baa/BBB or higher, byone percentage point to 92.5 percent. The majority of our non-rated securities are tax-exempt municipal bondsfrom smaller municipalities that chose not to pursue a credit rating. Credit ratings as of December 31 for the fixed-maturity and short-term portfolio were: At       December 31, 2009 At       December 31, 2008 (Dollars       in millions) Fair value Percent to       total Fair value Percent to       total Moody's       Ratings and Standard & Poor's Ratings combined Aaa,       Aa, A, AAA, AA, A $ 4,967 63.2 % $ 4,149 70.2 % Baa,       BBB 2,302 29.3 1,258 21.3 Ba,       BB 279 3.5 240 4.1 B,       B 44 0.6 46 0.8 Caa,       CCC 29 0.4 7 0.1 Ca,       CC 3 0.0 3 0.1 C,       C 0 0.0 0 0.0 Non-rated 237 3.0 208 3.4 Total $ 7,861 100.0 % $ 5,911 100.0 % We discuss the maturity of our fixed-maturity portfolio in Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 100. Attributes of the fixed-maturity portfolio include: Years       ended December 31, 2009 2008 Weighted       average yield-to-book value 5.9 % 5.6 % Weighted       average maturity 7.5 yrs 8.2 yrs Effective       duration 5.3 yrs 5.4 yrs Taxable Fixed Maturities Our taxable fixed-maturity portfolio (at fair value) at year-end 2009 included:  $347       million in U.S. agency paper that is rated Aaa/AAA by Moodys and Standard       & Poors, respectively.
$3.978       billion in investment-grade corporate bonds that have a Moody's rating at       or above Baa3 or a Standard& Poor's rating at or above       BBB-.
$309       million in high-yield corporate bonds that have a Moody's rating below       Baa3 or a Standard & Poor's rating below   BBB-.
$137       million in taxable municipal bonds that have an average rating of Aa3/AA       by Moodys and Standard & Poors,   respectively.
$92       million in convertible bonds and redeemable preferred     stocks.
While our strategy typically is to buy and hold fixed-maturity investments to maturity, we monitor credit profiles and fair value movements when determining holding periods for individual securities. With the exception of U.S. agency paper (government-sponsored entities), noindividual issuer's securities accounted for more than 1.3percent of the taxable fixed-maturity portfolio at year-end2009.
The investment-grade corporate bond portfolio is most heavily concentrated in the financial-related sectors, including banks, brokerage, finance and investment and insurance companies. The financial sectors represented 25.3 percent of fair value of this portfolio at year-end 2009, compared with 30.7percent, atyear-end 2008. Although the financial-related sectors make up our largest group of investment-grade corporate bonds, we believe our concentration is below the average for the corporate bond market as a whole. Energy and utilities are the only other sectors that exceed 10 percent of our investment-grade corporate bond portfolio, at 11.9 and 10.4 percent of fair value respectively at yearend 2009.
Tax-exempt Fixed Maturities We traditionally have purchased municipal bonds focusing on general obligation and essential services, such as sewer, water or others. While no single municipal issuer accounted for more than 0.6percent of the tax-exempt municipal bond portfolio at year-end 2009, there are higher concentrations within individual states. Holdings in Texas and Indiana accounted for a total of 31.9percent of the municipal bond portfolio at year-end 2009.
At year-end 2009, bonds representing $2.295 billion, or 76.7 percent, of the fair value of our municipal portfolio were insured with an average rating of AAA. Because of our emphasis on general obligation and essential services bonds, over 90 percent of the insured municipal bonds have an underlying rating of at least A3or A-.
Short-term Investments Our short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper, demand notes or bonds purchased within oneyear of maturity. We make short-term investments primarily with funds to be used to make upcoming cash payments, such as taxes. At year-end 2009, we had $6 million of short-term investments compared with $84million at year-end 2008.
Page 19 Equity Investments After covering both our intermediate and long-range insurance obligations with fixed-maturity investments, wehistorically used available cash flow to invest in equity securities. Investment in equity securities has playedanimportant role in achieving our portfolio objectives and has contributed to portfolio appreciation. Weremaincommitted to our long-term equity focus, which we believe is key to our companys long-term growth andstability.
At December 31, 2009, two holdings had a fair value equal to or greater than 5 percent of our publicly-traded common stock portfolio compared with four similar holdings at year-end 2008. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is our largest single common stock investment, comprising 5.8 percent of the publicly traded common stock portfolio and 1.4 percent of the investment portfolio. The other stock with a fair value greater than 5 percent of our publicly-traded common stock portfolio is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
Common Stocks Our common stock investments generally are dividend-paying securities that vary from those with high current yield to others with lower yields but better growth prospects. Other criteria we evaluate include increasing sales and earnings, proven management and a favorable outlook. We believe our equity investment style is an appropriate long-term strategy after we have purchased fixed-maturity investments to cover our insurance reserves.
In mid-2008, we began applying new investment guidelines that increased portfolio diversification, reducing single issue and sector concentrations. Our year-end 2009 portfolio has been positioned for reduced volatility going forward. We view our diversifying actions to be consistent with our view of prudent risk management. Weexpect to continue to make changes to the portfolio, as deemedappropriate.
Common Stock Portfolio Industry Sector Distribution Percent       of Publicly Traded Common Stock Portfolio At       December 31, 2009 At       December 31, 2008 Cincinnati Financial S&P       500 Industry Weightings Cincinnati Financial S&P       500 Industry Weightings Sector: Healthcare 18.0 % 12.6 % 21.6 % 14.8 % Consumer       staples 15.5 11.4 19.8 12.8 Energy 11.0 11.5 16.8 13.3 Information       technology 11.0 19.8 4.2 15.3 Financial 10.2 14.4 12.4 13.3 Consumer       discretionary 9.6 9.6 6.6 8.4 Industrials 9.2 10.2 6.1 11.1 Utilities 6.7 3.7 9.3 4.2 Materials 5.1 3.6 1.9 3.0 Telecomm       services 3.7 3.2 1.3 3.8 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % At year-end 2009, 26.2percent of our common stock holdings (measured by fair value) were held at theparent company level. For the publicly-traded common stock portfolio on a consolidated basis, no single issue accounted for more than 5.8percent at year-end 2009. Until June2008, we had held more than 10 percent of Fifth Thirds common stock for many years, and it represented over 25 percent of our common stock holdings as recently as December 31, 2007.
Preferred Stocks We evaluate preferred stocks in a manner similar to the evaluation we make for fixed-maturity investments, seeking attractive relative yields. We generally focus on investment-grade preferred stocks issued by companies that have a strong history of paying common dividends, providing us with another layer of protection. When possible, we seek out preferred stocks that offer a dividend received deduction for income tax purposes. Events in the fall of 2008 and into early 2009 led us to reevaluate the riskiness of all preferred securities, particularly those of banking institutions. As a result, we downsized this portfolio by $82 million of fair value to $93 million.
Additional information regarding the composition of investments is included in Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 100.
Other We report as Other the other income of our standard market property casualty insurance subsidiary, as well as non-investment operations of the parent company and its subsidiary CFCInvestment Company. Beginning 2008, we also included results of our excess and surplus lines operations, The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company and CSUProducer Resources.
Page 20 CFC Investment Company CFC Investment Company offers commercial leasing and financing services to our agents, their clientsand other customers. Asofyear-end 2009, CFC Investment Company had 2,286 accounts and $76million in receivables, compared with 2,197 accounts and $71million in receivables at year-end2008.
Excess and Surplus Lines Property Casualty Insurance Agencies have access to The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Companys product line through CSUProducer Resources, the wholly owned insurance brokerage subsidiary of parent-company Cincinnati Financial Corporation. CSU Producer Resources has binding authority on all classes of business written through CSU and maintains appropriate agent and excess and surplus lines licenses to process non-admitted business.
Agents can submit risks to CSU Producer Resources, reflecting the mix of accounts Cincinnati agencies currently write in their non-admitted excess and surplus lines markets. CSU Producer Resources currently markets and underwrites commercial general liability, property, excess liability and miscellaneous errors and omissions coverages in 37states.
Agency producers have direct access through CSU Producer Resources to a group of our underwriters who focus exclusively on excess and surplus lines business. Those underwriters can tap into their agencies broader Cincinnati relationships to bring their policyholders services such as experienced and responsive loss control and claims handling. Our excess and surplus lines policy administration system delivers electronic copies of policies to producers within minutes of underwriting approval and policy issue. CSU Producer Resources gives extra support to our producers by remitting excess and surplus lines taxes and stamping fees and retaining admitted market affidavits, whererequired.
Regulation The business of insurance primarily is regulated by state law. All of our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Ohio, except The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, which is domiciled in the State of Delaware. Each insurance subsidiary is governed by the insurance laws and regulations in its respective state of domicile. We also are subject to state regulatory authorities of all states in which we write insurance. The state laws and regulations that have the most significant effect on our insurance operations and financial reporting are discussed below.
Insurance       Holding Company Regulation  We are regulated as an insurance holding       company system in the respective states of domicile of our standard market       property casualty company subsidiary and its surplus lines and life       insurance subsidiaries. These regulations require that we annually furnish       financial and other information about the operations of the individual       companies within the holding company system. All transactions within a       holding company affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to       the state insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of       transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and prior to       certain material transactions between an insurer and any person or entity       in its holding company group. Inaddition, some of those transactions       cannot be consummated without the commissioners       priorapproval.
Subsidiary       Dividends  The Cincinnati Insurance Company is 100percent owned by       Cincinnati Financial Corporation. The dividend-paying capacity of The       Cincinnati Insurance Company and its 100 percent owned subsidiaries is       regulated by the laws of the applicable state of domicile. Under these       laws, our insurance subsidiaries must provide a 10-day advance       informational notice to the insurance commissioner for the domiciliary       state prior to payment of any dividend or distribution to its       shareholders. In all cases, ordinary dividends may be paid only from       earned surplus, which for the Ohio subsidiaries is the amount of       unassigned funds set forth in an insurance subsidiarys most recent       statutory financial statement. For the Delaware subsidiary, it is the       amount of available and accumulated funds derived from the subsidiarys       net operating profit of its business and realized capital       gains.
The insurance company subsidiaries must give 30 days notice to and obtain prior approval from the state insurance commissioner before the payment of an extraordinary dividend as defined by the states insurance code. You can find information about the dividends paid by our insurance subsidiary in 2009 in Item8, Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 106.
Insurance       Operations  All of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to licensing       and supervision by departments of insurance in the states in which they do       business. The nature and extent of such regulations vary, but generally       have their source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and       administrative powers to state insurance departments. Such regulations,       supervision and administration of the insurance subsidiaries include,       among others, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained;       the licensing of insurers and their agents and brokers; the nature and       limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of       policyholders; regulation of policy forms and premium rates; policy       cancellations and non-renewals; periodic examination of the affairs of       insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the       financial condition of Page 21 insurers       or for other purposes; requirements regarding reserves for unearned       premiums, losses and other matters; the nature of and limitations on       dividends to policyholders and shareholders; the nature and extent of       required participation in insurance guaranty funds; the involuntary       assumption of hard-to-place or high-risk insurance business, primarily       workers compensation insurance; and the collection, remittance and       reporting of certain taxes and fees.
The legislative and regulatory climate in Florida continues to create uncertainty for the insurance industry. In February 2007, we adopted a marketing stance of continuing to service existing accounts while writing no new business relationships in Florida. This remained our stance through 2009, except in the lines of directors and officers, surety, machinery and equipment and life insurance, which we resumed writing in June 2007, subject to existing guidelines. In2009, we cautiously resumed writing additional commercial lines new business, while working to more actively manage the associated catastrophe risk, carefully underwriting new commercial submissions and non-renewing commercial and personal lines policies that present the most risk of loss because of their age, construction and geographic characteristics. In 2009, our property casualty written premiums from Florida agencies were 2.3 percent of net written premiums, compared with 2.9 percent in 2008.
On August 24, 2007, the company received administrative subpoenas from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation seeking documents and testimony concerning insurance for residential risks located in Florida and communications with reinsurers, risk modeling companies, rating agencies and insurance trade associations. We produced documents to respond to the subpoenas. The Office of Insurance Regulation canceled and has not rescheduled the hearing noticed in the subpoena for October 18, 2007. Although inactive, these subpoenas remain outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Wecontinue to assess the changing insurance environment in Florida and hope to resume writing our complete portfolio of insurance products in the state as the marketstabilizes.
Insurance       Guaranty Associations  Each state has insurance guaranty association laws       under which the associations may assess life and property casualty       insurers doing business in the state for certain obligations of insolvent       insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states       assess each member insurer in an amount related to the insurers       proportionate share of business written by all member insurers in the       state. Our insurance companies received a savings of less than $2 million       from guaranty associations in 2009 and a charge of less than $1 million in       2008. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments or       refunds on our insurance subsidiaries under     theselaws.
Shared       Market and Joint Underwriting Plans  State insurance regulation requires       insurers to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and       joint underwriting associations, which are mechanisms that generally       provide applicants with various basic insurance coverages when they are       not available in voluntary markets. Such mechanisms are most commonly       instituted for automobile and workers compensation insurance, but many       states also mandate participation in FAIR Plans or Windstorm Plans, which       provide basic property coverages. Participation is based upon the amount       of a companys voluntary market share in a particular state for the       classes of insurance involved. Underwriting results related to these       organizations could be adverse to our company.
Statutory       Accounting  For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial       statements in accordance with GAAP. However, certain data also must be       calculated according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the       NAICs Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (SAP). While not a       substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, statutory data frequently       is used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources to       facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance       companies.
Insurance       Reserves  State insurance laws require that property casualty and life       insurers analyze the adequacy of reserves annually. Our appointed       actuaries must submit an opinion that reserves are adequate for policy       claims-paying obligations and related expenses.
Risk-Based       Capital Requirements  The NAICs risk-based capital       (RBC)requirements for property casualty and life insurers serve as       an early warning tool for the NAIC and state regulators to identify       companies that may be undercapitalized and may merit further regulatory       action. The NAIC has a standard formula for annually assessing RBC. The       formula for calculating RBC for property casualty companies takes into       account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting       factors for reserving and pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for       life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance,       business, asset and interest rate risks.
Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives can affect our business. We do not expect to have any material effects on our expenditures, earnings or competitive position as a result of compliance with any federal, state, or local provisions enacted or regulated relating to the protection of the environment. We currently do not have any material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
Page 22 Item       1A.
Risk       Factors Our business involves various risks and uncertainties that may affect achievement of our business objectives. Many of the risks could have ramifications across our organization. For example, while risks related to setting insurance rates and establishing and adjusting loss reserves are insurance activities, errors in these areas could have an impact on our investment activities, growth and overall results.
The following discussion should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks we face. It is not a definitive summary of their potential impacts or of our strategies to manage and control the risks. Please see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Page 34, for a discussion of those strategies.
The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There are additional risks and uncertainties that we do not believe are material at this time. There also may be risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware. If any risks or uncertainties discussed here develop into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline materially.
Readers should carefully consider this information together with the other information we have provided in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as news releases and other information we disseminate publicly.
We rely exclusively on independent insurance agents to distribute our products.
We market our products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agents. These agents are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors products. We must offer insurance products that meet the needs of these agencies and their clients. We need to maintain good relationships with the agencies that market our products. If we do not, these agencies may market our competitors products instead of ours, which may lead to us having a less desirable mix of business and could affect our results of operations.
Certain events or conditions could diminish our agents desire to produce business for us and the competitive advantage that our independent agencies enjoy:  Downgrade       of the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. We       believe our strong insurer financial strength ratings, in particular the       A+ (Superior) rating from A.M. Best for our standard market property       casualty insurance subsidiaries, are an important competitive advantage.       Ratings agencies could change or expand their requirements. If our       property casualty ratings were to be downgraded, our agents might find it       more difficult to market our products or might choose to emphasize the       products of other carriers. See Item1, Our Business and Our       Strategy, Page 1, for additional discussion of our financial strength       ratings.
Concerns       that doing business with us is difficult or not profitable, perceptions       that our level of service is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in       the marketplace, or perceptions that our business practices are not       compatible with agents business models. These issues could occur if       agents or policyholders believe that we are no longer providing the       prompt, reliable personal service that has long been a distinguishing       characteristic of our insurance operations.
Delays       in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology       projects and enhancements or independent agent perceptions that our       technology solutions are inadequate to match     theirneeds.
A reduction in the number of independent agencies marketing our products, the failure of agencies to successfully market our products, changes in the strategy or operations of agencies or the choice of agencies to reduce their writings of our products could affect our results of operations if we were unable to replace them with agencies that produce adequate and profitable premiums.
Further, policyholders may choose a competitors product rather than our own because of real or perceived differences in price, terms and conditions, coverage or service. If the quality of the independent agencies with which we do business were to decline, that also might cause policyholders to purchase their insurance through different agencies or channels. Consumers, especially in the personal insurance segments, may increasingly choose to purchase insurance from distribution channels other than independent insurance agents, such as directmarketers.
We could experience an unusually high level of losses due to catastrophic, pandemic or terrorism events or risk concentrations.
In the normal course of our business, we provide coverage against perils for which estimates of losses are highly uncertain, in particular catastrophic and terrorism events. Catastrophes can be caused by a number of events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires. Due to the nature of these events, we are unable to predict precisely the frequency or potential cost of catastrophe occurrences. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our ability Page 23 to appropriately manage catastrophe risk depends partially on catastrophe models, the accuracy of which may be affected by inaccurate or incomplete data, the uncertainty of the frequency and severity of future events and the uncertain impact of climate change.
The geographic regions in which we market insurance are exposed to numerous natural catastrophes, suchas:  Hurricanes       in the gulf, eastern and southeastern coastal   regions.
Earthquakes       in the New Madrid fault zone, which lies within the central Mississippi       valley, extending from northeast Arkansas through southeast Missouri,       western Tennessee and western Kentucky to southern Illinois, southern       Indiana and parts of Ohio.
Tornado,       wind and hail in the Midwest, South, Southeast, Southwest and the       mid-Atlantic.
The occurrence of terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. While we do insure terrorism risk in all areas we serve, we have identified our major terrorism exposure as general commercial risks in the metropolitan Chicago area, small co-op utilities, small shopping malls and small colleges throughout our 37 active states, and, because of the number of associates located there, our Fairfield headquarters. Additionally, our life insurance subsidiary could be adversely affected in the event of a terrorist event or an epidemic such as the avian or swine flu, particularly if the epidemic were to affect a broad range of the population beyond just the very young or the very old. Our associate health plan is self-funded and could similarly be affected.
Our results of operations would be adversely affected if the level of losses we experience over a period of time were to exceed our actuarially determined expectations. In addition, our financial condition would be adversely affected if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity or at unfavorable prices to pay an unusually high level of loss and loss expenses. Securities pricing might be even less favorable if a number of insurance companies needed to sell securities during a short period of time because of unusually high losses from catastrophic events.
Our geographic concentration ties our performance to business, economic, environmental and regulatory conditions in certain states. We market our property casualty insurance products in 37 states, but our business is concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast. We also have exposure in states where we do not actively market insurance when clients of our independent agencies have businesses or properties in multiple states.
The Cincinnati Insurance Company also participates in three assumed reinsurance treaties with two reinsurers that spread the risk of very high catastrophe losses among many insurers. In 2009, the largest treaty had exposure of up to $7million of assumed losses in three layers, from $1.0 billion to $1.7 billion, from a single event under an assumed reinsurance treaty for Munich Re Group.
In the event of a severe catastrophic event or terrorist attack elsewhere in the world, our insurance losses may be immaterial. However, the companies in which we invest might be severely affected, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our reinsurers might experience significant losses, potentially jeopardizing their ability to pay losses we cede to them. We also may be exposed to state guaranty fund assessments if other carriers in a state cannot meet their obligations to policyholders. A catastrophe or epidemic event also could affect our operations by damaging our headquarters facility, injuring associates and visitors at our Fairfield, Ohio, headquarters or disrupting our associates ability to perform their assigned tasks.
Our ability to achieve our performance objectives could be affected by changes in the financial, credit and capital markets or the general economy.
We invest premiums received from policyholders and other available cash to generate investment income and capital appreciation, maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay covered claims and operating expenses, service our debt obligations and pay dividends.
Investment income is an important component of our revenues and net income. The ability to increase investment income and generate longer-term growth in book value is affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions, changes in laws and regulations, terrorism attacks or threats, adverse events affecting other companies in our industry or the industries in which we invest, market events leading to credit constriction and other widespread unpredictable events. These events may adversely affect the economy generally and could cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease. A significant decline in our investment income could have an adverse effect on our net income, and thereby on our shareholders equity and our policyholders surplus. For more detailed discussion of risks associated with our investments, please refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 82.
We issue life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to as bank-owned life insurance contracts (BOLIs). BOLI investment assets must meet certain criteria established by the regulatory authorities in which jurisdiction the group contract holder is subject. Therefore, sales of investments may be mandated to maintain compliance with these regulations, possibly requiring gains or losses to be recorded.
Page 24 We could experience losses if the assets in the accounts were less than liabilities at the time of maturity or termination. We discuss other risks associated with our separate account BOLIs in Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Separate Accounts, Page 45.
Deterioration in the banking sector or in banks with which we have relationships could affect our results of operations. Our ability to maintain or obtain short-term lines of credit could be affected if the banks from which we obtain these lines are purchased, fail or are otherwise negatively affected. We may lose premium if a bank that owns appointed agencies were to change its strategies. We could experience increased losses in our director and officer liability line of business if claims were made against insured financialinstitutions.
Our investment performance also could suffer because of the types of investments, industry groups and/or individual securities in which we choose to invest. Market value changes related to these choices could cause a material change in our financial condition or results of operations.
At year-end 2009, common stock holdings made up 24.5 percent of our invested assets. Adverse news or events affecting the global or U.S. economy or the equity markets could affect our net income, book value and overall results as well as our ability to pay our common stock dividend. See Item 7, Investments Results of Operations, Page 64, and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Page 82, fordiscussion of our investment activities.
Deteriorating credit and market conditions could also impair our ability to access credit markets and could affect existing or future lending arrangements.
Our overall results could be affected if a significant portion of our commercial lines policyholders, including those purchasing surety bonds, are adversely affected by marked or prolonged economic downturns and events such as a downturn in construction and related sectors, tightening credit markets and higher fuel costs. Such events could make it more difficult for policyholders to finance new projects, complete projects or expand their businesses, leading to lower premiums from reduced payrolls and sales and lower purchases of equipment and vehicles. These events could also cause claims, including surety claims, to increase due to a policyholders inability to secure necessary financing to complete projects or to collect on underlying lines of credit in the claims process. Such economic downturns and events could have a greater impact in the construction sector where we have a concentration of risks and in geographic areas that are hardest hit by economic downturns.
Deteriorating economic conditions could also increase the degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents who collect premiums for payment to us and could hamper our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.
Our ability to properly underwrite and price risks and increased competition could adversely affect our results.
Our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. We establish our pricing based on assumptions about the level of losses that may occur within classes of business, geographic regions and other criteria.
To properly price our products, we must collect and properly analyze data; the data must be sufficient, reliable and accessible; we need to develop appropriate rating methodologies and formulae; and we may need to identify and respond to trends quickly. Inflation trends, especially outside of historical norms, may make itmore difficult to determine adequate pricing. If rates are not accurate, we may not generate enough premiums to offset losses and expenses or we may not be competitive in the marketplace.
Our ability to set appropriate rates could be hampered if a state or states where we write business refuses to allow rate increases that we believe are necessary to cover the risks insured. At least one state requires us to purchase reinsurance from a mandatory reinsurance fund. Such reinsurance funds can create a credit risk for insurers if not adequately funded by the state and, in some cases, the existence of a reinsurance fund could affect the prices charged for our policies. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business.
The insurance industry is cyclical and intensely competitive. From time to time, the insurance industry goes through prolonged periods of intense competition during which it is more difficult to attract new business, retainexisting business and maintain profitability. Competition in our insurance business is based on many factors,including:  Competitiveness       of premiums charged  Relationships       among carriers, agents, brokers and   policyholders  Underwriting       and pricing methodologies that allow insurers to identify and flexibly       price risks  Compensation       provided to agents  Underwriting       discipline  Terms       and conditions of insurance coverage  Speed       at which products are brought to market Page 25  Product       and marketing innovations, including advertising  Technological       competence and innovation  Ability       to control expenses  Adequacy       of financial strength ratings by independent ratings agencies such as A.M.       Best  Quality       of services provided to agents and policyholders  Claims       satisfaction and reputation If our pricing were incorrect or we were unable to compete effectively because of one or more of these factors, our premium writings could decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adverselyaffected.
Please see the discussion of our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Life Insurance Segments in Item 1, Page 12, Page15 and Page 16, for a discussion of our competitive position in the insurancemarketplace.
Our loss reserves, our largest liability, are based on estimates and could be inadequate to cover our actual losses.
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared using GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For a discussion of the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements and the material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item8, Note1of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 94, and Item7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves and Life Insurance Policy Reserves, Page 38 and Page 42.
Our most critical accounting estimate is loss reserves. Loss reserves are the amounts we expect to pay for covered claims and expenses we incur to settle those claims. The loss reserves we establish in our financial statements represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims arising from insured events that have already occurred, including events that have not yet been reported to us. Lossreserves are estimates and are inherently uncertain; they do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability. Inflationary scenarios, especially scenarios outside of historical norms, may make itmore difficult to estimate loss reserves. Accordingly, our loss reserves for past periods could prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and related expenses. Anychanges in these estimates are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which the changes are made. An increase inour loss reserves would decrease earnings, while a decrease in our loss reserves would increaseearnings.
The estimation process for unpaid loss and loss expense obligations involves uncertainty by its very nature. We continually review the estimates and adjust the reserves as facts about individual claims develop, additional losses are reported and new information becomes known. Adjustments due to loss development on prior periods are reflected in the calendar year in which they are identified. The process used to determine our loss reserves is discussed in Item7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves and Life Insurance Policy Reserves, Page 38 and Page 42.
Unforeseen losses, the type and magnitude of which we cannot predict, may emerge in the future. Theseadditional losses could arise from changes in the legal environment, laws and regulations, climate change, catastrophic events, increases in loss severity or frequency, or other causes. Such future losses could be substantial.
Our ability to obtain or collect on our reinsurance protection could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We buy property casualty and life reinsurance coverage to mitigate the liquidity risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. If we were unable to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms and in appropriate amounts, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
In addition, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Although we purchase reinsurance to manage our risks and exposures to losses, this reinsurance does not discharge our direct obligations under the policies we write. We would remain liable to our policyholders even if we were unable to recover what we believe we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts. Reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. For long-tail claims, the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. A reinsurers insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with our insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Page 26 We participated in USAIG, a joint underwriting association of individual insurance companies that collectively functions as a worldwide insurance market for all types of aviation and aerospace accounts. Our participation was terminated after policy year 2002. Atyear-end 2009, 31percent, or $212 million, of our total reinsurance receivables were related to USAIG, primarily for events of September 11, 2001, offset by $221 million of amounts ceded to other pool participants and reinsurers. If the pool participants and reinsurers were unable to fulfill their financial obligations and all security collateral that supports the participants obligations became worthless, we could be liable for an additional pool liability of $288million and our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected. Currently all pool participants and reinsurers are financially solvent.
Please see Item 7, 2010Reinsurance Programs, Page 79, for a discussion of our reinsurance treaties.
Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions.
Our business depends on our associates ability to perform necessary business functions, such as processing new and renewal policies and claims. We increasingly rely on technology and systems to accomplish these business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. Our inability to access our headquarters facilities or a failure of technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis or affect the accuracy of transactions. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption or system failure could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, serve our agents and policyholders, pay claims in a timely manner, collect receivables or perform other necessary business functions. If our disaster recovery and business continuity plans did not sufficiently consider, address or reverse the circumstances of an interruption or failure, this could result in a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. This risk is exacerbated because approximately 70percent of our associates work at our Fairfield, Ohio, headquarters.
The effects of changes in industry practices and regulations on our business are uncertain.
As industry practices and legal, judicial, legislative, regulatory, political, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance pricing, claims and coverage, may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by impeding our ability to obtain adequate rates for covered risks, extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, unforeseeable emerging and latent claim and coverage issues may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance policies that could be affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.
Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), state insurance regulators and statelegislators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations governing insurance companies and insurance holding companies, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws, regulations relating to product forms and pricing methodologies and the development of new laws and regulations that affect a variety of financial and nonfinancial components ofour business. Any proposed or future legislation, regulation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in highercosts.
Federal laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted in the wake of the financial and credit crises, may have adverse affects on our business, potentially including a change from a state-based system of regulation to a system of federal regulation, the repeal of the McCarran Ferguson Act and/or the establishment of an insurance office in Department of Treasury. While we do not participate or intend to seek to participate in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the effect of it or any similar legislation on our industry, particularly competition from insurers that do participate, and the economy in general isuncertain.
The effects of such changes could adversely affect our results of operations. Please see Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves and Life Insurance Policy Reserves, Page38 and Page 42, for a discussion of our reserving practices.
Page 27 Managing technology initiatives and meeting new data security requirements are significant challenges.
While technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives present short-term cost, implementation and operational risks. In addition, we may have inaccurate expense projections, implementation schedules or expectations regarding the effectiveness and user acceptance of the end product. These issues could escalate over time. If we were unable to find and retain employees with key technical knowledge, our ability to develop and deploy key technology solutions could be hampered.
We necessarily collect, use and hold data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a relationship. Threats to data security rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to rising costs and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. A breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage.
Please see Item 1, Strategic Initiatives, Page 8 for a discussion of our technology initiatives.
Our status as an insurance holding company with no direct operations could affect our ability to pay dividends in the future.
Cincinnati Financial Corporation is a holding company that transacts substantially all of its business throughits subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the stock in our operating subsidiaries and our investments.Consequently, our cash flow to pay cash dividends and interest on our long-term debt depends on dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries and income earned on investments held at the parent-company level.
Dividends paid to our parent company by our insurance subsidiary are restricted by the insurance laws of Ohio, its domiciliary state. These laws establish minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds and limits. Currently, the maximum dividend that may be paid without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of 10percent of statutory surplus or 100 percent of statutory net income for the prior calendar year, up to the amount of statutory unassigned surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year. Dividends exceeding these limitations may be paid only with prior approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance. Consequently, at times, we might not be able to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiary, or we might not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock without liquidating securities. This could affect our financial position.
Please see Item 1, Regulation, Page 21, and Item 8, Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page106, for discussion of insurance holding company dividend regulations.

Theboard of directors has authorized share repurchases since 1996. Purchases are expected to be made generally Page 30 through open market transactions. The board gives management discretion to purchaseshares at reasonable prices in light of circumstances at the time of purchase, subject to SECregulations.
On October 24, 2007, the board of directors expanded the existing repurchase authorization to approximately 13million shares. The prior repurchase program for 10 million shares was announced in 2005, replacing a program that had been in effect since 1999. No repurchase program has expired during the period covered by the above table. All of the publicly announced plan repurchases in the table above were made under the expansion announced in October 2007 of our 2005 program. Neither the 2005 nor 1999 program had an expiration date, but no further repurchases will occur under the 1999program.

Management's       Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of       Operations Introduction The purpose of Managements Discussion and Analysis is to provide an understanding of Cincinnati Financial Corporations consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Our Managements Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data, Pages 32 and33, and Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, beginning on Page 87. We present per share data on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted, adjusting those amounts for all stock splits and stock dividends.
We begin with an executive summary of our results of operations and outlook, as well as details on criticalaccounting policies and estimates. Periodically, we refer to estimated industry data so that we can give information on our performance within the context of the overall insurance industry. Unless otherwisenoted, the industry data is prepared by A.M.Best, a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and financial strength rating organization. Information from A.M. Best is presented on a statutorybasis. Whenwe provide our results on a comparable statutory basis, we label it as such; all othercompany dataispresented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of America (GAAP).
Executive Summary Through The Cincinnati Insurance Company, Cincinnati Financial Corporation is one of the 25largest property casualty insurers in the nation, based on written premium volume for approximately 2,000 U.S. stock and mutual insurer groups. We market our insurance products through a select group of independent insurance agencies in 37states as discussed in Item 1, Our Business and Our Strategy, Page 1.
Although 2009 and 2008 were difficult years for our economy, our industry and our company, our long-term perspective lets us address the immediate challenges while focusing on the major decisions that best position the company for success through all market cycles. We believe that this forward-looking view has consistently benefited our shareholders, agents, policyholders and associates.
To measure our progress, we have defined a measure of value creation that we believe captures the contribution of our insurance operations, the success of our investment strategy and the importance weplace on paying cash dividends to shareholders. We refer to this measure as our value creation ratio, orVCR, and it is made up of two primary components: (1) our rate of growth in book value per share plus(2)the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. For the period 2010through 2014, an annual value creation ratio averaging 12 percent to 15 percent is our primary performance target. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is a useful supplement to GAAP information. With heightened economic and marketuncertainty since 2008, we believe the long-term nature of this ratio is an appropriate way to measure our long-term progress in creating shareholder value.
One Three-year Five-year year % average % average Value       creation ratio as       of December 31, 2009 19.7 % (3.2 )       % 1.7 % as       of December 31, 2008 (23.5 ) (4.2 ) (1.3 ) as       of December 31, 2007 (5.7 ) 4.1 6.3 When looking at our longer-term objectives, we see three performance drivers:  Premium       growth  We believe over any five-year period our agency relationships and       initiatives canlead to a property casualty written premium growth       rate that exceeds the industry average. Thecompound annual growth       rate of our net written premiums was negative 0.6 percent over the       five-year period 2005 through 2009, equal to the negative 0.6 percent       estimated growth rate for the property casualty insurance       industry.
Combined       ratio  We believe our underwriting philosophy and initiatives can       generate a GAAP combined ratio over any five-year period that is       consistently below 100 percent. Our GAAP combined ratio has averaged       95.6percent over the five-year period 2005 through 2009. Our       combined ratio was below 100 percent in each year during the period,       except 2008 and 2009, which averaged 102.5percent, and which       averaged catastrophe losses that were 2.5 percentage points higher than       the average for the 10-year period prior to 2008. Performance as measured       by the combined ratio is discussed in Consolidated Property Casualty       Insurance Results of Operations, Page 46. Our statutory combined ratio       averaged 95.4 percent over the five-year period 2005 through       2009compared with an estimated 98.9 percent for the property       casualty industry.
Page 34  Investment       contribution - We believe our investment philosophy and initiatives can       drive investment income growth and lead to a total return on our equity       investment portfolio over a five-year period that exceeds the five-year       return of the Standard & Poors 500 Index.
o Investment       income growth, on a before-tax basis, grew at a compound annual rate of       0.3percent over the five-year period 2005 through 2009. It grew in       each year except 2008 and 2009, when weexperienced a dramatic       reduction in dividend payouts by financial services companies held in our       equity portfolio, a risk we addressed aggressively during 2008, completing       that effort in early2009.
o Over       the five years ended December 31, 2009, our compound annual equity       portfolio return was a negative 5.8 percent compared with a compound       annual total return of 0.4 percent for the Index. Our equity portfolio       underperformed the market for the five-year period primarily because of       the decline in the market value of our previously large holdings in the       financial services sector. For the year 2009, our compound annual equity       portfolio return was 16.4 percent, compared with 26.5percent for the       Index, as the broad market rally did not favor the higher quality,       dividend-paying stocks we prefer.
The board of directors is committed to rewarding shareholders directly through cash dividends and through authorizing share repurchases. The board also has periodically declared stock dividends and splits. Through 2009, the company has increased the indicated annual cash dividend rate for 49 consecutive years, a record we believe is matched by only 11 other publicly traded companies. The board regularly evaluates relevant factors in dividend-related decisions, and the increase reflects confidence in our strong capital, liquidity and financial flexibility, as well as progress through our initiatives to improve earnings performance. We discuss our financial position in more detail in Liquidity and Capital Resources, Page 68.
Strategic Initiatives Highlights Management has worked to identify the strategies that can lead to long-term success, with concurrence by the board of directors. Our strategies are intended to position us to compete successfully in the markets we have targeted while appropriately managing risk. We believe successful implementation of the initiatives that support our strategies will help us better serve our agent customers, reduce volatility in our financial results and weather difficult economic, market or industry pricing cycles.
Manage       capital effectively  Continued focus on these initiatives is intended to       manage our capital and liquidity so that we can successfully grow our       insurance business. A strong capital position provides the capacity to       support premium growth and provides the liquidity to pay claims while       sustaining our investment in the people and infrastructure needed to       implement our other strategic initiatives.
Improve       insurance profitability  Implementation of these operational initiatives       is intended to support profitable growth for the agencies that represent       us and for our company. These initiatives seek to enhance our underwriting       or pricing expertise and to provide more advanced technology to our       agents, allowing them to serve clients faster and manage expenses better.       Some initiatives also streamline our internal processes so we can devote       more resources to agent service.
Drive       premium growth  Implementation of these operational initiatives is       intended to expand our geographic footprint and diversify our premium       sources to obtain profitable growth without significant infrastructure       expense. Diversified growth also may reduce our catastrophe       exposurerisk.
We discuss each of these strategies, along with the metrics we use to assess their progress, in Item 1, Strategic Initiatives, Page 8, Factors Influencing Our Future Performance In 2009, our value creation ratio result exceeded our target annual average of 12 percent to 15 percent for the period 2010 through 2014, and in 2008, it was below our target, as discussed in the review of our financial highlights below. For the year 2010, we believe our value creation ratio may be below our long-term target for several reasons.
The       strong rally in financial markets during 2009 had a highly favorable       impact on our 2009 value creation ratio, offsetting much of the       unfavorable impact of the sharp decline in financial markets during 2008.       That decline also was reflected in the value creation ratio. Should       financial markets decline during 2010, which could occur as part of       typical volatility patterns, the related component of our 2010 value       creation ratio could also register a weak or negative     result.
Lingering       effects of soft insurance market pricing are expected to affect growth       rates and earned premium levels into 2010 and perhaps later, depending on       when insurance market conditions improve. These conditions continue to       weaken loss ratios and hamper near-term profitability. Economic factors,       including inflation, may increase our claims and settlement expenses       related to medical care, litigation and   construction.
The       weak economy is expected to continue to affect policyholders by deflating       the valuation of their business and personal insurable assets. Until the       weak economy significantly strengthens, we do not expect to see       significant premium growth for the property casualty industry or our       commercial lines Page 35 segment, which represented 75 percent of our 2009 property casualty net written premiums. Property casualty written premium growth also may lag as our growth initiatives need more time to reach their full contribution.
We       will incur the cost of continued investment in our business, including       technology, entry in new states and process initiatives to create       long-term value. In addition, we will not see the full advantage of many       of these investments for several years.
Diversification       of the investment portfolio during 2008 and early 2009 included sales of       selected positions to lock in gains, reduce concentrations and increase       liquidity. Proceeds of sales were reinvested in both fixed income and in       equity securities with yields that we believe are likely to be more       secure, but which could result in slower growth of investment income. We       expect to continue making changes to the portfolio, as       appropriate.
Our view of the value we can create over the next five years relies on two assumptions about the external environment. First, we anticipate some firming of commercial insurance pricing by the end of 2010. Second, we believe that the economy and financial markets can resume a growth track by the end of 2010. If those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may not be able to achieve our performance targets even if we accomplish our strategic objectives.
Other factors that could influence our ability to achieve our targets include:  We       expect the insurance marketplace to remain competitive, which is likely to       cause carriers to pursuestrategies that they believe could lead to       economies of scale, market share gains or the potential for an improved       competitive posture. Direct writers will continue to be a factor in the       personalinsurance market.
We       expect the independent insurance agency system to remain strong and       viable, with continued agency consolidation, especially as agency margins       come under more pressure due to soft pricing and the difficult economic       environment. The soft commercial market that has extended into 2010       creates additional risk for agencies. We expect the soft market to       continue for much of 2010, particularly in non-catastrophe-event-prone       states and lines of business, absent a significant event or       events.
We       expect initiatives that make it easier for agents to do business with us       will continue to be a significant factor in agency relationships, with       technology being a major driver. Policyholders will increasingly demand       online services and access from agents or   carriers.
We discuss in our Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 23, many potential risks to our business and our ability to achieve our qualitative and quantitative objectives. These are real risks, but their probability of occurring may not be high. We also believe that our risk management programs generally could mitigate their potential effects, in the event they would occur. We continue to study emerging risks, including climate change risk and its potential financial effects on our results of operation and those we insure. These effects include deterioration in credit quality of our municipal or corporate bond portfolios and increased losses without sufficient corresponding increases in premiums. As with any risk, we seek to identify the extent of the risk exposure and possible actions to mitigate potential negative effects of risk, at an enterprise level.
We have formal risk management programs overseen by a senior officer andsupported bya team of representatives frombusiness areas.The team makes reports toour chairman, our president and chief executive officer and our board of directors, as appropriate,on risk assessments, risk metrics and risk plans. Our use of operational audits, strategic plans and departmental business plans, as well as our culture of open communications and our fundamental respect for our Code of Conduct, continue to help us manage risks on an ongoing basis.
Below we review highlights of our financial results for the past three years. Detailed discussion of these topics appears in Results of Operations, Page 46, and Liquidity and Capital Resources, Page 68.
Corporate Financial Highlights The value creation ratio discussed in the Executive Summary, Page 34, was 19.7 percent in 2009, negative 23.5percent in 2008 and negative 5.7percent in 2007. The book value per share growth component of the value creation ratio was 13.6 percent during 2009, largely reflecting improved valuation of our investment portfolio in addition to earnings. In both 2008 and 2007, a decline in unrealized gains on our investment portfolio was the most significant factor in the decline in book value as discussed below. In 2009 and 2008, net income also was significantly below the level of 2007.
Cash dividends declared per share rose 0.6 percent in 2009, 9.9 percent in 2008 and 6.0 percent in2007.

Entering 2009, the portfolio was substantially more diversified and generally better positioned to withstand short-term fluctuations compared with recent years. The downturn in the economy during 2008 had a particularly adverse effect on our financial sector equity holdings, which made up a significant portion of the portfolio prior to mid-2008. We discuss our investment strategy in Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 18, and results for the segment in Investment Results of Operations, Page 64.
Our ratio of debt to total capital (debt plus shareholders equity) decreased during 2009 after rising in 2008. The increase during 2008 was due to the effect on shareholders equity from the declining value of our invested assets.

Net income declined in 2008 because of a decline in realized investment gains, a first-ever decline in investment income and a lower aggregate contribution from our insurance segments. A 2008 pension plansettlement reduced 2008 net income by $17million, or 11 cents per share. The transition from a defined benefit pension plan reduced company risk while providing a company-sponsored 401(k) match toassociates.
Weighted average shares outstanding may fluctuate from period to period due to repurchases of shares under board authorizations or issuance of shares when associates exercise stock options. Weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis declined by less than 1 million in 2009, after declining 9 million in 2008 and 3million in 2007.
As discussed in Investment Results of Operation, Page 64, security sales led to realized investment gains in all three years, although 2008 gains were tempered by $510 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges. Realized investment gains and losses are integral to our financial results over the long term. We have substantial discretion in the timing of investment sales and, therefore, the gains or losses that are recognized in any period. That discretion generally is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, applicable accounting standards require us to recognize gains and losses from certain changes in fair values of securities and for securities with embedded derivatives without actual realization of those gains and losses.
Lower income from common stock dividends led to a 6.8 percent decline in pretax net investment income in 2009, improving on an 11.6 percent decline for 2008, which was the first decline for this measure in company history. The primary reason for the decline was dividend reductions by common and preferred holdings, including reductions during the year on positions subsequently sold or reduced.

In both 2009 and 2008, our property casualty insurance operations reported an underwriting loss after achieving record profitability in 2007. We measure property casualty underwriting profitability primarily by the combined ratio. Our combined ratio measures the percentage of each earned premium dollar spent onclaims plus all expenses related to our property casualty operations. A lower ratio indicates more favorable results and better underlying performance. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, favorable development on reserves for claims that occurred in prior accident years helped offset incurred loss and loss expenses. Reserve development is discussed further in Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Obligations and Reserves, Pages 71 through 72. Catastrophe losses fluctuated dramatically over the three-year period, withhigher than average contributions to the combined ratio of 5.7 and 6.8 percentage points in 2009and 2008, respectively, following an unusually low 0.8 points in 2007. Our 10-year historical annual average contribution of catastrophe losses to the combined ratio was 4.2 percentage points as of December31,2009. The pension plan settlement increased the 2008 combined ratio by 0.8percentagepoints.
During 2009, our excess and surplus lines operations contributed $39 million to net written premiums and $27 million to earned premiums. We began excess and surplus lines operations in 2008, and performance is consistent with expectations, including a modest underwriting loss primarily due to start-up expenses related to technology for processing business.
Our life insurance segment continued to provide a consistent source of profit. We discuss results for the segment in Life Insurance Results of Operations, Page 62. Investment income and realized investment gains from the life insurance investment portfolio are included in Investments segment results.
Critical Accounting Estimates Cincinnati Financial Corporations financial statements are prepared using GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are discussed in Item8, Note1of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 94. In conjunction with that discussion, material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying the companys critical accounting policies are discussed below. The audit committee of the board of directors reviews the annual financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. These discussions cover the quality of earnings, review of reserves and accruals, reconsideration of the suitability of accounting principles, review of highly judgmental areas including critical accounting policies, audit adjustments and such other inquiries as may beappropriate.
Property Casualty Insurance Loss And Loss Expense Reserves We establish loss and loss expense reserves for our property casualty insurance business as balance sheet liabilities. These reserves account for unpaid loss and loss expenses as of a financial statement date. Unpaid loss and loss expenses are the estimated amounts necessary to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, as of that date.
For some lines of business that we write, a considerable and uncertain amount of time can elapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of insured claims. The amount we will actually have to pay for such claims also can be highly uncertain. This uncertainty, together with the size of our reserves, makes the loss and loss expense reserves our most significant estimate. Gross loss and loss expense reserves were $4.096billion at year-end 2009 compared with $4.040 billion at year-end2008.
How Reserves Are Established Our field claims representatives establish case reserves when claims are reported to the company to provide for our unpaid loss and loss expense obligation associated with individual claims. Experienced Page 38 headquarters claims supervisors review individual case reserves greater than $35,000 that were established by field claims representatives. Headquarters claims managers also review case reserves greater than $100,000.
Our claims representatives base their case reserve estimates primarily upon case-by-case evaluations that consider:  type       of claim involved  circumstances       surrounding each claim  policy       provisions pertaining to each claim  potential       for subrogation or salvage recoverable  general       insurance reserving practices Case reserves of all sizes are subject to review on a 90-day cycle, or more frequently if new information about a loss becomes available. As part of the review process, we monitor industry trends, cost trends, relevant court cases, legislative activity and other current events in an effort to ascertain new or additional loss exposures.
We also establish incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves to provide for all unpaid loss and loss expenses not accounted for by case reserves:  For       weather events designated as catastrophes, we calculate IBNR reserves       directly as a result of an estimated IBNR claim count and an estimated       average claim amount for each event. Our claims department management       coordinates the assessment of these events and prepares the related IBNR       reserve estimates. Such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of       the nature of the storm, of policyholder exposures within the affected       geographic area and of available claims intelligence. Depending on the       nature of the event, available claims intelligence could include surveys       of field claims associates within the affected geographic area, feedback       from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area, as well as data on       claims reported as of the financial statement date. We generally use the       catastrophe definition provided by Property Claims Service, a division of       Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCSdefines a catastrophe as an       event that causes countrywide damageof $25 million or more in       insured property losses and affects a significant number of policyholders       and insureds.
For       asbestos and environmental claims, we calculate IBNR reserves by deriving       an actuarially based estimate of total unpaid loss and loss expenses. We       then reduce the estimate by total case reserves. Wediscuss the       reserve analysis that applies to asbestos and environmental reserves in       Asbestos and Environmental Reserves, Page 74.
For       all other claims and events, IBNR reserves are calculated as the       difference between an actuarial estimate of the ultimate cost of total       loss and loss expenses incurred reduced by the sum of total loss and loss       expense payments and total case reserves estimated for individual claims.       We discuss below the development of actuarially based estimates of the       ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses   incurred.
Our actuarial staff applies significant judgment in selecting models and estimating model parameters when preparing reserve analyses. Inaddition, unpaid loss and loss expenses are inherently uncertain as to timing and amount. Uncertainties relating to model appropriateness, parameter estimates and actual loss and loss expense amounts are referred to as model, parameter and process uncertainty, respectively. Our management and actuarial staff control for these uncertainties in the reserving process in a variety of ways.
Our actuarial staff bases its IBNR reserve estimates for these losses primarily on the indications of methods and models that analyze accident year data. Accident year is the year in which an insured claim, loss, or loss expense occurred. The specific methods and models that our actuaries have used for the past several years are:  paid       and reported loss development methods  paid       and reported loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods  individual       and multiple probabilistic trend family models Our actuarial staff uses diagnostics provided by stochastic reserving software to evaluate the appropriateness of the models and methods listed above. The softwares diagnostics have indicated that the appropriateness of these models and methods for estimating IBNR reserves for our lines of business tends to depend on a line's tail. Tail refers to the time interval between a typical claim's occurrence and its settlement. For our long-tail lines such as workers compensation and commercial casualty, models from the probabilistic trend family tend to provide superior fits and to validate well compared with models underlying the loss development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. The loss development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, particularly the reported loss variations, tend to produce the more appropriate IBNR reserve estimates for our short-tail lines such as homeowner and commercial property. For our mid-tail lines such as personal and commercial auto liability, all models and methods provide usefulinsights.
Page 39 Our actuarial staff also devotes significant time and effort to the estimation of model and method parameters. The loss development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods require the estimation of numerous loss development factors. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods also involve the estimation of numerous ultimate loss ratios by accident year. Models from the probabilistic trend family require the estimation of development trends, calendar year inflation trends and exposure levels. Consequently, our actuarial staff monitors a number of trends and measures to gain key business insights necessary for exercising appropriate judgment when estimating the parameters mentioned.
These trends and measures include:  company       and industry pricing  company       and industry exposure  company       and industry loss frequency and severity  past       large loss events such as hurricanes  company       and industry premium  company       in-force policy count These trends and measures also support the estimation of ultimate accident year loss ratios needed forapplying the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and for assessing the reasonability of all IBNR reserve estimates computed. Our actuarial staff reviews these trends and measures quarterly, updating parameters derived from them asnecessary.
Quarterly, our actuarial staff summarizes its reserve analysis by preparing an actuarial best estimate and a range of reasonable IBNR reserves intended to reflect the uncertainty of the estimate. An inter-departmental committee that includes our actuarial management team reviews the results of each quarterly reserve analysis. The committee establishes managements best estimate of IBNR reserves, which is the amount that is included in each periods financial statements. In addition to the information provided by actuarial staff, the committee also considers factors such as the following:  large       loss activity and trends in large losses  new       business activity  judicial       decisions  general       economic trends such as inflation  trends       in litigiousness and legal expenses  product       and underwriting changes  changes       in claims practices The determination of management's best estimate, like the preparation of the reserve analysis that supports it, involves considerable judgment. Changes in reserving data or the trends and factors that influence reserving data may signal fundamental shifts or may simply reflect single-period anomalies. Even if a change reflects a fundamental shift, the full extent of the change may not become evident until years later. Moreover, since our methods and models do not explicitly relate many of the factors we consider directly to reserve levels, we typically cannot quantify the precise impact of such factors on the adequacy of reserves prospectively or retrospectively.
Due to the uncertainties described above, our ultimate loss experience could prove better or worse than our carried reserves reflect. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and increased, the amount of the increase is a charge in the period that the deficiency is recognized, raising our loss and loss expense ratio and reducing earnings. To the extent that reserves are redundant and released, the amount of the release is a credit in the period that the redundancy is recognized, reducing our loss and loss expense ratio and increasing earnings.
Key Assumptions - Loss Reserving Our actuarial staff makes a number of key assumptions when using their methods and models to derive IBNR reserve estimates. Appropriate reliance on these key assumptions essentially entails determinations of the likelihood that statistically significant patterns in historical data may extend into the future. The four most significant of the key assumptions used by our actuarial staff and approved by management are:  Emergence       of loss and allocated loss expenses on an accident year basis. Historical       paid loss, reportedloss and paid allocated loss expense data for the       business lines we analyze contain patternsthat reflect how unpaid       losses, unreported losses and unpaid allocated loss expenses as of a       financial statement date will emerge in the future on an accident year       basis. Unless our actuarial staff or management identifies reasons or       factors that invalidate the extension of historical patterns into       thefuture, these patterns can be used to make projections necessary       for estimating IBNR reserves. Ouractuaries significantly rely on       this assumption in the application of all methods and models       mentionedabove.
Page 40  Calendar       year inflation. For long-tail and mid-tail business lines, calendar year       inflation trends for futurepaid losses and paid allocated loss       expenses will not vary significantly from a stable, long-term average. Our       actuaries base reserve estimates derived from probabilistic trend family       models on thisassumption.
Exposure       levels. Historical earned premiums, when adjusted to reflect common levels       of product pricing and loss cost inflation, can serve as a proxy for       historical exposures. Our actuaries require this assumption to estimate       expected loss ratios and expected allocated loss expense ratios used by       the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserving methods. They also use this assumption       to establish exposure levels for recent accident years, characterized by       green or immature data, when working with probabilistic trend family       models.
Claims       having atypical emergence patterns. Characteristics of certain subsets of       claims, such as high frequency, high severity, or mass tort claims, have       the potential to distort patterns contained in historical paid loss,       reported loss and paid allocated loss expense data. When testing indicates       this to be the case for a particular subset of claims, our actuaries       segregate these claims from the data and analyze them separately. Subsets       of claims that could fall into this category include hurricane claims,       individual large claims and asbestos and environmental     claims.
These key assumptions have not changed since 2005, when our actuarial staff began using probabilistic trend family models to estimate IBNR reserves.
Paid losses, reported losses and paid allocated loss expenses are subject to random as well as systematic influences. As a result, actual paid losses, reported losses and paid allocated loss expenses are virtually certain to differ from projections. Such differences are consistent with what specific models for our business lines predict and with the related patterns in the historical data used to develop these models. As a result, management does not closely monitor statistically insignificant differences between actual and projected data.
Reserve Estimate Variability Management believes that the standard error of a reserve estimate, a measure of the estimate's variability, provides the most appropriate measure of the estimate's sensitivity. The reserves we establish depend on the models we use and the related parameters we estimate in the course of conducting reserve analyses. However, the actual amount required to settle all outstanding insured claims, including IBNR claims, as of a financial statement date depends on stochastic, or random, elements as well as the systematic elements captured by our models and estimated model parameters. For the lines of business we write, process uncertainty  the inherent variability of loss and loss expense payments  typically contributes more to the imprecision of a reserve estimate than parameter uncertainty.
Consequently, a sensitivity measure that ignores process uncertainty would provide an incomplete pictureof the reserve estimate's sensitivity. Since a reserve estimate's standard error accounts for both processand parameter uncertainty, it reflects the estimate's full sensitivity to a range of reasonably likelyscenarios.
The table below provides standard errors and reserve ranges for lines of business that account for just over 90percent of our 2009 loss and loss expense reserves as well as the potential effects on our net income, assuming a 35percent federal tax rate. Standard errors and reserve ranges for assorted groupings of these lines of business cannot be computed by simply adding the standard errors and reserve ranges of the component lines of business, since such an approach would ignore the effects of product diversification. See Range of Reasonable Reserves, Page 72, for more details on our total reserve range. While the table reflects our assessment of the most likely range within which each line's actual unpaid loss and loss expenses may fall, one or more lines' actual unpaid loss and loss expenses could nonetheless fall outside of the indicated ranges.

To date, our cash flow has covered our loss and loss expense payments, and we have never had to sell investments to make these payments. If this were to become necessary, however, our fixed maturity investments should provide us with ample liquidity. At year-end 2009, consolidated fixed maturity investments exceeded total insurance reserves (including life policy reserves) by more than $1.930 billion.
Life Insurance Policy Reserves We establish the reserves for traditional life insurance policies based on expected expenses, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a provision for uncertainty. Once these assumptions are established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. We use both our own experience and industry experience adjusted for historical trends in arriving at our assumptions for expected mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates. We use our own experience and historical trends for setting our assumptions for expected expenses. We base our assumptions for expected investment income on our own experience adjusted for current economic conditions.
We establish reserves for our universal life, deferred annuity and investment contracts equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. Some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. For these policies, we establish a reserve in addition to the account balance based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.
Asset Impairment Our fixed-maturity and equity investment portfolios are our largest assets. The companys asset impairment committee continually monitors the holdings in these portfolios and all other assets for signs of other-than-temporary or permanent impairment. The committee monitors significant decreases in the fair value of invested assets, changes in legal factors or in the business climate, an accumulation of costs in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset, uncollectability of all receivable assets, or other factors such as bankruptcy, deterioration of creditworthiness, failure to pay interest or dividends or signs indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The application of our impairment policy resulted in other-than-temporary impairment charges that reduced our income before income taxes by $131 million in 2009, $510 million in 2008 and $16 million in 2007. Impairment charges are recorded for other-than-temporary declines in value, if, in the asset impairment committees judgment, there is little expectation that the value may be recouped within a designated recovery period. Other than-temporary impairment losses represent non-cash charges toincome and are reported as realized investment losses.
Our portfolio managers monitor their assigned portfolios. If a security is trading below book value, the portfolio managers undertake additional reviews. Such declines often occur in conjunction with events taking place in the overall economy and market, combined with events specific to the industry or operations of the issuing organization. Management reviews quantitative measurements such as a declining trend in fair value, the extent of the fair value decline and the length of time the value of the security has been depressed, as well as qualitative measures such as pending events, credit ratings and issuer liquidity. We are even more proactive when these declines in valuation are greater than might be anticipated when viewed in the context of overall economic and market conditions. We provide information Page 42 about valuation of our invested assets in Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page100.
All securities valued below 100 percent of book value are reported to the asset impairment committee for evaluation. Securities valued between 95 percent and 100 percent of book value are reviewed but not monitored separately by the committee. These assets generally are at this value because of interest rate-driven factors.
When evaluating for other-than-temporary impairments, the committee considers the companys intent and ability to retain a security for a period adequate to recover its cost. Because of the company's financial strength, management may not impair certain securities even when they are trading below book value.
When determining OTTI charges for our fixed-maturity portfolio, management places significant emphasis on whether issuers of debt are current on contractual payments and whether future contractual amounts are likely to be paid. Our fixed maturity invested asset impairment policy states that OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if we intend to sell the impaired fixed maturity security; (2) if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell, the book value of any such securities is reduced to fair value as the new cost basis, and a realized loss is recorded in the quarter in which it is recognized. When we believe that full collection of interest and/or principal is not likely, we determine the net present value of future cash flows by using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition as the discount rate and compare that amount to the amortized cost and fair value of the security. The difference between the net present value of the expected future cash flows and amortized cost of the security is considered a credit loss and recognized as a realized loss in the quarter in which it occurred. The difference between the fair value and the net present value of the cash flows of the security, the non-credit loss, is recognized in other comprehensive income as an unrealizedloss.
When determining OTTI charges for our equity portfolio, our invested asset impairment policy considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including facts and circumstances specific to individual securities, asset classes, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in dividend payment, the length of time fair value had been less than book value, the severity of the decline in fair value below book value, the volatility of the security and our ability and intent to hold each position until its forecasted recovery.
For each of our equity securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2009, we applied the objective quantitative and qualitative criteria of our invested asset impairment policy for OTTI. Our long-term equity investment philosophy, emphasizing companies with strong indications of paying and growing dividends, combined with our strong surplus, liquidity and cash flow, provide us the ability to hold these investments through what we believe to be slightly longer recovery periods occasioned by the recession and historic levels of market volatility. We review the expected recovery period by individual security. Based on the individual qualitative and quantitative factors, as discussed above, we evaluate and determine an expected recovery period for each security. A change in the condition of a security can warrant impairment before the expected recovery period. If the security has not recovered cost within the expected recovery period, the security is impaired.
Securities that have previously been impaired are evaluated based on their adjusted book value and written down further, if deemed appropriate. We provide detailed information about securities trading in a continuous loss position at year-end 2009 in Item 7A, Application of Asset Impairment Policy, Page85. Another-than-temporary decline in the fair value of a security is recognized in net income as a realized investment loss.
Securities considered to have a temporary decline would be expected to recover their book value, which may be at maturity. Under the same accounting treatment as fair value gains, temporary declines (changes in the fair value of these securities) are reflected in shareholders equity on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and have no impact on net income.
Fair Value Measurements Valuation of Financial Instruments Valuation of financial instruments, primarily securities held in our investment portfolio, is a critical component of our year-end financial statement preparation. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, ASC820-10, defines fair value as the exit price or the amount that would be (1) received to sell an asset or (2)paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. When determining an exit price, we must, whenever possible, rely upon observable market data. Prior to the adoption of ASC 820-10, we considered various factors such as liquidity and volatility but primarily obtained pricing from various external services, including broker quotes.
The fair value measurement and disclosure exit price notion requires our valuation also to consider what a marketplace participant would pay to buy an asset or receive to assume a liability. Therefore, while we can Page 43 consider pricing data from outside services, we ultimately determine whether the data or inputs used by these outside services are observable or unobservable.
In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have categorized our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as described in Item 8, Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, Page103.
Level 1 and Level 2 Valuation Techniques Over 99 percent of the $10.562 billion of securities in our investment portfolio measured at fair value areclassified as Level 1 or Level 2. Financial assets that fall within Level 1 and Level 2 are priced according to observable data from identical or similar securities that have traded in the marketplace. Also within Level2 are securities that are valued by outside services or brokers where we have evaluated the pricing methodology and determined that the inputs are observable.
Included in the Level 2 hierarchy is a small portfolio of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) that represented less than 1 percent of the fair value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2009. We obtained the CMOs as part of the termination of our securities lending program during 2008.
Level 3 Valuation Techniques Financial assets that fall within the Level 3 hierarchy are valued based upon unobservable market inputs, normally because they are not actively traded on a public market. Level 3 corporate fixed-maturity securities include certain private placements, small issues, general corporate bonds and medium-term notes. Level3state, municipal and political subdivisions fixed-maturity securities include various thinly traded municipal bonds. Level 3 common equities include private equity securities. Level 3 preferred equities include private and thinly traded preferredsecurities.
Pricing for each Level 3 security is based upon inputs that are market driven, including third-party reviews provided to the issuer or broker quotes. However, we placed in the Level 3 hierarchy securities for which we were unable to obtain the pricing methodology or we could not consider the price provided as binding. Pricingfor securities classified as Level 3 could not be corroborated by similar securities priced using observable inputs.
Management ultimately determined the pricing for each Level 3 security that we considered to be the bestexit price valuation. As of December 31, 2009, total Level 3 assets were less than 1 percent of our investment portfolio measured at fair value. Broker quotes are obtained for thinly traded securities that subsequently fall within the Level3hierarchy. We obtained two non-binding quotes from brokers and, after evaluating, our investment professionals typically selected the lower quote as the fairvalue.
Employee Benefit Pension Plan We have a defined benefit pension plan which was modified during 2008; refer to Item 8, Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 109, for additional information. Contributions and pension costs are developed from annual actuarial valuations. These valuations involve key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated annually. Any adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current market conditions. Therefore, changes in the related pension costs or credits may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions.
Key assumptions used in developing the 2009 net pension obligation were a 6.10 percent discount rate and rates ofcompensation increases ranging from 4.00 percent to 6.00 percent. Key assumptions used in developing the 2009 net pension expense were a 6.00 percent discount rate, an 8.00 percent expected return on plan assets and rates of compensation increases ranging from 4.00 percent to 6.00 percent. See Note 13, Page 109 for additional information onassumptions.
In 2009, the net pension expense was $11 million. In 2010, we expect the net pension expense to be $12million.
Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5 percentage-point change in the discount rate would affect our 2010income before income taxes by $1 million. Likewise, a 0.5 percentage point change in the expected return on plan assets would affect our 2010 income before income taxes by $1 million.
The fair value of the plan assets was $42 million less than the accumulated benefit obligation at year-end 2009 and $52million less at year-end 2008. The fair value of the plan assets was $77 million less than the projected plan benefit obligation at year-end 2009 and $88 million less at year-end 2008. Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of the pension plan. In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $25million to our qualified plan.
Page 44 Deferred Acquisition Costs We establish a deferred asset for costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, acquiring property casualty and life insurance business. These costs are principally agent commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting costs, which are deferred and amortized into net income as premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs track with the change in premiums. Underlying assumptions are updated periodically to reflect actual experience. Changes in the amounts or timing of estimated future profits could result in adjustments to the accumulated amortization of these costs.
For property casualty policies, deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the terms of the policies. We assess recoverability of deferred acquisition costs at the segment level, consistent with the ways we acquire service, manage and measure profitability. Our standard market insurance operations consist of two segments, commercial lines and personal lines. We also have deferred acquisition costs in our excess and surplus lines operation, which is reported in Other. For life policies, acquisition costs are amortized into income either over the premium-paying period of the policies or the life of the policy, depending on the policy type. We analyze our acquisition cost assumptions periodically to reflect actual experience; we evaluate our deferred acquisition cost for recoverability; and we regularly conduct reviews for potential premium deficiencies or loss recognition.
Contingent Commission Accrual Another significant estimate relates to our accrual for property casualty contingent (profit-sharing) commissions. We base the contingent commission accrual estimate on property casualty underwriting results and on supplemental information. Contingent commissions are paid to agencies using a formula that takes into account agency profitability, premium volume and other factors, such as prompt monthly payment of amounts due to the company. Due to the complexity of the calculation and the variety of factors that can affect contingent commissions for an individual agency, the amount accrued can differ from the actual contingent commissions paid. The contingent commission accrual of $81million in 2009contributed 2.8percentage points to the property casualty combined ratio. If contingent commissions paid were to vary from that amount by 5percent, it would affect 2010 net income by $3 million (after tax), or 2centsper share, and the combined ratio by approximately 0.1percentage points.
Separate Accounts We issue life contracts referred to as bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI). Based on the specific contract provisions, the assets and liabilities for some BOLIs are legally segregated and recorded as assets and liabilities of the separate accounts. Other BOLIs are included in the general account. For separate account BOLIs, minimum investment returns and account values are guaranteed by the company and also include death benefits to beneficiaries of the contract holders.
Separate account assets are carried at fair value. Separate account liabilities primarily represent the contract holders' claims to the related assets and are carried at an amount equal to the contract holders account value. Generally, investment income and realized investment gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contract holders and, therefore, are not included in our Consolidated Statements of Income. However, each separate account contract includes a negotiated realized gain and loss sharing arrangement with the company. Thisshare is transferred from the separate account to our general account and is recognized as revenue or expense. In the event that the asset value of contract holders accounts is projected below the value guaranteed by the company, a liability is established through a charge to our earnings.
For our most significant separate account, written in 1999, realized gains and losses are retained in the separate account and are deferred and amortized to the contract holder over a five-year period, subject to certain limitations. Upon termination or maturity of this separate account contract, any unamortized deferred gains and/or losses will revert to the general account. In the event this separate account holder were to exchange the contract for the policy of another carrier in 2010, the account holder would not pay a surrender charge. The surrender charge is zero in 2010 and beyond.
Atyear-end 2009, net unamortized realized losses amounted to $7million. In accordance with this separate account agreement, the investment assets must meet certain criteria established by the regulatory authorities to whose jurisdiction the group contract holder is subject. Therefore, sales of investments may be mandated to maintain compliance with these regulations, possibly requiring gains or losses to be recorded and charged to the general account. Potentially, losses could be material; however, unrealized losses are approximately $6million before tax in the separate account portfolio, which had a book value of $541million at year-end 2009.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information about recent accounting pronouncements is provided in Item 8, Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 94. We have determined that recent accounting pronouncements have not had nor are they expected to have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Page 45 Results Of Operations Consolidated financial results primarily reflect the results of our four reporting segments. These segments are defined based on financial information we use to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of assets.
Commercial       lines property casualty insurance  Personal       lines property casualty insurance  Life       insurance  Investments We report as Other the non-investment operations of the parent company and its non-insurer subsidiaries, CFCInvestment Company and CSU Producers Resources Inc. We also report as Other the results of The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, as well as other income of our standard market property casualty insurance subsidiary.
We measure profit or loss for our commercial lines and personal lines property casualty and life insurance segments based upon underwriting results (profit or loss), which represent net earned premium less loss and loss expenses and underwriting expenses on a pretax basis. We also frequently evaluate results for our consolidated property casualty insurance operations, which is the total of our commercial, personal plus our excess and surplus insurance results. Underwriting results and segment pretax operating income are not substitutes for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
For our consolidated property casualty insurance operations as well as the insurance segments, statutory accounting data and ratios are key performance indicators that we use to assess business trends and to make comparisons to industry results, since GAAP-based industry data generally is not as readily available.
Investments held by the parent company and the investment portfolios for the insurance subsidiaries are managed and reported as the investments segment, separate from the underwriting businesses. Net investment income and net realized investment gains and losses for our investment portfolios are discussed in the Investment Results ofOperations.
The calculations of segment data are described in more detail in Item 8, Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 115. The following sections review results of operations for each of the four segments. Commercial Lines Insurance Results of Operations begins on Page 49, Personal Lines Insurance Results of Operations begins on Page 57, LifeInsurance Results of Operations begins on Page 62, and Investment Results of Operations begins on Page 64. We begin with an overview of our consolidated property casualty operations, which is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines plus excess and surplus lines results.
Consolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results Of Operations In addition to the factors discussed in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines Insurance Results of Operations, Page49 and Page 57, overall growth and profitability for our consolidated property casualty insurance operations were affected by a number of common factors. The table below summarizes results of operations for our property casualty operations.
Our 2009 and 2008 combined ratios before catastrophe losses and reserve development on prior accident years were substantially higher than 2007 primarily due to lower pricing prompted by soft market conditions and also due to normal loss cost inflation. During 2008, we also experienced a higher level of larger commercial lines losses and the impact of a pension plan settlement cost. The pension plan settlement increased the 2008 combined ratio by 0.8percentage points. We have taken actions to manageexpenses, increasing spending in some areas such as technology to pursue long-term benefits anddecreasing in other areas of our operation. However, lower pricing continues to put upward pressure on the underwriting expense ratio. This is consistent with industry trends as A.M. Best estimates that the industrys 2009statutory underwriting expense ratio increased by 1.4 percentage points compared with the year 2006level.

New business written directly by agencies rose in both 2009 and 2008 after declining in 2007. The resurgence in new business was largely due to the contribution of new agency appointments  in both new and existing states of operation; the contribution of our excess and surplus lines business; and more competitive personal lines pricing. Other written premiums primarily include premiums ceded to our reinsurers as part of our reinsurance program.

In 2007, catastrophe losses added just 0.8 percentage points, the lowest ratio over the same period. Our 10-year historical annual average contribution of catastrophe losses to the combined ratio was 4.2percentage points as of December 31, 2009. The following table shows catastrophe losses incurred, netof reinsurance, for the past three years, as well as the effect of loss development on prior period catastrophe reserves.
Hurricane Ike, which reached the Gulf Coast on September 12, 2008, moved into the Midwest on September14, causing unusually high winds in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. At December 31, 2009, our gross losses from Hurricane Ike were estimated at $145 million, making it the single largest catastrophe in the companys history. Net of reinsurance, the loss was estimated at $59 million. Virtually all of the losses reported by our policyholders occurred in the Midwest.

Commission expenses include our profit-sharing, or contingent commissions, which are primarily based on the profitability of an agencys aggregate property casualty book of Cincinnati business. The commission ratio has declined from the 2007 level. These profit-based commissions generally fluctuate with our loss and loss expense ratio, with the expense ratio generally increasing when our loss and loss expense ratio declines. The change in our pension plan added 0.5 percentage points to the 2008 non-commission underwriting expense ratio.

Our commercial lines net written       premium decline for 2009 of 5.6 percent compared favorably with the       estimated decline of 7.9 percent for the overall commercial lines       industry, and our 2008decline of 4.2 percent was slightly worse than       the decline of 3.9 percent estimated for the industry. We believe our pace       for new and renewal business in recent years is consistent with our       agents practice of selecting and retaining accounts with manageable risk       characteristics that support the lower prevailing prices. We also believe       our favorable comparison to the industry for 2009 reflects the advantages       we achieve through our field focus, which provides us with quality       intelligence on local market conditions. Our earned premiums declined in       2009 and 2008, following the pattern of our written premiums, after rising       slightly in 2007.
Combined       ratio  Our commercial lines combined ratio rose to 101.6 percent in 2009       from 97.0percent in 2008,following a very strong performance       in 2007. Compared with 2008, results for 2009 reflected approximately half       as much benefit from net favorable reserve development on prior accident       years, accounting for 5.2 percentage points of the 4.6 percentage-point       combined ratio increase. The reduction in the net favorable reserve       development on prior accident years occurred primarily for our commercial       casualty and workers compensation lines of business. Wecontinue to       focus on sound underwriting fundamentals and obtaining adequate premiums       for risks insured by each individual policy. The 2009 and 2008 ratios for       current accident year before catastrophe losses largely reflect loss cost       trends that are outpacing earned premium trends. Approximately $49       million, or 2.1percentage points, of the rise in 2008 accident year       loss and loss expenses was due to refinements made to the allocation of       IBNR reserves by accident year. We discuss factors affecting the combined       ratio and reserve development by line of business   below.
Our commercial lines statutory combined ratio was 101.8percent in 2009 compared with 96.6 percent in 2008and 89.2 percent in 2007. By comparison, the estimated industry commercial lines combined ratio was 101.2 percent in 2009, 107.2percent in 2008 and 95.1 percent in 2007. Industry commercial lines estimates include mortgage and financial guaranty insurers, which saw a surge in claims following the historically high level of mortgage defaults in 2008, driving an unusually high industry combined ratio for 2008.

In this environment, we have been careful to maintain appropriate pricing discipline for both new and renewal business as we emphasize the importance of assessing account quality to our agencies and underwriters. Wecontinue to make case-by-case decisions not to write or renew certain business. We continue to use rate credits to retain renewals of quality business and earn new business, but do so selectively in order to avoid commercial accounts that we believe have insufficient profit margins. Our experience remains that the larger the account, the higher the credits needed to write or retain the account, with variations by geographic region and class of business.
Over the past three years, we continued to focus on seeking and maintaining adequate premium per risk exposure as well as pursuing non-pricing means of enhancing longer-term profitability. Non-pricing means have included deliberate reviews of each risk, terms and conditions and limits of insurance. We continue to adhere to our underwriting guidelines, tore-underwrite books of business with selected agencies and to update policy terms and conditions. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong local presence. Our field marketing representatives meet with local agencies to reaffirm agreements on the extent of the frontline renewal underwriting that agents will perform. Loss control, machinery and equipment and field claims representatives continue to conduct on-site inspections. To assist underwriters, fieldclaims representatives prepare full reports on their first-hand observations of risk quality.
Both renewal and new business reflected the effects of the economic slowdown in many regions, as exposures declined and policyholders became increasingly focused on reducing expenses. For commercial accounts, we typically calculate general liability premiums based on sales or payroll volume, while we calculate workers compensation premiums based on payroll volume. Achange in sales or payroll volume generally indicates a change in demand for a businesss goods or services, as well as a change in its exposure to risk. Policyholders whoexperience sales or payroll volume changes due to economic factors may be purchasers of other types of insurance, such as commercial auto or commercial property, in addition to general liability and workers compensation. Premium levels for these other types of policies generally are not linked directly to sales or payrollvolumes.
In 2009, we estimated that policyholders with a contractor-related ISO general liability code accounted for approximately 34percent of our general liability premiums, which are included in the commercial casualty line of business, and that policyholders with a contractor-related National Council on Compensation Insurance Inc. (NCCI) workers compensation code accounted for approximately 46percent of our workers compensation premiums. The market seeking to insure contractors has been more adversely affected by the economic slowdown than some other markets.
The decline in 2009 agency renewal written premiums was largely driven by pricing and exposure declines while policy retention rates declined slightly. For renewal business, our headquarters underwriters talk regularly with agents. Our field teams are available to assist headquarters underwriters by conducting inspections and holding renewal review meetings with agency staff. These activities can help verify that a commercial account retains the characteristics that caused us to write the business initially. We measure average changes in commercial lines renewal pricing as the rate of change in renewal premium for the newpolicy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for respective policies. For policies renewed during 2009, the typical pricing decline on average was in the low-single-digit range. For larger accounts we typically experienced more significant premium declines and for smaller accounts we sometimes saw little if any premium change at renewal. The 2009 average represented an improvement from the mid-single-digit range average pricing decline experienced in 2008. In addition to pricing pressures, premiums confirmed by audits of policyholder sales and payrolls declined significantly in 2009. Written and earned premiums from audits decreased $38 million and $52million, respectively, for the year 2009 compared with 2008.
For new business, our field associates are frequently in our agents offices helping to judge the quality of each account, emphasizing the Cincinnati value proposition, calling on sales prospects with those agents, carefully evaluating risk exposure and providing their best quotes. In 2009, new business premium growth largely was driven by agencies appointed in recent years, which includes Texas agents appointed since late 2008 when we entered that state. Texas agencies generated new business growth of $11 million during Page 50 2009 while other agencies appointed during 2008 and 2009 contributed $23 million of our new commercial lines business. During 2009 we wrote fewer policies with annual premiums above $100,000, reflecting significant competition for larger accounts as many carriers continued to protect their renewal portfolio of business during the soft pricing environment. Some of our 2009 new business came from accounts that were not new to the agent. We believe these seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that is less familiar to our agent because it was recently obtained from a competing agent. As we appoint new agencies who choose to move accounts to us, we report these accounts as new business to us.
In 2009, other written premiums had less of a downward impact on commercial lines net written premiums than in 2008, primarily due to a lower overall cost for reinsurance and a smaller adjustment for estimated premiums of policies in effect but not yet processed. The adjustment for estimated premiums had an immaterial effect on earned premiums. Higher ceded reinsurance costs were the primary driver of the larger negative effect in 2008, including $5 million for ceded premium to reinstate coverage for our catastrophe reinsurance treaty.
Commercial Lines Insurance Loss and Loss Expenses Loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses.

Catastrophe losses were volatile over the three-year period as discussed in Consolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results of Operations, Page 46. Catastrophe losses added 3.0, 4.6 and 1.1 percentage points to the commercial lines accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
Commercial lines reserve development for prior accident years continued to net to a favorable amount in 2009, although it was less than in 2008, as discussed in Commercial Lines Insurance Segment Reserves, Page75. Accident years 2008 and 2007 for the commercial lines segment have developed favorably, as indicated in the table above.
Trends for commercial lines loss and loss expenses and the related ratios are further analyzed in Commercial Lines of Business Analysis, Pages 52 through 57.

Ouranalysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. We believe the inherent volatility of loss experience for larger policies is greater than that of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor that in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs. In 2007,our retention for our property and casualty working treaties was $4million.
Page 51 In2008, we raised the casualty treaty retention to $5 million and raised it to $6 million effective January1,2009, when we also raised the property treaty retention to $5 million.

Thedecrease in the commission expenses ratio in 2008 reflected a lower level of our profit-sharing, or contingent commissions, which are primarily based on the profitability of an agencys aggregate property casualty book of Cincinnati business.
In 2009, non-commission underwriting expenses declined slightly, but to a lesser extent than earned premiums, causing the non-commission underwriting expense ratio component of the underwriting expense ratio to rise. In 2008, non-commission underwriting expenses rose on declining earned premiums, which also led to unfavorable deferred acquisition expense comparisons. Further, in 2008, the salary cost contribution rose by approximately 0.8percentage points and the change in our pension plan contributed 0.5 percentage points to the ratio. Refinements in the allocation of expenses between our commercial lines and personal lines segments also contributed to minor variations in the non-commission underwriting expenses.
Commercial Lines Insurance Outlook Industrywide commercial lines written premiums are projected to decline approximately 5.6 percent in 2010with the industry combined ratio estimated at 103.7 percent. As discussed in Item 1, Commercial Lines Property Casualty Insurance Segment, Page 12, over the past several years, renewal and new business pricing has come under steadily increasing pressure, reinforcing the need for more flexibility and careful risk selection. Price competition remains intense and shows no signs of abating in the near term.
We intend to continue marketing our products to a broad range of business classes, pricing our products appropriately and taking a package approach. We intend to maintain our underwriting selectivity and carefully manage our rate levels as well as our programs that seek to accurately match exposures with appropriate premiums. We will continue to evaluate each risk individually and to make decisions about rates, the use of three-year commercial policies and other policy conditions on a case-by-case basis, even in lines and classes of business that are under competitive pressure. Nonetheless, we expect commercial lines profitability to remain under pressure in 2010, in part due to small average pricing declines on policies renewed during 2009 for which premiums will be earned during 2010.
In Item 1, Strategic Initiatives, Page 8, we discuss the initiatives we are implementing to achieve our corporate performance objectives. We discuss factors influencing future results of our property casualty insurance operations in the Executive Summary, Page 34.
Commercial Lines of Business Analysis Approximately 95 percent of our commercial lines premiums relate to accounts with coverages from more than one of our business lines. As a result, we believe that the commercial lines segment is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. However, we provide line-of-business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for each line. The accident year loss data provides current estimates of incurred loss and loss expenses and corresponding ratios over the most recent three accident years. Accident year data classifies losses according to the year in which the corresponding loss events occur, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, recorded or paid. For 2009, the only commercial line of business that exhibited significant adverse profitability trends was workers compensation. Most of the profit deterioration in workers compensation was a result of prior accident year reserve development. Asdiscussed below, actions we are taking to improve pricing and reduce loss costs are expected to benefit future profitability trends.

The decline in commercial casualty premiums reflected the intensifying competition in the casualty market. In addition, premiums for this business line reflect economic trends, including changes in underlying exposures, particularly for general liability coverages where the premium amount is heavily influenced by economically-driven measures of risk exposure such as salesvolume.
The calendar year total loss and loss expense ratio increased during 2009 largely because of a lower level, compared with 2008, of favorable development on prior accident year reserves. Factors contributing to the 2008 higher level of favorable prior accident year reserve development included refinements to our IBNR reserve allocation, quarter-to-quarter reductions in actuarial reserve estimates, the introduction of an additional umbrella liability reserving model, sooner-than-expected moderation in the inflation trend of allocated loss expenses and unusual deviations from predictions of reserving methods and models.
The 2009 current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses deteriorated slightly, reflecting lower pricing per exposure and normal loss cost inflation.

Net written premiums for 2009 increased slightly, largely due to more reinsurance ceded premium in 2008, including $4 million to reinstate coverage for ourcatastrophe reinsurance treaty. The overall declining trend in premium since 2007 also reflected pricingdeclines.
Page 53 The calendar year loss and loss expense ratio improved compared with 2008, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. The 2008 ratio was also adversely affected by 3.4 percentage points for new losses and case reserve increases greater than $250,000. Development on prior period reserves was relatively stable for all periods shown.
The 2009 current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses also improved compared with 2008. A portion of the higher 2008 ratio was due to a higher loss expense allocation because of the level of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. In addition, the refinement in the allocation of IBNR reserves by accident year accounted for approximately 2percentage points of the difference between the 2007 and 2008 ratios.

Commercial auto is one of the business lines that we renew and price annually, so market trends may be reflected here more quickly than in other lines. Commercial auto also experiences pricing pressure because it often represents the largest portion of insurance costs for many commercial policyholders.
The calendar year loss and loss expense ratio improved during 2009 due in part to a higher amount of favorable development on prior accident year reserves. The 2009 accident year loss and loss expense ratio also improved, reflecting more favorable loss experience due in part to the general slump in U.S. economic activity and also reflecting volatility in the number of commercial auto losses greater than $1million.

In addition, premiums resulting from audits of policyholder payroll levels declined $28 million, reflecting the weak economy.
Since we pay a lower commission rate on workers compensation business, this line has a higher calendar year loss and loss expense breakeven point than our other commercial business lines. Nonetheless, the ratio was at an unprofitable level in each of the last three years, and management continues to work to improve financial performance for this line. During 2009, we began using a predictive modeling tool to improve risk selection and pricing capabilities. Predictive modeling increases pricing precision so that our agents can better compete for the most desirable workers compensation business. We also added to our staff of loss control field representatives, premium audit field representatives and field claims representatives specializing in workers compensation risks. In early 2010, we implemented direct reporting of workers compensation claims, allowing us to quickly obtain detailed information to promptly assign the appropriate level of claims handling expertise for each case. Obtaining more information sooner for specific claims allows for medical care appropriate to the nature of each injury, benefiting injured workers, employers and agents while ultimately lowering overall loss costs.
The workers compensation business line includes our longest tail exposures, making initial estimates of accident year loss and loss expenses incurred more uncertain. Due to the lengthy payout period of workers compensation claims, small shifts in medical cost inflation and payout periods could have a significant effect on our potential future liability compared with our current projections. Our workers compensation reserve analyses completed during the first half of 2009 indicated that loss cost inflation was higher than previously estimated, leading us to make more conservative assumptions about future loss cost inflation when estimating loss reserves, thereby significantly increasing losses incurred. Prior analyses attributed a larger share of the rise in claim payments for recent accident years to exposure growth rather than loss cost inflation. However, declining claim frequencies reflected in reserving data as of December 31, 2008, indicated that exposure growth was less of a source of the rise in claim payments for recent accident years than was loss cost inflation. The higher estimates of loss cost inflation derived from analyses during 2009affected reserves estimated for many prior accident years. Accident years 2006 through 2008 had net favorable development of $4 million, largely due to favorable development on the loss expense component of the reserves. Accident years 2000 through 2005 had net unfavorable development of $37million, and accident years prior to 2000 had net unfavorable development of $15 million. Workers compensation prior accident year reserve development for full-year 2009 was unfavorable by $48million for all prior accident years in total compared with favorable development of $2million for 2008. As discussed in Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, including the table on Page 42 showing ranges for estimated reserves, the significant strengthening of reserves during 2009 moved the carried reserves for workers compensation into the upper half of the range.

Page 55 The calendar year and accident year loss and loss expense ratios reflected the volatility in catastrophe losses over the three-year period. In addition, pricing reductions and normal loss cost inflation continued to put upward pressure on the ratios.

Prior to the credit crisis in 2008, this line of business had been growing in response to our marketing of these products.
Director and officer liability coverage accounted for 60.3 percent of surety and executive risk premiums in 2009 compared with 58.9 percent in 2008 and 62.3 percent in 2007. We have actively managed the potentially high risk of writing director and officer liability by:  Marketing       primarily to nonprofit organizations, which accounted for approximately 70       percent of the director and officer liability policies we wrote in       2009.
Limiting       the number of for-profit policies. At year-end 2009, our in-force director       and officer liability policies provided coverage to 14non-financial       publicly traded companies, including two Fortune 1000 companies. We also       provided this coverage to approximately 500 banks, savings and loans and       other financial institutions.
o The       majority of these financial institution policyholders are smaller       community banks, and we believe they have no unusual exposure to       credit-market concerns, including subprime mortgages. Based on new policy       data or information from the most recent policy renewal, only 14of       our bank and savings and loan policyholders have assets greater than       $2billion, only 22 have assets between $1 billion and $2 billion;       and 41 have assets between $500million and       $1billion.
Writing       on a claims-made basis, which normally restricts coverage to losses       reported during the policy term.
Providing       limits no higher than $10million with facultative or treaty       reinsurance in place in 2010 to cover losses greater than       $6million.
The calendar year and current accident year loss and loss expense ratios rose substantially in 2008 and remained high in 2009, driven by director and officer new losses and case reserve increases greater than $250,000. During 2009, there were 37 new director and officer losses and case reserve increases, compared with 38 in 2008 and 20 in 2007. This added approximately $36 million to loss and loss expenses compared with $43 million in 2008 and $9 million in 2007. The higher level in both 2009 and 2008 was largely from claims related to prior lending practices at financial institutions. To address the potential risk inherent in the financial institutions book of our surety and executive risk business line moving forward, we continue to work with our agents to limit the number of new director and officer policies for financial institutions, in addition to using credit rating and other metrics to carefully re-underwrite in-force policies when they are considered for renewal.

Net written premiums grew       slightly, driven by new business growth that included expansion into new       states where we previously offered only commercial lines policies.       Industry average written premium growth was estimated at negative       1.1percent in 2009 and negative 0.7 percent in 2008 after being flat       in 2007.
Combined       ratio  The combined ratio improved slightly in 2009, reflecting in part       improved pricing, following substantial deterioration in 2008. The level       of catastrophe losses remained high in 2009, and the current accident year       loss and loss expense ratio remained fairly steady, once refinements made       to the IBNR reserve allocation in 2008, noted below, are taken into       account. In 2008, the current accident Page 57 year       loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses also rose       substantially, in part due to approximately $20 million, or       2.9percentage points, from refinements made to the allocation of       IBNR reserves by accident year.
Our personal lines statutory combined ratio was 111.4 percent in 2009, 111.6 percent in 2008 and 94.7 percent in 2007. By comparison, the estimated industry personal lines combined ratio was 101.0percent in 2009, 103.6percent in 2008 and 96.1percent in 2007. Our concentration of business in areas hard-hit by catastrophe events contributed to recent results that differed from the overall industry, an issue we are addressing in part through geographic expansion as noted below. The contribution of catastrophe losses to our personal lines statutory combined ratio was 16.1 percentage points in 2009, 14.5 percent points in 2008 and 1.3 percentage points in 2007, compared to an estimated 4.5, 7.5, and 2.1 percentage points, respectively, for the industry.

We believe agents recommend Cincinnati personal insurance products for their value-oriented clients who seek to balance quality and price and who are attracted by our superior claims service and the benefits of our package approach.
Our personal lines policy retention and new business levels have remained at higher levels following introduction in recent years of a limited program of policy credits for personal auto and homeowner pricing in most of the states in which we operate. The program provided credits for eligible new and renewal policyholders identified as above-average quality risks. Additional pricing and credit changes were implemented in early 2009, further improving pricing for the best accounts, which should help us retain and attract even more of our agents preferred business.
Our personal lines new business written by our agencies rose significantly in 2009 as the number of agency locations writing our personal lines rose by 133, or 14.4 percent, following an increase of 136 agency locations in 2008. Since early 2008, we have worked to improve our geographic diversification by expanding our personal lines operation to several states less prone to catastrophes. There are seven states where we began writing business or significantly expanded our personal lines product offerings and automation capabilities beginning in 2008, and they accounted for $13 million of our 2009 increase in our personal lines new business written premiums. Those seven states are Arizona, Idaho, Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah.
For the three-year period, other written premiums, primarily premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and that lower our net written premiums, remained relatively stable. Additional premiums ceded to reinsurers to reinstate our catastrophe reinsurance treaty contributed $9 million to other written premiums in2008.
Personal Lines Insurance Loss and Loss Expenses Loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. Catastrophe losses were unusually high during 2009 and 2008, and also are inherently volatile, as discussed above and in Consolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results of Operations, Page 46. Development on loss and loss expense reserves for prior accident years continued to trend favorably in 2009 as discussed in Personal Lines Insurance Segment Reserves, Page 77.
The increase in the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses since 2007reflects the pricing factors discussed above, normal loss cost inflation and higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. During 2009, one unusually large fire loss for our homeowner line of business contributed $5 million to personal lines segment losses. In addition, refinements made to the allocation of IBNR reserves by accident year increased the 2008 ratio.

The decrease in the commission expenses ratio in 2008 reflected a lower level of our profit-sharing, or contingent commissions, which are primarily based on the profitability of an agencys aggregate property casualty book of Cincinnati business.
Non-commission underwriting expenses declined in 2009 primarily due to lower depreciation expense on previously capitalized software expenditures. In 2008 there was an unusual expense of $3 million due to a pension charge. Refinements in the allocation of expenses between our commercial lines and personal lines segments also contributed to minor variations between year-to-year comparisons in the non-commission underwriting expenses.
Personal Lines Insurance Outlook A.M. Best estimates industrywide personal lines written premiums may rise approximately 1.8percent in 2010, with the combined ratio estimated at 100.3 percent. With improvement in our new business levels and by maintaining our strong policy retention rate along with rate increases in the homeowner line effected in late 2009, we expect our growth rate to be slightly higher than the industry target for 2010. In Item 1, Strategic Initiatives, Page 8, we discuss the initiatives we are implementing to address the unsatisfactory performance of our personal lines segment, in particular the homeowner line of business. Wealso describe steps that will enhance our response to the changing marketplace. We are aware that our personal lines pricing and loss activity are at levels that could put achievement of our corporate financial objectives at risk if those trends continue. We discuss our overall outlook for our property casualty insurance operations in the Executive Summary, Page 34.
Personal Lines of Business Analysis We prefer to write personal lines coverages within accounts that include both auto and homeowner coverages as well as coverages from the other personal business line. As a result, we believe that the personal lines segment is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis. However, we provide line-of-business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for each line. The accident year loss data provides current estimates of incurred loss and loss expenses and corresponding ratios over the most recent three accident years. Accident year data classifies losses according to the year in which the corresponding loss events occur, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, recorded or paid. For 2009, the personal line of business that exhibited the most significant adverse profitability trend was homeowner. As discussed above, we continue to take action to improve pricing per risk and overall rates, which is expected to improve future profitability trends. In addition, we anticipate that the unusually high Page 59 catastrophe loss level of 2009 may return nearer to the historical average, with the long-term future catastrophe loss ratio improving due to our gradual geographic diversification into states less prone to catastrophe losses.

We continue to monitor and modify selected rates and credits to address our competitive position.
The calendar year loss and loss expense ratio rose slightly over the three-year period. In recent years, we have seen generally higher costs for liability claims, including severe injuries, and we have sought rate increases for liability coverages that partially offset price decreases for physical damage coverages.
Price reductions, in part reflecting our trend toward a higher quality book of business, combined with normal loss cost inflation as the primary drivers in the rise in the accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses since 2007. The 2008 accident year loss and loss expense ratio also reflected refinements made to our IBNR reserve allocation by accident year that contributed approximately 4percentage points.

Both years were lower than 2007 and reflected improved new business levels offset by higher reinsurance premiums in both years. Premiums ceded for reinsurance, which reduce premium revenue, were $22 million in 2009; $26million in 2008, Page 60 including a reinstatement premium of $8 million; and $23 million in 2007. The pricing changes of the past several years have had a positive effect on policyholder retention and new business activity. We continue to monitor and modify selected rates and credits to address our competitive position and to achieve long-term profitability. Implementation of predictive modeling has provided additional pricing points to target profitability. Various rate changes were implemented beginning in October2009, including rate increases that respond in part to weather-related loss trends as well as other trends in loss costs. The increases for the homeowner line of business averaged approximately 6 percent in affected states, although some individual policies will see renewal increases in the double-digit range. These actions, in addition to geographic diversification, are important steps we are taking to improve homeowner results.
The calendar year loss and loss expense ratio over the past three years fluctuated with catastrophe losses, non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other large losses. Catastrophe losses have been above our expected range in recent years, averaging 34.5 percent of homeowner earned premium from 2008 to 2009, compared with the most recent 10-year average of 21.9 percent.
The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses remained high in 2009, in part due to the same non-catastrophe weather related losses and other large losses that affected the calendar year result. Non-catastrophe weather-related losses contributed about 14.0percentage points to the 2009 ratio and about 5 percentage points to the 2008 ratio. In addition, the refinements made to our IBNR reserve allocation by accident year and a lower estimate of salvage and subrogation reserves raised the 2008 ratio by about 2percentage points.

The calendar year and accident year loss and loss expense ratio for other personal improved in 2009. Reserve development on prior accident years can fluctuate significantly for this business line because personal umbrella liability is a major component of other personal losses.
Page 61 Life Insurance Results Of Operations Overview  Three-Year Highlights Performance highlights for the life insurance segment include:  Revenues        Driven by higher term life insurance premiums, earned premiums have       grown over the past three years. Gross in-force policy face amounts       increased to $69.815 billion at year-end 2009 from $65.888billion at       year-end 2008 and $61.875 billion at year-end   2007.
Profitability        The life insurance segment frequently reports only a small profit or       loss because most of its investment income is included in investment       segment results. We include only investment income credited to contract       holders (interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations)       in life insurance segment results. The segment reported a $2 million       profit in 2009.
Life Insurance Results Years       ended December 31, 2009-2008 2008-2007 (In       millions) 2009 2008 2007 Change       % Change       % Earned       premiums $ 143 $ 126 $ 125 13.0 0.8 Separate       account investment management fees - 2 4 nm (56.0 ) Total       revenues 143 128 129 11.5 (1.1 ) Contract       holders' benefits incurred 160 142 133 13.3 6.1 Investment       interest credited to contract holders (69 ) (63 ) (59 ) 10.0 (5.2 ) Operating       expenses incurred 50 45 52 9.1 (12.8 ) Total       benefits and expenses 141 124 126 13.5 (1.2 ) Life       insurance segment profit $ 2 $ 4 $ 3 (52.7 ) 0.9 Life Insurance Growth We market term, whole and universal life products, fixed annuities and disability income products. Inaddition, we offer term, whole and universal life and disability insurance to employees at their worksite. These products provide our property casualty agency force with excellent cross-serving opportunities for both commercial and personal accounts.
Earned premiums increased in 2009 largely because of growth in our term and universal life insurance business. Earned premiums from term insurance grew $10 million, or 13.4 percent, and earned premiums from universal life insurance grew $4 million, or 17.8 percent.
Separate account investment management fee income contributed less than $1 million to total revenue in 2009, compared with a $2 million contribution in 2008 and $4 million in 2007. These fees declined primarily because of a net realized capital loss sharing agreement between the separate account and the general account.
Over the past several years, we have worked to maintain a portfolio of simple, yet competitive products, primarily under the LifeHorizons banner. Our product development efforts emphasize death benefit protection and guarantees. Distribution expansion within our property casualty insurance agencies remains a high priority. In the past several years, we have added life field marketing representatives for the western, southeastern and northeastern states. Our 32 life field marketing representatives work in partnership with our more than 100property casualty field marketing representatives. Approximately 70 percent of our term and other life insurance product premiums were generated through our property casualty insurance agency relationships.
Life Insurance Profitability Although we exclude most of our life insurance company investment income from investment segmentresults, we recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment incomeare integral to evaluation of the success of the life insurance segment because of the long durationof life products. On a basis that includes investment income and realized gains or losses from lifeinsurance-related invested assets, the life insurance company reported a net profit of $22million in 2009, compared with a net loss of $19 million in 2008 and a net profit of $65 million in 2007. The life insurance company portfolio had after-tax realized investment losses of $13 million in 2009, including $15million in other-than-temporary impairment charges, compared with after-tax realized investment losses of $58 million in 2008, which included $66 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges. Realized investment losses were minimal in 2007, when we reported after-tax realized investment gains of $26million. Realized investment gains and losses are discussed under Investment Results of Operations, Page 64.
Life segment expenses consist principally of:  Contract       holders (policyholders) benefits incurred related to traditional life       and interest-sensitive products accounted for 76.4 percent of 2009 total       benefits and expenses compared with 75.7 percent in 2008 and       71.9percent in 2007. Total benefits and expenses rose due to net       death claims that increased but remained within our range of pricing       expectations.
Page 62  Operating       expenses incurred, net of deferred acquisition costs, accounted for 23.6       percent of 2009 total benefits and expenses compared with 24.3 percent in       2008 and 28.1percent in 2007. Operating expenses increased       principally because of the level of commission expense associated with new       term life insurance and fixed annuity policies, partially offset by       deferred acquisition costs related to these   products.
Life segment profitability depends largely on premium levels, the adequacy of product pricing, underwriting skill and operating efficiencies. Life segment results include only investment interest credited to contract holders (interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations). The remaining investment income is reported in the investment segment results. The life investment portfolio is managed to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on general account assets and rates credited to policyholders. We consider the value of assets under management and investment income for the life investment portfolio as key performance indicators for the life insurance segment.
We seek to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to benefits paid and reserve increases by consistently achieving better than average claims experience due to skilled underwriting. Commissions paid by the life insurance operation are on par with industry averages.
During the past several years, we have invested in imaging and workflow technology and have significantly improved application processing. We have achieved process efficiencies while improving our service. These efficiencies have played a significant role in cost containment and in our ability to increase total premiums and policy count over the past 10 years with minimal headcount additions.
Life Insurance Outlook Life insurer balance sheets strengthened nicely in 2009 after weathering a difficult 2008. Many companies increased prices or exited selected lines of business to preserve and enhance valuable capital. Our strong surplus position and straight-forward portfolio of products allowed us to maintain our pricing and continue to offer the products and services upon which our agents have come to rely. This strategy led to strong growth in our life and annuity lines in 2009; we expect this trend will continue with respect to life sales but expect some moderation with respect to annuity sales in 2010.
Our property casualty agencies remain the main distribution system for our life insurance segment, and we continue to emphasize securing an increasing share of the life insurance premium produced by these agencies. While other life insurers continue to expand nontraditional distribution channels such as direct sales, we intend to market through agencies affiliated with our property casualty insurance operations or independent life-only agencies. In 2009 our property casualty agencies produced 70 percent and our life-only agencies 30 percent of our life insurance premium. Term insurance continues to fit well with the sales goals of both our property casualty and life-only agencies and remains our largest product line. We continue to introduce new term products with features our agents tell us are important. We will complete a comprehensive review of our term portfolio as well as introduce a new second-to-die universal life product in 2010. We continue to emphasize the cross-serving opportunities of our worksite products for our property casualty agencies commercial accounts.
As we seek to improve internal efficiencies, we are consolidating our legacy life insurance administrative systems into a single system.We anticipate this effort will be completed by mid-2011.We are also exploring online initiatives including intelligent electronic applications. We expect these projects to directly affect our ability to increase revenue and reduce expenses.
Current statutory laws and regulations require life insurers to hold redundant reserves, particularly for preferred risk underwriting classes. While these redundant reserves have no direct effect on GAAP results, they depress statutory earnings and require a large commitment of capital. Redundant reserves are a significant challenge, not just for our life insurance operations, but for all writers of term insurance and universal life insurance with secondary guarantees.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners recognizes the problems caused by redundant reserves and is considering a principles-based reserving system rather than the current formulaic one. While still capturing all material risks, a principles-based system would allow a company to use its own experience, subject to credibility standards and appropriate margins for uncertainty. Also, under the proposed principles-based system, the insurer would fully document and disclose all of its assumptions and methods to regulatory officials.
Page 63 Investment Results Of Operations Overview  Three-Year Highlights The investment segment contributes investment income and realized gains and losses to results of operations. Investments provide our primary source of pretax and after-tax profits.
Investment       income  Pretax investment income declined 6.8 percent in 2009, primarily       because of prior year dividend cuts in our common stock portfolio. Pretax       investment income declined 11.6percent in 2008, primarily because of       dividend reductions by common and preferred holdings, including reductions       during the year on positions subsequently sold or reduced. After-tax       investment income declined 11.3 percent in 2009 compared with 10.9 percent       in 2008. This after-tax decline has been primarily driven by the       above-mentioned dividend reductions.
Realized       investment gains and losses  We reported realized investment gains in all       three years, largely due to investment sales that were discretionary in       timing and amount. Those sales were somewhat offset in 2009 and 2008,       respectively, by $131 million and $510million of       other-than-temporary impairment charges for the write-down of       50securities in 2009 and 126securities in   2008.

At year-end 2009, the fixed maturities fair       value was104.5 percent of book value compared with       96.2percent at year-end 2008.
Dividend       income declined 50.8 percent in 2009 after declining 30.5 percent in 2008       and rising in 2007. During 2008, we reduced the size of our common stock       portfolio by more than 50 percent in response to actual or anticipated       dividend reductions as well as for the implementation of a risk management       program.
We are investing available cash flow in both fixed income and equity securities in a manner that we believe balances current income needs with longer-term growth goals.

These three areas are discussed below.
Investment gains or losses are recognized upon the sales of investments or as otherwise required under GAAP. The timing of realized gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on results in any quarter.
Page 64 However, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, effect on total shareholders equity because most equity and fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income.
Realized Investment Gains and Losses Asappropriate, we buy, hold or sell both fixed-maturity and equity securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve our portfolio objectives. Pretax realized investment gains in the past three years largely were due to the sale of equity holdings.
Net realized investment gains and losses totaling $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, reflected:  $624       million in realized gains from equity sales including $161 million from       the merger of Wyeth with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE); $133 million from the sale of       ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM); $100 million from the sale of Procter &       Gamble; $67 million from the sale of Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB);       $52million from the sale of Piedmont Natural Gas (NYSE: PNY); and       $111 million from the sale of various other equity     holdings.
$162       million in realized losses from the sales of various equity securities,       including $52 million from the sale of General Electric Co.       (NYSE:GE). These realized losses partially offset the $624 million       in realized gains from equity sales.
$15       million in net losses from fixed-maturity sales and   calls.
$7       million in other net losses, including $6 million from a write-off of an       other invested asset.
In2008, most of the gain was due to sales of holdings of common and preferred stocks of financial services issuers, to reduce our historical weighting in financial sector securities. The majority of these holdings were sold following reductions or elimination of their cash dividends to shareholders. Because of our low cost basis, we were able to record gains on many of these sales despite the decline in overall stock market values during 2008. Realized gains were lower in 2007, although we chose to take gains from partial sales of selected holdings and to sell other holdings because of general credit concerns that began in the subprime mortgage market and spread to other areas in the homebuilding and related industries over the course of 2007.
We generally purchase fixed income securities with the intention to hold until maturity. Securities that no longer meet our investment criteria, usually due to a change in credit fundamentals, are divested.
Change in the Valuation of Securities with Embedded Derivatives We have a small portfolio of convertible preferred stocks and bonds, which have an embedded derivative component. In 2009 we recorded $27 million in fair value realized gains compared with $38 million and $11million in fair value declines for 2008 and 2007. These changes in fair value were due to the application of ASC 815-15-25, which allows us to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value, with changes recognized in realized investment gains and losses. The changes in fair values are recognized in net income in the period they occur. See the discussion of Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in Item8, Note1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page94,for details on the accounting for convertible security embedded options.
Other-than-temporary Impairment Charges In 2009, we recorded $131 million in write-downs of 50 securities that we deemed had experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value versus $510 million for 126 securities in 2008 and $16 million in 2007. The factors we consider when evaluating impairments are discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates, Asset Impairment, Page 42. Theother-than-temporary impairment charges in 2009 approximated 1.2percent of our total invested assets at year-end compared with 5.7 percent for 2008. Other-than-temporary impairment charges also include unrealized losses of holdings that we intend to sell but have not yet completed a transaction.
Page 65 Other-than-temporary impairment charges from the investment portfolio by the asset class we described in Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 18, are summarized below: Years       ended December 31, (Dollars       in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Taxable       fixed maturities: Impairment       amount $ (61 ) $ (162 ) $ (14 ) New       book value $ 81 $ 187 $ 46 Percent       to total owned 2 % 6 % 1 % Number       of securities impaired 37 86 18 Percent       to total owned 3 % 10 % 2 % Tax-exempt       fixed maturities: Impairment       amount $ (1 ) $ (1 ) $ 0 New       book value $ 3 $ 1 $ 0 Percent       to total owned 0 % 0 % 0 % Number       of securities impaired 2 1 0 Percent       to total owned 0 % 0 % 0 % Common       equities: Impairment       amount $ (59 ) $ (214 ) $ (2 ) New       book value $ 48 $ 87 $ 2 Percent       to total owned 2 % 5 % 0 % Number       of securities impaired 8 9 2 Percent       to total owned 16 % 18 % 4 % Preferred       equities: Impairment       amount $ (10 ) $ (133 ) $ 0 New       book value $ 5 $ 98 $ 0 Percent       to total owned 7 % 52 % 0 % Number       of securities impaired 3 30 0 Percent       to total owned 12 % 86 % 0 % Total: Impairment       amount $ (131 ) $ (510 ) $ (16 ) New       book value $ 137 $ 373 $ 48 Percent       to total owned 1 % 5 % 1 % Number       of securities impaired 50 126 20 Percent       to total owned 2 % 6 % 1 % Other-than-temporary impairment charges from the investment portfolio by industry are summarized asfollows: Years       ended December 31, (In       millions) 2009 2008 2007 Fixed       maturities: Financial $ (30 ) $ (72 ) $ (4 ) Services       cyclical (14 ) (17 ) (6 ) Real       estate (11 ) (49 ) 0 Consumer       cyclical (5 ) (14 ) (1 ) Other (2 ) (11 ) (3 ) Total       fixed maturities (62 ) (163 ) (14 ) Common       equities: Industrials (35 ) 0 0 Consumer       discretionary (10 ) 0 0 Material (8 ) 0 0 Health (6 ) (30 ) 0 Financial 0 (184 ) 0 Real       estate 0 0 (2 ) Total       common equities (59 ) (214 ) (2 ) Preferred       equities: Financial (10 ) (132 ) 0 Other 0 (1 ) 0 Total       preferred equities (10 ) (133 ) 0 Total $ (131 ) $ (510 ) $ (16 ) The decrease in other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2009 was largely due to the improvement in values as asset markets rebounded. The increase in other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2008 was largely due to write-downs of holdings of bonds and common and preferred stocks of financial services issuers, reflecting our historical weighting in this sector and the decline in overall stock market values during 2008.
Page 66 Investments Outlook We continue to focus on portfolio strategies to balance near-term income generation and long-term book value growth. In 2010, we expect to continue to allocate a portion of cash available for investment to equity securities, taking into consideration corporate liquidity and income requirements, as well as insurance department regulations and ratings agency comments. We discuss our portfolio strategies in Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 18.
We believe that a weak or prolonged recovery from current economic conditions could heighten the risk of renewed pressure on securities markets, which could lead to additional other-than-temporary impairment charges. Ourasset impairment committee continues to monitor the investment portfolio. The current asset impairment policy is described in Critical Accounting Estimates, Asset Impairment, Page42.
Other Revenues for our Other businesses increased during 2009, primarily due to earned premiums from our excess and surplus lines business. Other also includes other income of our standard market insurance subsidiary, as well as non-investment operations of the parent company and its subsidiary, CFCInvestment Company, and former subsidiary CinFin Capital Management Company. Upon commencing our excess and surplus lines operations in 2008, we also included results of The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company and CSU Producer Resources.
Losses before income taxes for Other were largely driven by interest expense from debt of the parent company plus losses and loss expenses and underwriting expenses from our excess and surplus linesoperation.

Theeffective tax rate for 2009 was 25.7 percent compared with 20.7 percent in 2008 and 28.3percent in2007.
The change in our effective tax rate was driven by changes in pretax income from underwriting results, investment income from dividends and the amount of realized investment gains and losses. Higher tax-exempt interest and changes in our dividends received deduction in the current year compared with prior years also contributed with the change in the effective tax rates from 2007 to 2009.
Historically, we have pursued a strategy of investing some portion of cash flow in tax-advantaged fixed-maturity and equity securities to minimize our overall tax liability and maximize after-tax earnings. See Tax-Exempt Fixed Maturities, Page 19 for further discussion on municipal bond purchases in our fixed-maturity investment portfolio.For our insurance subsidiaries, approximately 85 percent of income from tax-advantaged fixed-maturity investments is exempt from federal tax. Our non-insurance companies own an immaterial amount of tax-advantaged fixed-maturity investments. For our insurance subsidiaries, the dividend received deduction, after the dividend proration of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, exempts approximately 60 percent of dividends from qualified equities from federal tax. For our non-insurance subsidiaries, the dividend received deduction exempts 70percent of dividends from qualified equities. Details about our effective tax rate are found on Note11, Income Taxes, Page108.
Page 67 Liquidity And Capital Resources Liquidity and capital resources represent the overall financial strength of our company and our ability to generate cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of business obligations and growth needs. We seek to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and financial strength for the protection of our policyholders, creditors and shareholders. We manage liquidity at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the parent company. The second is the liquidity of our insurance subsidiary. The management of liquidity at both levels is essential because each has different funding needs and sources, and each is subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements.
Parent Company Liquidity The parent companys primary means of meeting liquidity requirements are dividends from our insurance subsidiary, investment income and sale proceeds from investments held at the parent company level. The parent companys primary contractual obligations are interest and principal payments on long- and short-term debt as described under Contractual Obligations, Page 71. Other uses of parent company cash include general operating expenses described under Other Commitments, Page 71, as well as dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. As of December 31, 2009, the parent company had $998million in cash and marketable securities, providing strong liquidity to fund uses of cash.
This table below shows a summary, by the direct method, of the major sources and uses of liquidity by the parentcompany. Dividends received in 2009 and 2008 from our insurance subsidiary were much lower than in the several years prior to that, in order to maintain strong statutory surplus and financial strength ratings. We expect sources of liquidity to increase in 2010 and beyond, as we anticipate investment income growth and improved profitability for our property casualty operations. A dividend of $50 million was received from our insurance subsidiary in January 2010. The majority of expenditures for the parent company have been consistent during the last three years, and we expect future expenditures to remain fairly stable.
Years       ended December 31, (In       millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sources       of liquidity: Insurance       subsidiary dividends received $ 0 $ 220 $ 450 Other       operating subsidiaries' dividends received 0 10 0 Investment       income received 41 81 99 Uses       of liquidity: Debt       interest payments $ 52 $ 53 $ 52 Pension       payments 34 34 10 Shareholders       dividend payments 249 250 240 Purchase       (issuance) of treasury shares (1 ) 138 307 At the discretion of the board of directors, the company can return cash directly to shareholders:  Dividends       to shareholders  Over the past 10 years, the company has paid an average       of 39.9percent of net income as dividends. The ability of the       company to continue paying cash dividends is subject to factors the board       of directors may deem relevant.
Through 2009, the board had increased our cash dividend for 49 consecutive years. The board decision in August 2009 to increase the dividend demonstrated confidence in the companys strong capital, liquidity, financial flexibility and initiatives to improve earnings performance. While the board and management believe there is merit to sustaining the companys record of dividend increases, our first priority is the companys financial strength.
Common       stock repurchase  Generally, our board believes that stock repurchases       can help fulfill our commitment to enhancing shareholder value.       Consequently, the board has authorized the repurchase of outstanding       shares, giving management discretion to purchase shares at reasonable       prices in light of circumstances at the time of purchase, pursuant to SEC       regulations.
Consistent with our approach for the second half of 2008, in 2009 we chose to preserve capital rather than repurchase shares. During the first half of 2008, we repurchased 3.8 million shares. In the past, repurchases have occurred when we believed that stock prices on the open market were favorable for such repurchases. Our corporate Code of Conduct restricts repurchases during certain time periods. Thedetails of the repurchase authorizations and activity are described in Item5, Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, Page30. Between February1999 and year-end 2009, we have repurchased 28.7million shares at a total cost to the company of $1.105billion. Wedonot adjust the number of shares repurchased and average price per repurchased share for stockdividends.
Page 68 Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity Our insurance subsidiarys primary means of meeting liquidity requirements are investment income, sale proceeds from investments held at the subsidiary level and collection of insurance premiums. Property casualty insurance premiums generally are received before losses are paid under the policies purchased with those premiums. While first-year life insurance expenses normally exceed first-year premiums, subsequent premiums are used to generate investment income until the policy benefits are paid or the policy term expires.
Our insurance subsidiaries primary contractual obligations are property casualty loss and loss expenses and life policyholder obligations as well as certain ongoing operating expenses as shown under Contractual Obligations, Page71. Other uses of insurance subsidiary cash include payments of dividends to the parent company and other operating expenses as discussed under Other Commitments, Page 71.
This table shows a summary of operating cash flow of the insurance subsidiary (direct method): Years       ended December 31, (In       millions) 2009 2008 2007 Premiums       collected $ 3,083 $ 3,163 $ 3,256 Loss       and loss expenses paid (2,030 ) (2,064 ) (1,888 ) Commissions       and other underwriting expenses paid (1,049 ) (1,078 ) (1,053 ) Insurance       subsidiary cash flow from underwriting 4 21 315 Investment       income received 432 475 502 Insurance       subsidiary operating cash flow $ 436 $ 496 $ 817 Over the past three years, cash receipts from property casualty and life insurance premiums, along with investment income, have been more than sufficient to pay claims, operating expenses and dividends to the parent company. We discuss the factors that affected insurance operations in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines Insurance Results of Operations, Page 48 and Page 57.
Additional Sources of Liquidity Investing is a primary source of liquidity for both the parent company and our insurance subsidiary operations. Forboth, cash in excess of operating requirements is invested in fixed-maturity and equity securities. Equity securities provide the potential for future increases in dividend income and for appreciation. In Item1, Investments Segment, Page 18, we discuss our investment strategy, portfolio allocation and quality.
Income from our investments is the most important investment contribution to cash flow. While we have never sold investments to make claims payments, the sale of investments could provide an additional source of liquidity at either the parent company or insurance subsidiary level, ifrequired, although we follow a buy-and-hold investment philosophy seeking to compound cash flows over the long-term. In addition to possible sales of investments, proceeds of call or maturities of fixed maturities also can provide liquidity. During the next five years, $2.135 billion, or 28.4 percent, of our fixed-maturity portfolio will mature. At year-end 2009, total unrealized gains in the investment portfolio, before deferred income taxes, were $1.026billion, up from $588 million at year-end 2008. Net unrealized gains in 2009 nearly doubled from year-end 2008, even after a significant amount of gains was realized during 2009. Further, financial resources of the parent company also could be made available to our insurance subsidiaries, if circumstances required. This flexibility would include our ability to access the capital markets and short-term bank borrowings.
One way we seek to maintain a solid financial position and provide capital flexibility is by keeping our ratio of debt to total capital moderate. We target a ratio below 20percent. At year-end 2009, the ratio was 15.0percent compared with 16.7 percent at year-end 2008. The decrease in the debt-to-total-capital ratio was due entirely to the increase in shareholders equity at year-end 2009. Based on our present capital requirements, we do not believe we will need to increase debt levels during 2010. As a result, we believe that changes in our debt-to-capital ratio will again be a function of changes in shareholders equity.
We had $790 million of long-term debt and $49 million in borrowings on our short-term lines of credit at year-end 2009. We generally have minimized our reliance on debt financing although we may use lines of credit to fund short-term cash needs.
Long-Term Debt We provide details of our three long-term notes in Item 8, Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 106. None of the notes are encumbered by rating triggers:  $391       million aggregate principal amount of 6.92% senior debentures due       2028.
$28       million aggregate principal amount of 6.9% senior debentures due       2028.
$374       million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior debentures due       2034.
The companys senior debt is rated investment grade by independent ratings firms. On August 2, 2009, Fitch Ratings lowered our senior debt rating from A- to BBB+. Three other rating agencies made no changes Page 69 to our debt ratings in 2009. Our debt ratings from the other rating agencies are: a from A.M. Best, A3 from Moodys Investors Service and BBB+ from Standard & Poors Ratings Services. The ratings are described in Item1, Financial Strength, Page3.
Short-Term Debt At December 31, 2009, we had two lines of credit with commercial banks amounting to $225 million, with $49million borrowed. Access to these lines of credit requires compliance with various covenants, including maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth and not exceeding a certain debt-to-capital ratio. As of December 31, 2009, we were well within compliance with all of the covenants under the credit agreements.
Our $75 million unsecured line of credit with PNC Bank, N.A. was established more than five years ago and was renewed effective August 31, 2009, for a one-year term to expire on August 29, 2010. CFCInvestment Company, a subsidiary of Cincinnati Financial Corporation, also is a borrower under this line of credit. At year-end 2008, $49 million was outstanding on this line of credit, which was repaid in 2009. PNC Bank is a subsidiary of PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC).
Thesecond line of credit is an unsecured $150 million revolving line of credit administered by TheHuntington National Bank. It was established in2007 and will mature in 2012. CFCInvestment Company, a subsidiary of Cincinnati Financial Corporation, also is a borrower under this line of credit. At year-end 2009, there was $49million outstanding on this line of credit. The Huntington National Bank, a subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Inc. (NASDAQ:HBAN), is the lead participant with a $75million share. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) also participate, each providing $25million of capacity.
The line of credit includes a swing line sub-facility for same-day borrowing in the amount of $35million. Thecredit agreement provides alternative interest charges based on the type of borrowing and our debt rating. The interest rate charged for an advancement is adjusted LIBOR plus the applicable margin. Basedon our debt ratings at year-end 2009, interest for Eurodollar rate advances is adjusted LIBOR plus 33basis points, and for floating rate advances is adjusted LIBOR. Utilization and commitment fees based on Cincinnati Financial Corporations current debt rating are 5basis points and 8 basis points, respectively.CFC Investment Company, a subsidiary of Cincinnati Financial Corporation, is a co-borrower under the agreement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook A long-term perspective governs all of our major decisions, with the goal of benefiting our policyholders, agents, shareholders and associates over time. While our insurance results remained weak for 2009, even after a strong second half of the year, our improved capital position from year-end 2008 provided adequate cushion. We have taken the necessary steps to protect our capital and are confident in our strategies to return our insurance operations to growth and profitability.
Our consistent cash flows and prudent cash balances continue to create strong liquidity. As of December31, 2009, we had $557 million in cash and cash equivalents. That strong liquidity and our consistent cash flows gives us the flexibility to meet current obligations while building value by prudently investing where we see potential for both current income and long-term return.
In any year, we consider the most likely source of pressure on liquidity would be an unusually high level of catastrophe losses within a short period of time. This could create additional obligations for our insurance operations by increasing the severity or frequency of claims. To address the risk of unusual insurance loss obligations including catastrophe events, we maintain property casualty reinsurance contracts with highly rated reinsurers, as discussed under 2010 Reinsurance Programs, Page 79. We also monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers because an insolvency could place in jeopardy a portion of our $675 million in outstanding reinsurance recoverables as of December31,2009.
Continued economic weakness also has the potential to affect our liquidity and capital resources in a number of different ways, including: delinquent payments from agencies, defaults on interest payments by fixed-maturity holdings in our portfolio, dividend reductions by holdings in our equity portfolio or declines in the market value of holdings in our portfolio.
Further, parent company liquidity could be constrained by State of Ohio regulatory requirements that restrict the dividends insurance subsidiaries can pay. During 2010, total dividends that our insurance subsidiary can pay to our parent company without regulatory approval are approximately $365million.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We do not use any special-purpose financing vehicles or have any undisclosed off-balance-sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in applicable SEC rules) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the companys financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Similarly, the company holds no fair-value contracts for which a lack of marketplace quotations would necessitate the use of fair-value techniques.
Page 70 Obligations We pay obligations to customers, suppliers and associates in the normal course of our business operations. Some are contractual obligations that define the amount, circumstances and/or timing of payments. We have other commitments for business expenditures; however, the amount, circumstances and/or timing of our other commitments are not dictated by contractual arrangements.
Other Commitments As of December 31, 2009, we believe our most significant other commitments are:  Qualified       pension plan  In 2010, we currently estimate a voluntary cash       contribution of $25million to our qualified pension plan, a $12       million net pension expense and a $7 million expense for company       401(k)contributions. Going forward, potential savings due to lower       funding requirements for the pension plan are expected to be offset by the       company 401(k) contributions. In 2008, we chose to transition away from a       defined benefit plan to reduce the companys future market risk while       offering associates an up-to-date, more flexible benefits program. We       discuss the change to the pension plan, future contributions and plan       assets in Item 8, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,       Page109.
Commissions        We expect commission payments to generally track with written premiums.       We discuss commission trends in the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines       Insurance Results of Operations, Page49 and Page   57.
Other       operating expenses  Many of our operating expenses are not contractual       obligations but reflect the ongoing expenses of our business. Technology        In addition to contractual obligations for hardware and software discussed       below, we anticipate capitalizing approximately $20 million in spending       for key technology initiatives in 2010. Technology projects are discussed       in Item 1, Strategic Initiatives, Page8. Capitalized development       costs related to key technology initiatives totaled $28 million in 2009       and $38 million in 2008. These activities are conducted at our discretion,       and we have no material contractual obligations for activities planned as       part of these projects.
Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2009, we estimate our future contractual obligations as follows: Payment       due by period Year Years Years There- (In       millions) 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 after Total Gross       property casualty loss and loss expense payments $ 1,210 $ 1,324 $ 590 $ 972 $ 4,096 Gross       life policyholder obligations 46 76 112 3,268 3,502 Interest       on long-term debt 52 104 104 838 1,098 Long-term       debt 0 0 0 793 793 Short-term       debt 49 0 0 0 49 Profit-sharing       commissions 81 0 0 0 81 Operating       property 1 0 0 0 1 Capital       lease obligations 12 15 1 0 28 Computer       hardware and software 12 13 3 0 28 Other       invested assets 4 7 0 0 11 Total $ 1,467 $ 1,539 $ 810 $ 5,871 $ 9,687 Our most significant contractual obligations are discussed in conjunction with related insurance reserves in Gross Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Payments and Gross Life Insurance Policyholder Obligations on Page 71 and Page 78, respectively. Other future contractual obligations include:  Interest       on long- and short-term debt  We expect total interest expense to be       approximately $52million in 2010. We discuss outstanding debt in       Additional Sources of Liquidity, Page 69.
Profit-sharing       commissions  Profit-sharing, or contingent, commissions are paid to       agencies using a formula that takes into account agency profitability and       other factors. We estimate 2010 contingent commission payments of       approximately $81 million. We discuss commission expense trends in       Commercial Lines and Personal Lines Insurance Results of Operations, Page       49 and Page 57.
Computer       hardware and software  We expect to need approximately $25 million over       the next three years for current material commitments for computer       hardware and software, including maintenance contracts on hardware and       other known obligations. Wediscussed above the non-contractual       expenses we anticipate for computer hardware and software in       2010.
Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Obligations and Reserves Gross Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Payments Our estimate of future gross property casualty loss and loss expense payments of $4.096 billion is lower than loss and loss expense reserves of $4.142 billion as of year-end 2009. The $46 million difference is Page 71 due to life and health loss reserves, as discussed in Item8, Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page 105.
While we believe that historical performance of property casualty and life loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments, there is inherent uncertainty in this estimate of contractual obligations. We believe that we could meet our obligations under a significant and unexpected change in the timing of these payments because of the liquidity of our invested assets, strong financial position and access to lines of credit.
Our estimates of gross property casualty loss and loss expense payments also do not include reinsurancereceivables or ceded losses. Asdiscussed in 2010 Reinsurance Programs, Page 79, we purchase reinsurance to mitigate our property casualty risk exposure. Ceded property casualty reinsurance unpaid receivables of $435million at year-end 2009 are an offset to our gross property casualty loss and loss expense obligations. Our reinsurance program mitigates the liquidity risk of a single large loss or an unexpected rise in claim severity or frequency due to a catastrophic event. Reinsurance does not relieve usof our obligation to pay covered claims. The financial strength of our reinsurers is important because ourability to recover losses under our reinsurance agreements depends on the financial viability of thereinsurers.
We direct our associates and agencies to settle claims and pay losses as quickly as is practical and we made $1.923billion of netclaim payments during 2009. At year-end 2009, net property casualty reserves reflected $2.026billion in unpaid amounts on reported claims (case reserves), $792million in loss expense reserves and $843million in estimates of claims that were incurred but had not yet been reported (IBNR). Thespecific amounts and timing of obligations related to case reserves and associated loss expenses are not set contractually. The amounts and timing of obligations for IBNR claims and related loss expenses are unknown. We discuss our methods of establishing loss and loss expense reserves and our belief that reserves are adequate in Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves, Page 38.
The historical pattern of using premium receipts for the payment of loss and loss expenses has enabled us to extend slightly the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of the loss reserves. Theeffective duration of our consolidated fixed-maturity portfolio was 5.3 years at year-end 2009. Bycontrast, the duration of our loss and loss expense reserves was approximately three years. We believe this difference in duration does not affect our ability to meet current obligations because cash flow from operations is sufficient to meet these obligations. In addition, investment holdings could be liquidated, if necessary, to meet higher than anticipated loss and loss expenses.
Range of Reasonable Reserves The company established a reasonably likely range for net loss and loss expense reserves of $3.459billion to $3.774 billion at year-end 2009, with the company carrying net reserves of $3.661 billion. The likely range was $3.256billion to $3.592 billion at year-end 2008, with the company carrying net reserves of $3.498billion. Our loss and loss expense reserves are not discounted for the time-value of money, but we have reduced the reserves by an estimate of the amount of salvage and subrogation payments we expect to recover. Weprovide a reconciliation of the property casualty reserves with the loss and loss expense reserve as shown on the balance sheet in Item8, Note5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page105.
The low point of each years range corresponds to approximately one standard error below each years mean reserve estimate, while the high point corresponds to approximately one standard error above each years mean reserve estimate. We discussed managements reasons for basing reasonably likely reserve ranges on standard errors in Critical Accounting Estimates, Reserve Estimate Variability, Page 41.
The ranges reflect our assessment of the most likely unpaid loss and loss expenses at year-end 2009 and2008. However, actual unpaid loss and loss expenses could nonetheless fall outside of the indicatedranges.
Managements best estimate of total loss and loss expense reserves as of year-end 2009 was consistent with the corresponding actuarial best estimate. Managements best estimate of total loss and loss expense reserves as of year-end2008 also was consistent with the corresponding actuarial best estimate.
Development of Reserves for Loss and Loss Expenses We reconcile the beginning and ending balances of our reserves for loss and loss expenses at December31,2009, 2008 and 2007, in Item 8, Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Page105. The reconciliation of our year-end 2008 reserve balance to net incurred losses one year later recognizes approximately $188million of favorable reserve development.
The table on the following page shows the development of estimated reserves for loss and loss expenses for the past 10years.
Section       A shows our total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves       recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated calendar       years on a gross and net basis. Those reserves represent Page 72 the estimated amount of unpaid loss and loss expenses for claims arising in the indicated calendar year and all prior accident years at the balance sheet date, including losses that were incurred but not yet reported to the company.
Section       B shows the cumulative net amount paid with respect to the previously       recorded reserve as of the end of each succeeding year. For example, as of       December 31, 2009, we had paid $1.567 billion of loss and loss expenses in       calendar years 2000 through 2009 for losses that occurred in accident       years 1999and prior. An estimated $201 million of losses remained       unpaid as of year-end 2009 (netre-estimated reserves of $1.768       billion from Section C less cumulative net paid loss and loss expenses       of$1.567billion).
Section       C shows the re-estimated amount of the previously reported reserves based       on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate is       increased or decreased as we learn more about the development of the       related claims.
Section D, cumulative net reserve development, represents the aggregate change in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the reserves were initially established. For example, reserves established at December 31, 1999, had developed favorably by $164 million over 10 years, net of reinsurance, which was reflected in income over the 10 years. The table shows favorable reserve development as a negative number. Favorable reserve development on prior accident years, which represents a negative expense, is favorable to income. The reconciliation shows theeffects on income before income taxes in 2009, 2008 and 2007 of changes in estimates of the reserves for loss and loss expenses for all accident years. The effect was favorable to pre-tax income for those three years by $188million, $323million, and $244 million, respectively. Our annual review has led us to add to income in each of the past 21 years due to favorable development of reserves on prior accident years.
In evaluating the development of our estimated reserves for loss and loss expenses for the past 10years, note that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, payments or reserve adjustments related to losses settled in 2009 but incurred in 2002 are included in the cumulative deficiency or redundancy amount for 2002 and each subsequent year. In addition, this table presents calendar year data, not accident or policy year development data, which readers may be more accustomed to analyzing. Conditions and trends that affected development of reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future reserve development based on this data.
Differences between the property casualty reserves reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (prepared in accordance with GAAP) and those same reserves reported in the annual statements (filed with state insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting practices  SAP), relate principally to the reporting of reinsurance recoverables, which are recognized as receivables for GAAP and as an offset to reserves for SAP.

These amounts constitute 3.2percent and 3.3 percent of total loss and loss expense reserves as of these year-end dates.
We believe our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims is limited, largely because our reinsurance retention was $500,000 or below prior to 1987. We also predominantly were a personal lines company in the 1960s and 1970s when asbestos and pollution exclusions were not widely used. During the 1980s and early 1990s, commercial lines grew as a percentage of our overall business and our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims grew accordingly. Over that period, we endorsed to or included in most policies an asbestos and environmental exclusion.
Additionally, since 2002, we have revised policy terms where permitted by state regulation to limit our exposure to mold claims prospectively and further reduce our exposure to other environmental claims generally. Finally, we have not engaged in any mergers or acquisitions through which such a liability could have been assumed. We continue to monitor our claims for evidence of material exposure to other mass tort classes such as silicosis, but we have found no such credible evidence to date.
Reserving data for asbestos and environmental claims has characteristics that limit the usefulness of the methods and models used to analyze loss and loss expense reserves for other claims. Specifically, asbestos and environmental loss and loss expenses for different accident years do not emerge independently of one another as loss development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods assume. In addition, asbestos and environmental loss and loss expense data available to date does not reflect a well-defined tail, greatly complicating the identification of an appropriate probabilistic trend family model.
Page 74 Due to these considerations, our actuarial staff elected to use a paid survival ratio method to estimate reserves for incurred but not yet reported asbestos and environmental claims. Although highly uncertain, reserve estimates obtained via this method have developed in a reasonably stable fashion since 2004. Between 2006 and 2009, total asbestos and environmental reserves decreased 9.6 percent. Since our exposure to such claims is limited, we believe the paid survival ratio method is sufficient.
Commercial Lines Insurance Segment Reserves For the business lines in the commercial lines insurance segment, the following table shows the breakout of gross reserves among case, IBNR and loss expense reserves. The rise in total gross reserves for our commercial business lines is primarily due to workers compensation IBNR reserve strengthening, as discussed in Commercial Lines Insurance Results of Operations, Page 49.

Favorable reserve development of $154 million for the commercial casualty line exceeded the segment total in 2009, while adverse reserve development for the workers compensation line reduced segment favorable reserve development by $48 million. Drivers of commercial casualty and workers compensation reserve development are discussed below.
Refinements to umbrella       liability reserving As discussed on page 79 of our 2008 Annual       Report on 10-K, our actuaries introduced a second reserving model at the       end of 2008 to improve the accuracy of estimates of commercial umbrella       liability loss reserves, which are a component of our commercial casualty       reserves. Further work on these models led to a change in the weighting       accorded to each models estimate for deriving actuarial best estimates in       2009. If this change had been in place at the time year-end 2008 reserves       were established, commercial casualty reserves at year-end 2008 would have       been approximately $19 million lower. Accordingly, 2009 favorable reserve       development would have been reduced by a like   amount.
Flat paid loss trends Two of our commercial casualty coverages exhibited flat paid loss trends       in 2009, which differed from our expectations. Trends in paid losses on a       calendar-year basis for medical malpractice and non-discounted       premises/operations coverages were essentially flat in 2009, while       year-end 2008 reserve estimates reflected upward trends of over 8 percent       for these coverages. Had our actuaries reflected these flat trends in paid       losses in their reserve estimates a year ago, commercial casualty reserves       at year-end 2008 would have been reduced by $22 million, and favorable       reserve development in 2009 would have been similarly     lower.
Moderation in trend       selections Various commercial casualty coverages that we write       have reflected moderating loss cost trends over periods of one or more       years. A number of factors seem to have played a role, including sluggish       economic activity, favorable court decisions, policy form restrictions,       medical malpractice tort reform and claims department initiatives.       Accordingly, it is not wholly clear whether these moderating loss cost       trends represent short-term or longer-term changes, and our Page 76 actuaries have responded cautiously to these changes, electing to recognize improvements in trends used for estimating reserves in a progressive, incremental fashion. If the resulting, revised trends had been used to estimate year-end 2008 reserves, those reserves and 2009 favorable reserve development would have been $31 million lower.
Unusual deviations from       predictions of reserving methods and models Similar to 2008,       commercial multi-peril liability coverages made a major contribution to       favorable reserve development again in 2009, because both paid loss and       reported loss emergence deviated favorably from projections. Projected to       rise more than $5 million in 2009, calendar year paid losses on these       coverages, excluding asbestos and environmental claims, fell by $22       million instead. Reported losses for accident years 2005 and 2008 also       developed more favorably than expected, while reported loss development       related to other accident years aligned closely with expectations. If our       actuaries had been able to take this information into account when       estimating year-end 2008 reserves, their estimates would have been $59       million lower, as would 2009 favorable reserve   development.
Workers compensation reserve       strengthening Additions to workers compensation IBNR reserves on       accident years prior to 2009 lowered commercial lines favorable reserve       development by $48 million. A reserving model adjustment necessitated by       increasingly large deviations between expected and actual paid loss       emergence prompted the additions to IBNR reserves.To account       for the increasingly large deviations, our actuaries partially shifted the       attribution of recent accident years paid loss growth from exposure       growth to loss cost inflation in their workers compensation reserving       models. This adjustment produced a significantly higher estimate of loss       cost inflation, which raised reserve estimates for all active accident       years, not just the recent accident years for which paid loss growth had       been previously misinterpreted. The reserving models resulting from this       adjustment would have increased the year-end 2008 reserve estimate for       workers compensation by approximately $61 million had they been available       at the time the estimate was derived. In such an event, 2009 favorable       reserve development would have increased by a comparable       amount.
Refinement in       commercial/personal umbrella liability IBNR Reserve Allocation A       2009 study indicated that personal umbrella coverages had been allocated       too large a portion of the total IBNR reserve for all umbrella coverages.       As a result, $7 million of personal umbrella IBNR reserves was shifted to       commercial umbrella, partially offsetting the favorable reserve       development detailed in the first four points   above.
The above points cover drivers of commercial casualty and workers compensation reserve development in 2009 attributable to unusual deviations from expectations and changes in methods, models, and procedures. An examination of factors contributing to the remaining $41 million of commercial lines favorable reserve development, not accounted for by the commercial casualty and workers compensation lines, did not turn up any abnormal or unexpected variations. As noted in Critical Accounting Estimates, Key Assumptions - Loss Reserving, Page 40, our models predict that actual loss and loss expense emergence will differ from projections, and we do not attempt to monitor or identify such normal variations.
Personal Lines Insurance Segment Reserves For the business lines in the personal lines insurance segment, the following table shows the breakout ofgross reserves among case, IBNR and loss expense reserves. Total gross reserves were down from year-end2008 due to favorable reserve development and the decline in premiums and exposures for this segment, as we discussed in Personal Lines Insurance Results of Operations, Page 57.

Several atypical factors discussed in Commercial Lines Insurance Segment Reserves, Page 75, that contributed to commercial lines segment reserve development in 2009 also contributed to personal lines favorable reserve development.
In consideration of the datas credibility, we analyze commercial and personal umbrella liability reserves together and then allocate the derived total reserve estimate to the commercial and personal coverages. Consequently, all of the umbrella factors that contributed to commercial lines reserve development also contributed to personal lines reserve development through the other personal line, of which personal umbrella coverages are a part. Specifically, refinements in the use of umbrella reserving models, revisions to umbrella trend selections, and refinements in the umbrella reserve allocation all contributed favorably to other personal reserve development in 2009. If our actuaries had reflected all of this information and these related changes in their year-end 2008 reserve estimates, other personal reserves carried at year-end 2008 would have been $19 million lower. Accordingly, favorable reserve development in 2009 for the other personal line and the personal lines segment would have been lower by a like amount.
Life Insurance Policyholder Obligations and Reserves Gross Life Insurance Policyholder Obligations Our estimates of life, annuity and disability policyholder obligations reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders for future policy benefits, policyholders account balances and separate account liabilities. These estimates include death and disability claims, policy surrenders, policy maturities, annuity payments, minimum guarantees on separate account products, commissions and premium taxes offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts.
Our estimates of gross life, annuity and disability obligations do not reflect net recoveries from reinsurance agreements. Ceded life reinsurance receivables were $213 million at year-end 2009. As discussed in Page 78 2010Reinsurance Programs, Page 79, we purchase reinsurance to mitigate our life insurance risk exposure. Atyear-end 2009, ceded death benefits represented approximately 49.0percent of our total policy face amounts in force.
These estimated cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest. As a result, the sum of the cash outflows for all years of $3.502 billion (total of life insurance obligations) exceeds the liabilities recorded in life policy reserves and separate accounts for future policy benefits and claims of $2.399 billion (total of life insurance policy reserves and separate account policy reserves). Separate account policy reserves make up all but $2 million of separate accounts liabilities.
We have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these policies and contracts that include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates and interest crediting rates. Dueto the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actualresults.
Life Insurance Reserves Gross life policy reserves were $1.783 billion at year-end 2009, compared with $1.551 billion at year-end 2008. We establish reserves for traditional life insurance policies based on expected expenses, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a provision for uncertainty. Once these assumptions are established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. We use both our own experience and industry experience adjusted for historical trends in arriving at our assumptions for expected mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates. We use our own experience and historical trends for setting our assumptions for expected expenses. We base our assumptions for expected investment income on our own experience adjusted for current economic conditions.
We establish reserves for our universal life, deferred annuity and investment contracts equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. Some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. For these policies, we establish a reserve in addition to the account balance based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.
We regularly review our life insurance business to ensure that any deferred acquisition cost associated with the business is recoverable and that our actuarial liabilities (life insurance segment reserves) make sufficient provision for future benefits and related expenses.
2010 Reinsurance Programs A single large loss or an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency due to a catastrophic event couldpresent us with a liquidity risk. In an effort to control such losses, we avoid marketing property casualty insurance in specific geographic areas, monitor our exposure in certain coastal regions, review aggregate exposures to huge disasters and purchase reinsurance. We use the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) andApplied Insurance Research (AIR) models to evaluate exposures to a once-in-a-100 year and a once-in-a-250 year event to help determine appropriate reinsurance coverage programs. In conjunction with these activities, we also continue to evaluate information provided by our reinsurance broker. These various sources explore and analyze credible scientific evidence, including the impact of global climate change, which may affect our exposure under insurance policies.
Reinsurance mitigates the risk of highly uncertain exposures and limits the maximum net loss that can arise from large risks or risks concentrated in areas of exposure. Managements decisions about the appropriate level of risk retention are affected by various factors, including changes in our underwriting practices, capacity to retain risks and reinsurance market conditions. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to pay covered claims. The financial strength of our reinsurers is important because our ability to recover for losses covered under any reinsurance agreement depends on the financial viability of the reinsurer.
Currently participating on our standard market property and casualty per-risk and per-occurrence programs are Hannover Reinsurance Company, Munich Reinsurance America, Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. and Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation, all of which have A.M. Best insurer financial strength ratings of A(Excellent) or A+(Superior). Our property catastrophe program is subscribed through a broker by reinsurers from the United States, Bermuda, London and the European markets.
Primary components of the 2010 property and casualty reinsurance program include:  Property       per risk treaty  The primary purpose of the property treaty is to provide       capacity up to $25million, adequate for the majority of the risks we       write. It also includes protection for extra-contractual liability       coverage losses. We retain the first $5 million of each loss. Losses       between $5million and $25million are reinsured at 100 percent.       The ceded premium is estimated at $36million for 2010, compared with       $35million in 2009 and $37 million in   2008.
Casualty       per occurrence treaty  The casualty treaty provides capacity up to       $25million. Similar to the property treaty, it provides sufficient       capacity to cover the vast majority of casualty accounts we insure and       also includes protection for extra-contractual liability coverage losses.       We retain the first $6million Page 79 of each loss. Losses between $6million and $25 million are reinsured at 100percent. The ceded premium is estimated at $38 million in 2010, compared with $38million in 2009 and $43million in2008.
Casualty       excess treaties  We purchase a casualty reinsurance treaty that provides       an additional $25million in protection for certain casualty losses.       This treaty, along with the casualty per occurrence treaty, provides a       total of $50 million of protection for workers compensation,       extra-contractual liability coverage and clash coverage losses, which       would apply when a single occurrence involves multiple policyholders of       The Cincinnati Insurance Companies or multiple coverages for one insured.       The ceded premium is estimated at $2million in 2010, similar to the       premium we paid in 2009.
We purchase a second casualty excess treaty, which provides an additional $20 million in casualty loss coverage. This treaty also provides catastrophic coverage for workers compensation and extra-contractual liability coverage losses. The ceded premium is estimated at $1 million for 2010, similar to the premium we paid in 2009.
Property       catastrophe treaty  To protect against catastrophic events such as wind       and hail, hurricanes or earthquakes, we purchase property catastrophe       reinsurance with a limit up to $500million. For the       2010treaty, ceded premiums are estimated at $49 million, similar to       the $50 million in 2009 and $41million in 2008. We retain the first       $45million of any loss and varying shares of losses up to       $500million: o 34       percent of losses between $45 million and $70   million o 11       percent of losses between $70 million and $105   million o 10       percent of losses between $105 million and $200   million o 18       percent of losses between $200 million and $300   million o 10       percent of losses between $300 million and $400   million o 9       percent of losses between $400 million and $500   million After reinsurance, our maximum exposure to a catastrophic event that caused $500 million in covered losses would be $104 million compared with $118 million in 2009. The largest catastrophe loss in our history was Hurricane Ike in September 2008, which was estimated to be $145 million before reinsurance at December 31, 2009. The treaty contains one reinstatement provision.
Individual risks with insured values in excess of $25 million, as identified in the policy, are handled through a different reinsurance mechanism. We typically reinsure property coverage for individual risks with insured values between $25 million and $65 million under an automatic facultative treaty. For risks with property values exceeding $65 million, we negotiate the purchase of facultative coverage on an individual certificate basis. Forcasualty coverage on individual risks with limits exceeding $25 million, facultative reinsurance coverage is placed on an individual certificate basis.
Terrorism coverage at various levels has been secured in most of our reinsurance agreements. The broadest coverage for this peril is found in the property and casualty working treaties, which provide coverage for commercial and personal risks. Our property catastrophe treaty provides coverage for personal risks, and coverage for commercial risks with total insured values of $10million or less. For insured values between $10 million and $25 million, there also may be coverage in the property working treaty.
A form of reinsurance is also provided through The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). TRIA was originally signed into law on November26,2002, and extended on December22, 2005, in a revised form, and extended again on December26,2007. TRIA provides a temporary federal backstop for losses related to the writing of the terrorism peril in property casualty insurance policies. TRIA now is scheduled to expire December31,2014. Under regulations promulgated under this statute, insurers are required to offer terrorism coverage for certain lines of property casualty insurance, including property, commercial multi-peril, fire, ocean marine, inland marine, liability, aircraft and workers compensation. In the event of a terrorism event defined by TRIA, the federal government would reimburse terrorism claim payments subject to the insurers deductible. The deductible is calculated as a percentage of subject written premiums for the preceding calendar year. Our deductible in 2009 was $383million (20percent of 2008subject premiums), and we estimate it is $369million (20percent of 2009subject premiums) in2010.
Reinsurance protection for the companys surety business is covered under separate treaties with many of the same reinsurers that write the property casualty working treaties.
The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, which began issuing insurance policies in 2008, has separate property and casualty reinsurance treaties for 2010 through Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation. Primary components of the treaties include:  Property       per risk treaty  The property treaty provides limits up to $5 million,       which is adequate capacity for the risk profile we insure. We retain the       first $1 million of any policy loss. Losses between $1 million and $5       million are reinsured at 100 percent.
Page 80  Casualty       treaties  The casualty treaties are written on a quota share basis and       provide limits up to $5million, which is adequate capacity for the       risk profile we insure. The maximum exposure for any one casualty loss is       $1 million.
Basket       retention  The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company has       purchased this coverage to limit our retention to $1 million in the event       that the same occurrence results in both a property and a casualty       loss.
Property       catastrophe treaty  As a subsidiary of The Cincinnati Insurance Company,       The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company has been added as       a named insured under our corporate property catastrophe treaty. All terms       and conditions of this treaty apply to policies underwritten by The       Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance   Company.
For property or casualty risks with limits exceeding $5 million, underwriters place facultative reinsurance coverage on an individual certificate basis. The combined property and casualty treaty provides protection on a participating basis for extra contractual obligations, as well as exposure to losses in excess of policy limits. Thelimit is $5 million for both property and casualty.
Cincinnati Life, our life insurance subsidiary, purchases reinsurance under separate treaties with many of the same reinsurers that write the property casualty working treaties. In 2005, we modified our reinsurance protection for our term life insurance business due to changes in the marketplace that affected the cost and availability of reinsurance for term life insurance. We are retaining no more than a $500,000 exposure, ceding the balance using excess over retention mortality coverage, and retaining the policy reserve. Retaining the policy reserve has no direct impact on GAAP results. However, because of the conservative nature of statutory reserving principles, retaining the policy reserve unduly depresses our statutory earnings and requires a large commitment of our capital. We also have catastrophe reinsurance coverage on our life insurance operations that reimburses us for covered net losses in excess of $9 million. Our recovery is capped at $75 million for losses involving our associates. For term life insurance business written prior to 2005, we retain 10percent to 25percent of each term policy, not to exceed $500,000, ceding the balance of mortality risk and policy reserve.
Safe Harbor Statement This is our Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report. Some of those risks and uncertainties are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, Page 23. Although we often review or update our forward-looking statements when events warrant, we caution our readers that we undertake no obligation to do so.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:  Unusually       high levels of catastrophe losses due to risk concentrations, changes in       weather patterns, environmental events, terrorism incidents or other       causes  Increased       frequency and/or severity of claims  Inadequate       estimates or assumptions used for critical accounting       estimates  Recession       or other economic conditions resulting in lower demand for insurance       products or increased payment delinquencies  Delays       in adoption and implementation of underwriting and pricing methods that       could increase our pricing accuracy, underwriting profit and       competitiveness  Inability       to defer policy acquisition costs for any business segment if pricing and       loss trends would lead management to conclude that segment could not       achieve sustainable profitability  Declines       in overall stock market values negatively affecting the companys equity       portfolio and bookvalue  Events,       such as the credit crisis, followed by prolonged periods of economic       instability or recession, that leadto: o Significant       or prolonged decline in the value of a particular security or group of       securities and impairment of the asset(s) o Significant       decline in investment income due to reduced or eliminated dividend payouts       from a particular security or group of   securities o Significant       rise in losses from surety and director and officer policies written for       financialinstitutions  Prolonged       low interest rate environment or other factors that limit the companys       ability to generate growth in investment income or interest rate       fluctuations that result in declining values of fixed-maturity       investments, including declines in accounts in which we hold bank-owned       life insurance contract assets  Increased       competition that could result in a significant reduction in the companys       premium volume Page 81  Changing       consumer insurance-buying habits and consolidation of independent       insurance agencies that could alter our competitive     advantages  Inability       to obtain adequate reinsurance on acceptable terms, amount of reinsurance       purchased, financial strength of reinsurers and the potential for       non-payment or delay in payment by reinsurers  Events       or conditions that could weaken or harm the companys relationships with       its independent agencies and hamper opportunities to add new agencies,       resulting in limitations on the companys opportunities for growth, such       as: o Multi-notch       downgrades of the companys financial strength   ratings o Concerns       that doing business with the company is too   difficult o Perceptions       that the companys level of service, particularly claims service, is no       longer a distinguishing characteristic in the   marketplace o Delays       or inadequacies in the development, implementation, performance and       benefits of technology projects and enhancements  Actions       of insurance departments, state attorneys general or other regulatory       agencies, including a change to a federal system of regulation from a       state-based system, that: o Restrict       our ability to exit or reduce writings of unprofitable coverages or lines       of business o Place       the insurance industry under greater regulatory scrutiny or result in new       statutes, rules andregulations o Increase       our expenses o Add       assessments for guaranty funds, other insurance related assessments or       mandatory reinsurance arrangements;

Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as recent measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. Theultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.
Item       7A.
Quantitative       and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Introduction Market risk is the potential for a decrease in securities value resulting from broad yet uncontrollable forces such as: inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions or other widespread unpredictable events. It is comprised of many individual risks that, when combined, create a macroeconomic impact. The company accepts and manages risks in the investment portfolio as part of the means of achieving portfolio objectives. Some of the risks are:  Political        the potential for a decrease in value due to the real or perceived       impact of governmental policies   orconditions  Regulatory        the potential for a decrease in value due to the impact of legislative       proposals or changes in laws or regulations Page 82  Economic        the potential for a decrease in value due to changes in general economic       factors (recession, inflation, deflation, etc.)  Revaluation        the potential for a decrease in value due to a change in relative value       (change in market multiple) of the market brought on by general economic       factors  Interest-rate        the potential for a decrease in value of a security or portfolio due to       its sensitivity to changes (increases or decreases) in the general level       of interest rates  Company-specific       risk  the potential for a particular issuer to experience a decline in       value due to the impact of sector or market risk on the holding or because       of issues specific to the firm  Fraud        the potential for a negative impact on an issuers performance due to       actual or alleged illegal or improper activity of individuals it       employs  Credit        the potential for deterioration in an issuers financial profile due to       specific company issues, problems it faces in the course of its operations       or industry-related issues  Default        the possibility that an issuer will not make a required payment       (interest payment or return of principal) on its debt. Generally this       occurs after its financial profile has deteriorated (credit risk) and it       no longer has the means to make its payments The investment committee of the board of directors monitors the investment risk management process primarily through its executive oversight of our investment activities. We take an active approach to managing market and other investment risks, including the accountabilities and controls over these activities. Actively managing these market risks is integral to our operations and could require us to change the character of future investments purchased or sold or require us to shift the existing asset portfolios to manage exposure to market risk within acceptable ranges.
Sector risk is the potential for a negative impact on a particular industry due to its sensitivity to factors that make up market risk. Market risk affects general supply/demand factors for an industry and affects companies within that industry to varying degrees.
Risks associated with the five asset classes described in Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 18, can be summarized as follows (H  high, A  average, L  low): Taxable fixed maturities Tax-exempt fixed maturities Common equities Preferred equities Short-term investments Political A H A A L Regulatory A A A A L Economic A A H A L Revaluation A A H A L Interest       rate H H A H L Fraud A L A A L Credit A L A A L Default A L A A L Fixed-Maturity Investments For investment-grade corporate bonds, the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices leads to falling bond values during periods of increasing interest rates. We address this risk by attempting to construct a generally laddered maturity schedule that allows us to reinvest cash flows at prevailing rates. Although the potential for a worsening financial condition, and ultimately default, does exist with investment-grade corporate bonds, we address this risk by performing credit analysis and monitoring as well as maintaining a diverse portfolio of holdings.
The primary risk related to high-yield corporate bonds is credit risk or the potential for a deteriorating financial structure. A weak financial profile can lead to rating downgrades from the credit rating agencies, which can put further downward pressure on bond prices. Interest rate risk, while significant, is less of a factor with high-yield corporate bonds, as valuation is related more directly to underlying operating performance than to general interest rates. This puts more emphasis on the financial results achieved by the issuer rather than on general economic trends or statistics within the marketplace. We address this concern by analyzing issuer- and industry-specific financial results and by closely monitoring holdings within this asset class.
The primary risks related to tax-exempt bonds are interest rate risk and political risk associated with the specific economic environment within the political boundaries of the issuing municipal entity. We address these concerns by focusing on municipalities general-obligation debt and on essential-service bonds. Essential-service bonds derive a revenue stream from municipal services that are vital to the people living in the area (water service, sewer service, etc.). Another risk related to tax-exempt bonds is regulatory risk or the potential for legislative changes that would negate the benefit of owning tax-exempt bonds. We monitor regulatory activity for situations that may negatively affect current holdings and our ongoing strategy for investing in these securities.
Page 83 The final, less significant risk is our exposure to credit risk for a portion of the tax-exempt portfolio that has support from corporate entities. Examples are bonds insured by corporate bond insurers or bonds with interest payments made by a corporate entity through a municipal conduit/authority. Our decisions regarding these investments primarily consider the underlying municipal situation. The existence of third-party insurance is intended to reduce risk in the event of default. In circumstances in which the municipality is unable to meet its obligations, risk would be increased if the insuring entity were experiencing financial duress. Because of our diverse exposure and selection of higher-rated entities with strong financial profiles, we do not believe this is a material concern as we discuss in Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 18.
Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Because of our strong surplus, long-term investment horizon and ability to hold most fixed-maturity investments to maturity, we believe the company is well positioned if interest rates were to rise. A higher rate environment would provide the opportunity to invest cash flow in higher-yielding securities, while reducing the likelihood of untimely redemptions of currently callable securities. While higher interest rates would be expected to continue to increase the number of fixed-maturity holdings trading below 100percent of book value, we believe lower fixed-maturity security values due solely to interest rate changes would not signal adecline in credit quality.
Our dynamic financial planning model uses analytical tools to assess market risks. Aspart of this model, the effective duration of the fixed-maturity portfolio is continually monitored by our investment department to evaluate the theoretical impact of interest rate movements.
The table below summarizes the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the fixed-maturityportfolio: Interest       Rate Shift in Basis Points (In       millions) -200 -100 0 100 200 At       December 31, 2009 $ 8,705 $ 8,279 $ 7,855 $ 7,428 $ 7,024 At       December 31, 2008 $ 6,467 $ 6,143 $ 5,827 $ 5,506 $ 5,202 The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 5.3 years at year-end 2009, compared with 5.4years at year-end 2008. A100 basis point movement in interest rates would result in an approximately 5.3percent change in the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio. Generally speaking, the higher a bond is rated, the more directly correlated movements in its fair value are to changes in the general level of interest rates, exclusive of call features. The fair values of average- to lower-rated corporate bonds are additionally influenced by the expansion or contraction of credit spreads.
In the dynamic financial planning model, the selected interest rate change of 100 to 200 basis points represents our views of a shift in rates that is quite possible over a one-year period. The rates modeled should not be considered a prediction of future events as interest rates may be much more volatile in the future. Theanalysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in rates on our results or financial condition, nor does it take into account any actions that we might take to reduce exposure to suchrisks.
Short-Term Investments Our short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper, demand notes or bonds purchased within one year of maturity. We make short-term investments primarily with funds to be used to make upcoming cash payments, such as taxes. At year-end 2009, short-term investments included $5million that was frozen in TheReserves Primary Fund. This amount was received in early 2010.
Equity Investments Common stocks are subject to a variety of risk factors encompassed under the umbrella of market risk. General economic swings influence the performance of the underlying industries and companies within those industries. As we saw in 2008, adownturn in the economy can have a negative effect on an equity portfolio. Industry- and company-specific risks also have the potential to substantially affect the value of our portfolio. We implemented new investment guidelines in 2008 to help address these risks by diversifying the portfolio and establishing parameters to help manage exposures.
Our equity holdings represented $2.701 billion in fair value and accounted for approximately 66.8 percent of the unrealized appreciation of the entire portfolio at year-end 2009. See Item 1, Investments Segment, Page 18, for additional details on our holdings.
The primary risks related to preferred stocks are similar to those related to investment grade corporate bonds. Falling interest rates adversely affect market values due to the normal inverse relationship between rates and yields. Credit risk exists due to the subordinate position of preferred stocks in the capital structure. We minimize this risk by primarily purchasing investment grade preferred stocks of issuers with a strong history of paying a common stock dividend.
Page 84 Application Of Asset Impairment Policy As discussed in Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Asset Impairment, Page 42, our fixed-maturity and equity investment portfolios are evaluated differently for other-than-temporary impairments. The companys asset impairment committee monitors a number of significant factors for indications that the value of investments trading below the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The application of our impairment policy resulted in other-than-temporary impairment charges that reduced our income before income taxes by $131 million in 2009, $510 million in 2008 and $16 million in 2007. Impairments are discussed in Item7, Investment Results of Operations, Page64.
Weexpect the number of securities trading below 100percent of book value to fluctuate as interest rates rise or fall and credit spreads expand or contract due to prevailing economic conditions. Further, book values for some securities have been revised due to impairment charges recognized in prior periods. At year-end 2009, 355of the 2,505 securities we owned were trading below 100 percent of book value compared with 944 of the 2,233 securities we owned at year-end 2008 and 373 of the 2,053 securities we owned at year-end 2007.
The 355holdings trading below book value at year-end 2009 represented 16.8percent of invested assets and $84million in unrealized losses.
311       of these holdings were trading between 90 percent and 100 percent of book       value. The value ofthese securities fluctuates primarily because of       changes in interest rates. Thefair value of these       311securities was $1.613billion at year-end 2009, and they       accounted for $51million in   unrealizedlosses.
35       of these holdings were trading between 70 percent and 90 percent of book       value. The fair value of these holdings was $168 million, and they       accounted for $30million in unrealized losses. These securities,       which are being closely monitored, have been affected by a combination of       factors including wider credit spreads driven primarily by the distress in       the mortgage market, slumping real estate valuations, the effects of a       slowing economy and the effects of higher interest rates on longer       duration instruments. The majority of these securities are in the       financial-related sectors.
9       securities, all fixed-maturity, were trading below 70 percent of book       value at year-end 2009. The fair value of these holdings was $5 million,       and they accounted for $3 million in unrealized losses. The real estate       sector accounted for 63 percent and the financial sector for 37 percent of       the unrealized losses.

Financial       Statements and Supplementary Data Responsibility For Financial Statements We have prepared the consolidated financial statements of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and our subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2009, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
We are responsible for the integrity and objectivity of these financial statements. The amounts, presented on an accrual basis, reflect our best estimates and judgment. These statements are consistent in all material aspects with other financial information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our accounting system and related internal controls are designed to assure that our books and records accurately reflect the companys transactions in accordance with established policies and procedures as implemented by qualified personnel.
Our board of directors has established an audit committee of independent outside directors. We believe these directors are free from any relationships that could interfere with their independent judgment as audit committee members.
The audit committee meets periodically with management, our independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors to discuss how each is handling responsibilities. The audit committee reports its findings to the board of directors. The audit committee recommends to the board the annual appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee reviews with this firm the scope of the audit assignment and the adequacy of internal controls and procedures.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, audited the consolidated financial statements of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and subsidiaries for the year ended December31,2009. Its report is on Page 89. Deloittes auditors met with our audit committee to discuss the results of their examination. They have the opportunity to discuss the adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting without management present.
Page 87 Managements Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Thecompanys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain       to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and       fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the       company;  Provide       reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit       preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that       receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance       with authorizations of management and the directors of the company;       and  Provide       reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of       unauthorized acquisition, useor disposition of the companys assets       that could have a material effect on the financial     statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary overtime.
The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Managements assessment was based on the criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. The assessment led management to conclude that, as of December 31, 2009, the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
The companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. This report appears on Page 89.
/S/ Kenneth W. Stecher Kenneth W. Stecher President and Chief Executive Officer /S/ Steven J. Johnston Steven J. Johnston, FCAS, MAAA, CFA Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer February 26, 2010 Page 88 Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Cincinnati Financial Corporation Fairfield, Ohio We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(c). We also have audited the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2009, based on criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (UnitedStates). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, thecompanys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of thecompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, thefinancial position of the company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and theircash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments in 2009.

Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and our wholly owned subsidiaries. We present our statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of America (GAAP). In consolidating our accounts, we have eliminated intercompany balances andtransactions.
In accordance with GAAP, we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report and discuss in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from our estimates.
Earnings per Share Net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each of the respective years. We calculate net income per common share (diluted) assuming the exercise of stock-based awards. We have adjusted shares and earnings per share to reflect all stock splits and dividends prior to December 31, 2009.
Share-Based Compensation We grant qualified and non-qualified share-based compensation under authorized plans. The stock options vest ratably over three years following the date of grant and are exercisable over 10-year periods. In 2008, the committee approved a mix of stock options and restricted stock units for stock-based awards. Stock options granted had similar terms but generally were awarded for fewer shares compared with previous years to accommodate new awards of service-based and performance-based restricted stock units.
Employee Benefit Pension Plan We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that was modified during 2008. We froze entry into the pension plan, and only participants 40 years of age or older could elect to remain in the plan. Our pension expense is based on certain actuarial assumptions and also is composed of several components that are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. Refer to Note13, Employee Retirement Benefits, Page109 for more information regarding our defined benefit pension plan.
Property Casualty Insurance Property casualty written premiums are deferred and recorded as earned premiums on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. We record as unearned premiums the portion of written premiums that applies to unexpired policy terms. The expenses associated with issuing insurance policies  primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting costs  are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies. Our standard market insurance operations consist of two segments, commercial lines and personal lines. We assess recoverability of deferred acquisition costs at the segment level, consistent with the ways we acquire, service and manage insurance and measure profitability. We also have deferred acquisition costs in our surplus lines operation, which is reported in Other. We analyze our acquisition cost assumptions periodically to reflect actual experience; we evaluate our deferred acquisition cost for recoverability; and we regularly conduct reviews for potential premium deficiencies.
A premium deficiency is recorded when the sum of expected loss and loss adjustment expenses, expected policyholder dividends, unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds the total of unearned premiums and anticipated investment income. A premium deficiency is first recognized by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required to eliminate the deficiency. If the premium Page 94 deficiency is greater than unamortized acquisition costs, a liability is accrued for the excess deficiency. We did not record a premium deficiency for the three years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007.
Certain property casualty policies are not booked before the effective date. An actuarial estimate is made to determine the amount of unbooked written premiums. The majority of the estimate is unearned and does not have a material impact on earned premium.
Effective in the second quarter 2009, we changed our presentation of underwriting expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We have summarized commissions, insurance operating expenses, increase in deferred acquisition costs and taxes, licenses and fees to a single caption, Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses.
We establish reserves to cover the expected cost of claims, or losses, and our expenses related to investigating, processing and resolving claims. Although determining the appropriate amount of reserves is inherently uncertain, we base our decisions on past experience and current facts. Reserves are based on claims reported prior to the endof the year and estimates of unreported claims. We take into account the fact that we may recover some of ourcosts through salvage and subrogation. We regularly review and update reserves using the most current information available. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current year insurance losses and policyholderbenefits.
The consolidated property casualty companies actively write property casualty insurance through independent agencies in 37states. Our10largest states generated 68.1 percent and 68.7 percent of total earned premiums in 2009 and 2008. Ohio, our largest state, accounted for 21.0 percent and 20.9percent of total earned premiums in 2009 and 2008. Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia each accounted for between 4 percent and 9 percent of total earned premiums in 2009. Our largest single agency relationship accounted for approximately 1.2percent of the company's total earned premiums in2009. Our largest reinsurer, Swiss Reinsurance Company, accounted for 21.5 percent of total ceded earned premiums.
Policyholder Dividends Certain workers compensation policies include the possibility of a policyholder earning a return of a portion of its premium in the form of a policyholder dividend. The dividend generally is calculated by determining the profitability of a policy year along with the associated premium. We reserve for all probable future policyholder dividend payments.
Life and Health Insurance We offer several types of life and health insurance, and we account for each according to the duration of the contract. Short-duration contracts are written to cover claims that arise during a short, fixed term of coverage. We generally have the right to change the amount of premium charged or cancel the coverage at the end of each contract term. Group life insurance is an example. We record premiums for short-duration contracts similarly to property casualty contracts.
Long-duration contracts are written to provide coverage for an extended period of time. Traditional long-duration contracts require policyholders to pay scheduled gross premiums, generally not less frequently than annually, over the term of the coverage. Premiums for these contracts are recognized as revenue when due. Whole life insurance and disability income insurance are examples. Some traditional long-duration contracts have premium payment periods shorter than the period over which coverage is provided. For these contracts, the excess of premium over the amount required to pay expenses and benefits is recognized over the term of the coverage rather than over the premium payment period. Ten-pay whole life insurance is an example.
We establish a liability for traditional long-duration contracts as we receive premiums. The amount of this liability is the present value of future expenses and benefits less the present value of future net premiums. Netpremium is the portion of gross premium required to provide for all expenses and benefits. We estimate future expenses and benefits and net premium using assumptions for expected expenses, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal rates and investment income. We include a provision for deviation, meaning we allow for some uncertainty in making our assumptions. We establish our assumptions when the contract is issued and we generally maintain those assumptions for the life of the contract. We use both our own experience and industry experience, adjusted for historical trends, in arriving at our assumptions for expected mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates. We use our own experience and historical trends for setting our assumption for expected expenses. We base our assumption for expected investment income on our own experience, adjusted for current economic conditions.
When we issue a traditional long-duration contract, we capitalize acquisition costs. Acquisition costs are coststhat vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new business. We then charge these deferredpolicy acquisition costs to expenses over the premium-paying period of the contract, and we use the sameassumptions that we use when we establish the liability for the contract. We update our acquisition cost assumptions periodically to reflect actual experience, and we evaluate our deferred acquisition cost forrecoverability.
Page 95 Universal life contracts are long-duration contracts for which contractual provisions are not fixed, unlike whole life insurance. Universal life contracts allow policyholders to vary the amount of premium, within limits, without our consent. However, we may vary the mortality and expense charges, within limits, and the interest crediting rate used to accumulate policy values. We do not record universal life premiums as revenue. Instead we recognize as revenue the mortality charges, administration charges and surrender charges when received. Some of our universal life contracts assess administration charges in the early years of the contract that are compensation for services we will provide in the later years of the contract. These administration charges are deferred and are recognized over the period when we provide those future services.
For universal life long-duration contracts, we maintain a liability equal to the policyholder account value. There is no provision for adverse deviation. Some of our universal life policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. For these policies, we establish a reserve in addition to the account balance, based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.
When we issue a universal life long-duration contract, we capitalize acquisition costs. We then charge these capitalized costs to expenses over the term of coverage of the contract. When we charge deferred policy acquisition costs to expenses, we use assumptions based on our best estimates of long-term experience. Wereview and modify these assumptions on a regular basis.
Effective in the second quarter 2009, we changed our presentation of underwriting expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We have summarized commissions, insurance operating expenses, increase in deferred acquisition costs and taxes, licenses and fees to a single caption, Underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses.
Separate Accounts We issue life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to as bank-owned life insurance contracts (BOLIs). We legally segregate and record as separate accounts the assets and liabilities for some of our BOLIs, based on the specific contract provisions. We guarantee minimum investment returns, account values and death benefits for our separate account BOLIs. Our other BOLIs are general account products.
We carry the assets of separate account BOLIs at fair value. The liabilities on separate account BOLIs primarily are the contract holders claims to the related assets and are carried at an amount equal to the contract holders account value. At December 31, 2009, the current fair value of the BOLI invested assets and cash exceeded the current fair value of the contract holders account value by approximately $7million. If the BOLI projected fair value were to fall below the value we guaranteed, a liability would be established by a charge to the companys earnings.
Generally, investment income and realized investment gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contract holder, and we do not include them in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues and expenses related to separate accounts consist of contractual fees and mortality, surrender and expense risk charges. Also, each separate account BOLI includes a negotiated gain and loss sharing arrangement with the company. A percentage of each separate accounts realized gain and loss representing contract fees and assessments accrues to us and is transferred from the separate account to our general account and is recognized as revenue or expense.
Reinsurance We reduce risk and uncertainty by buying property casualty and life reinsurance. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our duty to policyholders, but rather help protect our financial strength to perform that duty. All of our reinsurance contracts transfer the economic risk of loss.
We also serve in a limited way as a reinsurer for other insurance companies, reinsurers and involuntary state pools. We record our transactions for such assumed reinsurance based on reports provided to us by the ceding reinsurer.
Reinsurance assumed and ceded premiums are deferred and recorded as earned premiums on a pro rata basis over the terms of the contract. Weestimate loss amounts recoverable from our reinsurers based on the reinsurance policy terms. Historically, our claims with reinsurers have been paid. We do not have an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid instruments that include liquid debt instruments with original maturities of less than three months. These are carried at cost and approximate fair value.
Investments Our portfolio investments are primarily in publicly traded fixed-maturity, equity and short-term investments. Fixed-maturity investments (taxable bonds, tax-exempt bonds, redeemable preferred stocks and collateralized mortgage obligations) and equity investments (common and non-redeemable preferred stocks) are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial Page 96 statements. The number of fixed-maturity securities trading below 100percent of book value can be expected to fluctuate as interest rates rise or fall. Because of our strong surplus and long-term investment horizon, our general intent is to hold fixed-maturity investments until maturity, regardless of short-term fluctuations in fair values.
On April 1, 2009, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (OTTI). Our invested asset impairment policy states that fixed maturities the company (1)intends to sell or (2) are more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery of their amortized cost basis are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The book value of any such securities is reduced to fair value as the new cost basis, and a realized loss is recorded in the period in which it is recognized. When these two criteria are not met, and the company believes that full collection of interest and/or principal is not likely, we determine the net present value of future cash flows by using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition as the discount rate and compare that amount to the amortized cost and fair value of the security. The difference between the net present value of the expected future cash flows and amortized cost of the security is considered a credit loss and recognized as a realized loss in the period in which it occurred. The difference between the fair value and the net present value of the cash flows of the security, the non-credit loss, is recognized in other comprehensive income as an unrealized loss. With the adoption of this ASC in the second quarter of 2009, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $106 million, net of tax, to reclassify the non-credit component of previouslyrecognized impairments by increasing retained earnings and reducing accumulated other comprehensive income.
ASC 320 does not allow retrospective application of the new other-than-temporary impairment model. OurConsolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December31,2009, are not measured on the same basis as prior period amounts and, accordingly, these amounts are notcomparable.
When determining OTTI charges for our equity portfolio, our invested asset impairment policy considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including facts and circumstances specific to individual securities, asset classes, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in dividend payment, the length of time fair value had been less than book value, the severity of the decline in fair value below book value, the volatility of the security and our ability and intent to hold each position until its forecasted recovery.
Included within our other invested assets are life policy loans, venture capital fund investments and investment in real estate. Life policy loans are carried at the receivable value. We use the equity method of accounting for venture capital fund investments. The venture capital funds provide their financial statements to us and generally report investments on their balance sheets at fair value. Investment in real estate consists of one office building that is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
We include the non-credit portion of fixed maturities and all other unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on investments are recognized in net income based on the trade date accounting method.
Investment income consists mainly of interest and dividends. We record interest on an accrual basis and record dividends at the ex-dividend date. We amortize premiums and discounts on fixed-maturity securities using the effective interest method over the expected life of the security.
Fair Value Disclosures We account for our investment portfolio at fair value and apply fair value measurements as defined by ASC820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to financial instruments. Fair value is applicable to ASC320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 825, FinancialInstruments.
We adopted the provisions of Fair Value Measurements on January 1, 2008. Fair Value Measurements defines fair value as the exit price or the amount that would be (1) received to sell an asset or (2) paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. When determining an exit price we must, whenever possible, rely upon observable market data. Weprimarily base fair value for investments in equity and fixed-maturity securities (including redeemable preferred stock and assets held in separate accounts) on quoted market prices or on prices from FTInteractive Data, an outside resource that supplies global securities pricing, dividend, corporate action and descriptive information to support fund pricing, securities operations, research and portfolio management. When a price is not available from these sources, as in the case of securities that are not publicly traded, we determine the fair value using various inputs including quotes from independent brokers. The fair value of investments not priced by FT Interactive Data is less than 1 percent of the fair value of our total investmentportfolio.
For the purpose of ASC 825 disclosure, we estimate the fair value for liabilities of investment contracts and annuities. We also estimate the fair value for assets arising from policyholder loans on insurance contracts. These estimates are developed using discounted cash flow calculations across a wide range of economic interest rate scenarios with a provision for our own credit risk. We base fair value for long-term senior notes Page 97 on the quoted market prices for such notes. We base fair value for notes payable on our year-end outstanding balance.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities We account for derivative financial instruments as defined by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The hedging definitions included in ASC 815 guide our recognition of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments as realized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity in the period for which theyoccur.
Securities Lending Program During the third quarter of 2008, we terminated our securities lending program.
Lease/Finance Our leasing subsidiary provides auto and equipment direct financing (leases and loans) to commercial and individual clients. We generally transfer ownership of the property to the client as the terms of the leases expire. Our lease contracts contain bargain purchase options. We record income over the financing term using the effective interest method.
We capitalize and amortize lease or loan origination costs over the life of the financing using the effective interest method. These costs may include, but are not limited to: finder fees, broker fees, filingfees and the cost of credit reports. We account for these leases and loans as direct financing-typeleases.
Land, Building and Equipment We record building and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. Certain equipment held under capital leases also is classified as property and equipment with the related lease obligations recorded as liabilities. Our depreciation is based on estimated useful lives (ranging from three years to 39years) using straight-line and accelerated methods. Depreciation expense was $48 million in 2009, $35million in 2008, and $38 million in 2007. We monitor land, building and equipment for potential impairments. Potential impairments may include a significant decrease in the fair values of the assets, considerable cost overruns on projects or a change in legal factors or business climate, or other factors that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no recorded land, building and equipment impairments for 2009, 2008 or 2007.
We capitalize and amortize costs for internally developed computer software during the application development stage. These costs generally consist of external consulting, payroll and payroll-relatedcosts.
Income Taxes We calculate deferred income tax liabilities and assets using tax rates in effect for the time when temporary differences in book and taxable income are estimated to reverse. We recognize deferred income taxes for numerous temporary differences between our taxable income and book-basis income and other changes in shareholders equity. Such temporary differences relate primarily to unrealized gains and losses on investments and differences in the recognition of deferred acquisition costs and insurance reserves. We charge deferred income taxes associated with unrealized appreciation and depreciation (except the amounts related to the effect of income tax rate changes) to shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. We charge deferred taxes associated with other differences to income.
There are no amounts in our ASC 740 liability that would change the effective tax rate if recognized. Although no penalties currently are accrued, if incurred, they would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest expense is recognized as other interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Subsequent Events There were no subsequent events requiring adjustment to the financial statements or disclosure.
Pending Accounting Standards  In       January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and       Disclosures. ASU2010-06 applies to all entities that are required to       make disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements.       ASU 2010-06 requires separate disclosures of the activity in the Level 3       category related to any purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a       gross basis. The effective date of the disclosures regarding level 3       category purchases, sales, issuances and settlements are for interim and       annual periods ending after December 15, 2010. The portion of ASU 2010-06       that has not yet been adopted will not have a material impact on our       companys financial position, cash flows or results of operations as it       focuses on additional disclosures.
Page 98 Adopted Accounting Standards  In       December 2008, the FASB issued ASC 715-20-65-2, Employers Disclosures       about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. ASC 715-20-65-2 is an amendment       of ASC 715-20, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other       Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of ASC 715-10, 715-30, and 715-60.       ASC715-20-65-2 provides guidance on an employers disclosures about       plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The       effective date of this ASC is the companys fiscal year ending after       December15, 2009. We adopted this standard; however, it did not have       an impact on our companys financial position, cash flows or results       ofoperations as it focuses on additional   disclosures.
In       April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 820-10-50, Interim Disclosures about Fair       Value of Financial Instruments. ASC 820-10-50 is an amendment of ASC       825-10-50, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments and ASC       270, Interim Financial Reporting. ASC 820-10-50 expands the fair value       disclosures for all financial instruments within the scope of ASC       825-10-50 to interim reporting periods. We have adopted ASC 820-10-50, and       it is effective for interim reporting periods ending after       June15,2009. It did not have an impact on our companys       financial position, cash flows or results of operations as it focuses on       additional disclosures.
In       April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 320, Recognition and Presentation of       Other-Than-Temporary Impairments effective for interim and annual       reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. ASC 320 is an amendment of       ASC 320-10, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity       Securities and ASC 958-320, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by       Not-for-Profit Organizations. ASC 320 amends the other-than-temporary       impairment guidance for debt securities and expands the presentation and       disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity       securities in the financial statements. We adopted this ASC as of April 1,       2009.
In       April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 820-10-65-4, Determining Fair Value When       the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have       Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly.       ASC 820-10-65-4 is an amendment of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements.       ASC 820-10-65-4 applies to all assets and liabilities and provides       guidance on measuring fair value when the volume and level of activity has       significantly decreased and guidance on identifying transactions that are       not orderly. ASC 820-10-65-4 requires interim and annual disclosures of       the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a       discussion of changes in valuation techniques and related inputs, if any,       that occurred during the period. We have adopted thisASC, which is       effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after       June15,2009. It did not have a material impact on our       companys financial position, cash flows or results       ofoperations.
In       May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855, Subsequent Events. ASC 855 provides       guidance on the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet       date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be       issued. The date through which any subsequent events have been evaluated       and the basis for that date must be disclosed. ASC 855 requires that we       disclose the analysis of subsequent events through the date that our       Financial Statements are issued. ASC 855 also defines the circumstances       under which an entity should recognize such events or transactions and the       related disclosures of such events or transactions that occur after the       balance sheet date. We adopted this ASC, which is effective for interim or       annual financial periods ending after June15,2009. It did not       have an impact on our companys financial position, cash flows or results       ofoperations.
In       June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 105, The FASB Accounting Standards       Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting       Principlesa replacement of FASB Statement No. 162. ASC105       establishes a single source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. GAAP,       except for rules and interpretive releases of theSEC. We have       adopted this ASC, which is effective for interim and annual reporting       periods ending after September15,2009. It did not have       animpact on our companys financial position, cash flows or results       of operations as it does not change authoritative   guidance.
In       August 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-05, Measuring Liabilities at Fair       Value. ASU 2009-05 is an amendment of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and       Disclosures. ASU 2009-05 applies to all entities that measure liabilities       at fair value within the scope of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and       Disclosures. ASU 2009-05 provides guidance on measuring fair value of       liabilities under circumstances in which a quoted price in an active       market for the identical liability is not available. We have       adoptedthis ASU, which is effective for the first interim or annual       reporting period beginning after August28,2009. It did not       have a material impact on our companys financial position, cash flows or       results ofoperations.
In       September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12, Investments in Certain       Entities That Calculate NetAsset Value per Share (or Its       Equivalent). ASU 2009-12 provides guidance on estimating fair value of       alternative investments when using the net asset value per share provided       by the investment entity. Wehave adopted thisASU, which is       effective for interim and annual periods ending after       December15,2009, with early adoption permitted. It did not       have a material impact on our companys financial position, cash flows or       results ofoperations.
Page 99  In       January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and       Disclosures. ASU2010-06 applies to all entities that are required to       make disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements.       ASU 2010-06 provides guidance on additional disclosures onany       significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and a description       of the transfer. ASU2010-06 also requires separate disclosures of       the activity in the Level 3 category related to any purchases, sales,       issuances and settlements on a gross basis. The effective date of the new       disclosures relating to the existing disclosures regarding Level 1 and       Level 2 categories is for interim and annual periods ending after December       15, 2009. We have adopted the portion of ASU 2010-06 related to       significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2. The effective       date of the disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances and       settlements to the Level 3 category is for interim and annual periods       ending after December 15,2010. The portion of ASU 2010-06 that has       been adopted did not have a materialimpact on our companys       financial position, cash flows or results of operations as it focuses on       additionaldisclosures.

At year-end 2008 and 2007 our largest stock holding made up 14.5percent and 28.1percent of the publicly traded common stock portfolio, respectively. We also diversified our investment portfolio as a result of the fourth-quarter 2009 Pfizer acquisition of Wyeth (NYSE:WYE). In addition to receiving approximately $146 million in cash for our Wyeth shares, we sold approximately 2.4 million shares of Pfizer subsequent to the merger. As a result of these transactions, our stock portfolio exposure tothe healthcare sector reduced to 18.0 percent at December 31,2009, from 24.6percent at September30,2009.

At December 31, 2009, 121 fixed-maturity investments with a total unrealized loss of $25 million had been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Of that total, eightfixed maturity investments were trading below 70 percent of book value with a total unrealized loss of $2million. Ten equity investments with a total unrealized loss of $26 million had been in an unrealized loss position for 12months or more as of December 31, 2009. Of that total, no equity investments were trading below 70 percent of book value.
During 2008, we impaired 126 securities. At December 31, 2008, 142 fixed-maturity investments with a total unrealized loss of $78 million had been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. Of that total, no fixed-maturity investments were trading below 70 percent of book value. Six equity investments with a total unrealized loss of $41 million had been in an unrealized loss position for 12months or more as of December31,2008, with two trading below 70 percent of book value. As a result of this evaluation, we did not record impairment on the sixequity securities in an unrealized loss position in excess of 12 months at December31, 2008.
During 2007, we impaired 20 securities. At December 31, 2007, 184 fixed-maturity investments with a total unrealized loss of $20 million had been in an unrealized position for 12 months or more. Three of these securities were trading below 70 percent of book value with a total unrealized loss of $6 million. There were no equities trading below book value for 12 months or more.
When determining OTTI charges for our fixed-maturity portfolio, management places significant emphasis on whether issuers of debt are current on contractual payments and whether future contractual amounts are likely to be paid. As required by the new accounting standard for fixed-maturity securities, our invested asset impairment policy states that OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if we intend to sell the impaired fixed maturity security; (2) if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell, the book value of any such securities is reduced to fair value as the new cost basis, and a realized loss is recorded in the period in which it is recognized. When we believe that full collection of interest and/or principal is not likely, we determine the net present value of future cash flows by using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition as the discount rate and compare that amount to the amortized cost and fair value of the security. The difference between the net present value of the expected future cash flows and amortized cost of the security is considered a credit loss and recognized as a realized loss in the period in which it occurred. The difference between the fair value and the net present value of the cash flows of the security, the non-credit loss, is recognized in other comprehensive income as an unrealizedloss.
With the adoption of ASC 320 in the second quarter of 2009, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $106 million, net of tax, to reclassify the non-credit component of previouslyrecognized impairments by increasing retained earnings and reducing accumulated other comprehensive income. ASC 320 does not allow retrospective application of the new OTTI model. Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2009, are not measured on the same basis as prior period amounts and, accordingly, these amounts are not comparable.
When determining OTTI charges for our equity portfolio, our invested asset impairment policy considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including facts and circumstances specific to individual securities, asset classes, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in dividend payment, the length of time fair Page 102 value had been less than book value, the severity of the decline in fair value below book value, the volatility of the security and our ability and intent to hold each position until its forecasted recovery.
For each of our equity securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2009, we applied the objective quantitative and qualitative criteria of our invested asset impairment policy for OTTI. Our long-term equity investment philosophy, emphasizing companies with strong indications of paying and growing dividends, combined with our strong surplus, liquidity and cash flow, provides us the ability to hold these investments through what we believe to be slightly longer recovery periods occasioned by the recession and historic levels of market volatility. Each quarter we review the expected recovery period for each individual security. Based on the individual qualitative and quantitative factors, as discussed above, we evaluate and determine an expected recovery period for each security. A change in the condition of a security can warrant impairment before the expected recovery period. If the security has not recovered cost within the expected recovery period, the security is impaired.
3.Fair Value Measurements Fair Value Hierarchy In accordance with fair value measurements and disclosures, we categorized our financial instruments, based on the priority of the observable and market-based data for valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices with readily available independent data in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable market inputs (Level 3). Our valuation techniques have not changed from December31,2008, and ultimately management determines fair value.
When various inputs for measurement fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest observable input that has a significant impact on fair value measurement is used.
Financial instruments are categorized based upon the following characteristics or inputs to the valuationtechniques:  Level       1  Financial assets and liabilities for which inputs are observable and       are obtained from reliable quoted prices for identical assets or       liabilities in actively traded markets. This is the most reliable fair       value measurement and includes, for example, active exchange-traded equity       securities.
Level       2  Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted       prices in markets that are not active or for which values are based on       similar assets and liabilities that are actively traded. This also       includes pricing models for which the inputs are corroborated by market       data.
Level       3  Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices       or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and       significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 inputs include       the following: o Quotes       from brokers or other external sources that are not considered       binding; o Quotes       from brokers or other external sources where it can not be determined that       market participants would in fact transact for the asset or liability at       the quoted price; o Quotes       from brokers or other external sources where the inputs are not deemed       observable.
We conduct a thorough review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Reclassification of certain financial instruments may occur when input observability changes. As noted below in the Level3 disclosure table, reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassification occurred.
The following tables illustrate the fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods ended December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008. We do not have any material liabilities carried at fair value. There were also no significant transfers between Level 1 or Level 2.

The actuarial estimateis subject to review and adjustment by an inter-departmental committee that includes actuarial management and is familiar with relevant company and industry business, claims, and underwriting trends, as well as general economic and legal trends, that could affect future loss and loss expensepayments.
Because of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years, we decreased the provision for loss and loss expenses by $188million, $323 million and $244 million in calendar years 2009, 2008 and 2007. These decreases are partly due to the effects of settling reported (case) and unreported (IBNR) reserves established in prior years for amounts less than expected. The reserve for loss and loss expenses in the consolidated balance sheets also includes $46 million for both 2009 and 2008, and $42million at December 31, 2007, for certain life and health losses.
6.Life Policy Reserves We establish the reserves for traditional life insurance policies based on expected expenses, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal rates and investment yields, including a provision for uncertainty. Once these assumptions are established, they generally are maintained throughout the lives of the contracts. Weuseboth our own experience and industry experience, adjusted for historical trends, in arriving at our assumptions for expected mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates as well as for expected expenses. Webase our assumptions for expected investment income on our own experience adjusted for current economic conditions.
We establish reserves for the companys universal life, deferred annuity and investment contracts equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. Some of our universal life policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. For these policies, weestablish a reserve in addition to the account balance, based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.
Page 105 Here is a summary of our life policy reserves: At       December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Ordinary/traditional       life $ 579 $ 528 Universal       life 450 442 Deferred       annuities 539 374 Investment       contracts 197 195 Other 18 12 Total $ 1,783 $ 1,551 Reserves for deferred annuities and other investment contracts were $736 million and $569 million for December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively. Fair value for these deferred annuities and investment contracts was $737million and $460 million for December 31, 2009, and December31,2008, respectively. Fair values of liabilities associated with certain investment contracts are calculated based upon internally developed models because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. To determine the fair value, we make the following significant assumptions: (1) the discount rates used to calculate the present value of expected payments are the risk-free spot rates plus an A3rated bond spread for financial issuers as of December 31, 2009, to account for non-performance risk; (2) the rate of interest credited to policyholders is the portfolio net earned interest rate less a spread for expenses and profit; and (3) additional lapses occur when the credited interest rate is exceeded by an assumed competitor credited rate, which is a function of the risk-free rate of the economic scenario being modeled. The fair value of life policy loans outstanding principal and interest approximated $44million, compared with book value of $40million reported in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009.
7.Notes Payable At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had two lines of credit with commercial banks with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $225million. Our note payable balance, which approximates fair value, was $49million at year-end 2009 and at year-end 2008. The $75 million line of credit expires August of 2010. The $150 million line of credit with a $49million balance expires July of 2012. We had no compensating balance requirements on short-term debt for either 2009 or 2008. Interest rates charged on borrowings ranged from 2.58percent to 6.86percent during 2009.
8.Senior Debt This table summarizes the principal amounts of our long-term debt excluding unamortized discounts: (In       millions) At       December 31, Interest rate Year of issue 2009 2008 6.900% 1998 Senior       debentures, due 2028 $ 28 $ 28 6.920% 2005 Senior       debentures, due 2028 391 392 6.125% 2004 Senior       notes, due 2034 374 375 Total $ 793 $ 795 The fair value of our senior debt approximated $740 million at year-end 2009 compared with $595million at year-end 2008. Fair value for 2009 and 2008 was determined under ASC 820 based on market pricing of these or similar debt instruments that are actively trading. Fair value can vary with macro economic concerns. Regardless of the fluctuations in fair value, the outstanding principal amount of our long-term debt was reduced slightly from year-end 2008. None of the notes are encumbered by rating triggers.
9.Shareholders Equity And Dividend Restrictions Our insurance subsidiary declared dividends to the parent company of $50 million in 2009, $160million in 2008 and $420 million in 2007. State regulatory requirements restrict the dividends insurance subsidiaries can pay. Generally, the most our insurance subsidiaries can pay without prior regulatory approval is the greater of 10 percent of policyholder surplus or 100 percent of statutory net income for the prior calendaryear. Dividends exceeding these limitations may be paid only with approval of the insurance department of the domiciliary state. During 2010, the total dividends that our lead insurance subsidiary may pay to our parent company without regulatory approval is approximately $365million.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets at December31 were asfollows: At       December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Deferred       tax assets: Loss       and loss expense reserves $ 182 $ 196 Unearned       premiums 104 107 Investments 40 121 Other 31 41 Total 357 465 Deferred       tax liabilities: Unrealized       gains on investments and derivatives (332 ) (182 ) Deferred       acquisition costs (152 ) (149 ) Other (25 ) (8 ) Total (509 ) (339 ) Net       deferred tax (liability) asset $ (152 ) $ 126 The provision for federal income taxes is based upon filing a consolidated income tax return for the company and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, we had no operating or capital loss carryforwards.
The differences between the 35 percent statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate were asfollows: Years       ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Tax       at statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Increase       (decrease) resulting from: Tax-exempt       municipal bonds (6.5 ) (6.2 ) (2.7 ) Dividend       received exclusion (3.4 ) (8.9 ) (4.7 ) Other 0.6 0.8 0.7 Effective       rate 25.7 % 20.7 % 28.3 % ASC 740, Income Taxes As a result of positions taken in our 2008 federal tax return filed with the IRS, we believe it is more likely than not that tax positions for which we previously carried a liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be sustained upon examination by the IRS.
Below is the unrecognized tax benefit for the years ended December 31: (In       millions) 2009 2008 2007 Gross       unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, $ 2 $ 14 $ 25 Gross       increase in prior year positions 0 3 0 Gross       decrease in prior year positions (2 ) 0 (12 ) Gross       increase in current year positions 0 2 1 Settlements       with tax authorities 0 (17 ) 0 Gross       unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, $ 0 $ 2 $ 14 In May 2008, the IRS concluded the examination phase of its audit of our 2005 and 2006 tax years and presented us with adjustments primarily related to the valuation of our loss reserves. In October2008, we reached agreement with the IRS settling all issues related to the 2005 and 2006 tax years. As a result of the IRS agreement for tax years 2005 and 2006, management refined certain assumptions used to calculate the unrecognized tax benefits associated with loss reserves, resulting in a revised measurement of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008.
The IRS has begun the audit of tax years 2007 and 2008. It is reasonably possible that a change in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may occur once the examination phase of this audit has concluded. At this time, we can neither estimate the settlement date of, nor quantify an estimated range for any potential change to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to these years.
Page 108 In addition to our IRS filings, we file income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. Material amounts of income tax are paid to Ohio, Illinois and Florida. In December 2009, the State of Illinois began an income tax audit of amended returns for tax years 2002 through 2006 as well as an audit of the return filed for tax year2007. Although we have not yet been presented with the final examination reports for any of these years, we do not expect any material changes as a result of the Illinois audits. With the exception of Illinois, no other state audits are currently under way nor are we aware of any audits pending. Excluding years under examination by Illinois, tax years 2006 and forward remain open for state examination.
12.Net Income Per Common Share Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. We have adjusted shares and earnings per share to reflect all stock splits and dividends prior to December 31, 2009.
Here are calculations for basic and diluted earnings per share: Years       ended December 31, (In millions except per share       data) 2009 2008 2007 Numerator: Net       incomebasic and diluted $ 432 $ 429 $ 855 Denominator: Weighted-average       common shares outstanding 162,595,041 163,150,329 170,595,204 Effect       of stock based awards 271,822 212,080 1,572,248 Adjusted       diluted weighted-average shares 162,866,863 163,362,409 172,167,452 Earnings       per share: Basic $ 2.66 $ 2.63 $ 5.01 Diluted 2.65 2.62 4.97 Number       of anti-dilutive stock based awards 9,875,411 9,781,652 1,870,579 Exercise       price of anti-dilutive stock based awards $ 25.08-45.26 $ 25.08-45.26 $ 44.79-45.26 The current sources of dilution of our common shares are certain equity-based awards as discussed in Note17 Stock-Based Associate Compensation Plans, Page 113. The above table shows the number of anti-dilutive stock-based awards at year-end 2009, 2008 and 2007. We did not include these stock-based awards in the computation of net income per common share (diluted) because their exercise would have anti-dilutive effects.
13.Employee Retirement Benefits We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan (401(k) savings plan). During 2008, we changed the form of retirement benefit we offer some associates to a company match on contributions to the 401(k) plan from the defined benefit pension plan. We froze entry into the pension plan for new associates during 2008. Only participants 40 years of age or older could elect to continue to participate. For participants remaining in the pension plan, we continue to contribute to fund future benefit obligations. Benefits for the defined benefit pension plan are based on years of credited service and compensation level. Contributions are based on the prescribed method defined in the Pension Protection Act. Our pension expense is based on certain actuarial assumptions and also is composed of several components that are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.
We also maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) with liabilities of approximately $5million at year-end 2009 and $6 million at year-end 2008. TheSERP is included in the obligation and expense amounts in the tables below. The company also makes available to a select group of associates the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Top Hat Savings Plan, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
For any participant who left the pension plan, benefit accruals were frozen during 2008. We transferred $60million of the pension plans accumulated benefit obligation during 2008 to an intermediary spin-off plan to facilitate the partial curtailment and settlement for these participants. For SERP participants who chose to leave the defined benefit pension plan, benefit accruals were frozen in the SERP as of December 31, 2008. During 2009, the frozen accrued benefit for those participants, collectively amounting to approximately $1million, transferred to the Top Hat Savings Plan. Beginning in 2009, for these associates, the company has begun matching deferrals to the Top Hat Savings Plan up to the first 6 percent of an associates compensation that exceeds the compensation limit specified by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Pursuant to ASC 715-30 we recognized expense of $3million during 2008 in the consolidated statement of income associated with the partial termination of the qualified pension plan. In addition, we recognized $27million in the consolidated statement of income during 2008 for a settlement loss associated with the payout to the participants who left the pension plan of the obligation held in their behalf. Included in the charge is the contribution of $24million to complete funding of benefits that were distributed in 2008 to participants leaving the pension plan.
Page 109 Matching contributions to our sponsored 401(k) plan, which we began making during 2008, totaled $7million and $3million during the years 2009 and 2008. Associates who are not accruing benefits under the pension plan are eligible to receive the company match of up to 6percent of cash compensation. We also pay all operating expenses for the 401(k)plan. Participants vest in the company match for the 401(k)plan and Top Hat Savings Plan after three years of eligible service.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assumptions Key assumptions used in developing the 2009 net pension obligation were a 6.10percent discount rate and rates of compensation increases ranging from 4.00percent to 6.00percent. To determine the discountrate, the plans particular liability characteristics  the amounts, timing and interest sensitivity of expected benefit payments  were evaluated and then matched to a yield curve based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across a full maturity spectrum. Once the plans projected cash flows matched theyield curve, a present value was developed, which was then calibrated to a single-equivalent discount rate. Thatdiscount rate, when applied to a single sum, would generate the necessary cash flows to pay benefits when due. We increased the rate by 0.10percentage points due to market interest rate conditions at year-end 2009. We based the rates of compensation increase on the companys historical data.
Key assumptions used in developing the 2009 net pension expense were a 6.00percent discount rate, an8.00percent expected return on plan assets and rates of compensation increases ranging from 4.00percent to 6.00percent. The 8.00 percent return on plan assets assumption is consistent with current expectations of inflation and based partially on the fact that our common stock holdings pay dividends. We believe this rate is representative of the expected long-term rate of return on these assets. These assumptions were consistent with the prior year, except that the discount rate was decreased by 0.25percentage points due to market interest rate conditions at the beginning of the year.
Here is a summary of the weighted-average assumptions we use to determine our net expense for theplan: Qualified       Pension Plan SERP 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Discount       rate 6.00 % 6.25 % 5.75 % 6.00 % 6.25 % 5.75 % Expected       return on plan assets 8.00 8.00 8.00 n/a n/a n/a Rate       of compensation increase 4-6 4-6 4-6 4-6 4-6 4-6 Benefit obligation activity using an actuarial measurement date for our qualified plan and SERP at December31 follows: At       December 31, (In       millions) 2009 2008 Change       in projected benefit obligation: Benefit       obligation at beginning of year $ 206 $ 270 Service       cost 10 14 Interest       cost 12 17 Actuarial       loss 2 21 Benefits       paid (7 ) (11 ) Curtailment 0 (27 ) Settlement (2 ) (78 ) Projected       benefit obligation at end of year $ 221 $ 206 Accumulated       benefit obligation $ 186 $ 170 Change       in plan assets: Fair       value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 118 $ 210 Actual       return on plan assets 0 (36 ) Employer       contributions 33 33 Benefits       paid (7 ) (11 ) Settlement 0 (78 ) Fair       value of plan assets at end of year $ 144 $ 118 Unfunded       status: Unfunded       status at end of year $ (77 ) $ (88 ) Page 110 A reconciliation follows of the funded status for our qualified plan and SERP at the end of the measurement period to the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31: At       December 31, (In       millions) 2009 2008 Amounts       recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consists of: Pension       liability $ (77 ) $ (88 ) Total $ (77 ) $ (88 ) Amounts       recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income       not yet recognized as a component of net periodic       benefit costs consist of: Net       actuarial loss $ 63 $ 47 Prior       service cost 3 5 Total $ 66 $ 52 The weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for our qualified plan and SERP at December 31 follows: AtDecember31, 2009 2008 Discount       rate 6.10 % 6.00 % Rate       of compensation increase 4-6 4-6 We evaluate our pension plan assumptions annually and update them as necessary. The discount rate assumptions for our benefit obligation track with high grade corporate bond yields and yearly adjustments reflect any changes to those bond yields. Compensation increase assumptions reflect historical calendar year compensation increases.
Here are the components of our net periodic benefit cost, as well as other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for our qualified plan and SERP at December31: Years       ended December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Service       cost $ 10 $ 14 $ 17 Interest       cost 12 17 16 Expected       return on plan assets (12 ) (16 ) (15 ) Amortization       of actuarial loss, prior service cost and transition asset 1 2 3 Curtailment 0 3 0 Settlement 0 27 0 Net       periodic benefit cost $ 11 $ 47 $ 21 YearsendedDecember31, (Inmillions) 2009 2008 2007 Current       year actuarial loss (gain) $ 15 $ 73 $ (10 ) Recognition       of actuarial (loss) gain 0 (54 ) (1 ) Recognition       of prior service cost (1 ) (4 ) (1 ) Total       recognized in other comprehensive income $ 14 $ 15 $ (12 ) The total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income was $25million, $62million and $9 million for the periods ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The estimated costs to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next year for our plans are a $2 million actuarial loss and a $1 million prior service cost.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets The pension plan assets are managed to maximize total return over the long term while providing sufficient liquidity and current return to satisfy the cash flow requirements of the plan. The plans day-to-day investment decisions are managed by our internal investment department; however, overall investment strategies are agreed upon by our employee benefits committee.
Reflecting the long-term time horizon of pension obligations, during 2009 we allocated 60percent to 65percent of the pension portfolio to domestic equity investments, which are priced from highly observable and actively traded markets. The remainder of the portfolio is allocated to domestic fixed-maturity investments and cash. Our corporate bond portfolio is investment grade. The plan does not engage in derivative transactions.
Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year. Investments in securities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Investments in securities that are not Page 111 actively traded are valued based on pricing models which the inputs have been corroborated by market data at December31, 2009 and 2008.
The plan, which ultimately determines fair value, categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of the observable and market-based data for valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices with readily available independent data in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable market inputs (Level 3).
When various inputs for measurement fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest observable input that has a significant impact on fair value measurement is used.
Refer to Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, Page 103 for valuation techniques and categorization of financial instruments within the pension plan assets. The methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.
The following table illustrates the fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for period ended December 31, 2009. The pension plan does not have any assets categorized as Level3. During 2008, plan assets held were 83 percent equity securities, 4 percent fixed maturities and 13percent cash and cash equivalents.

The defined benefit pension plan did not purchase or sell any shares of our common stock during 2009 and 2008. The company paid $1million in cash dividends on our common stock to the pension plan in both 2009 and2008.
In 2010, we expect to contribute $25 million to our qualified plan. We expect to make the following benefit payments for our qualified plan and SERP, reflecting expected futureservice: (Inmillions) YearsendedDecember31, FortheyearsendedDecember31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015-2019 Expected       future benefit payments $ 12 $ 17 $ 19 $ 16 $ 15 $ 115 14.
Statutory       Accounting Information (Unaudited) Insurance companies use statutory accounting practices (SAP) as prescribed by regulatory authorities. The primary differences between SAP and GAAP include:  valuation       of unrealized investment gains and losses,  expensing       of policy acquisition costs,  actuarial       assumptions for life insurance reserves and  deferred       income taxes based on differences in statutory and taxable       income.
Statutory net income and capital and surplus as determined in accordance with SAP prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities for four legal entities, our insurance subsidiary and its three insurance subsidiaries, are as follows: SAPNetIncome(Loss) CapitalandSurplus YearsendedDecember31, AtDecember31, (Inmillions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 The       Cincinnati Insurance Company $ 339 $ 194 $ 658 $ 3,648 $ 3,360 The       Cincinnati Casualty Company 29 16 12 254 263 The       Cincinnati Indemnity Company 8 2 1 67 66 The       Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company (7 ) (38 ) 0 168 174 The       Cincinnati Life Insurance Company 15 (70 ) 39 300 290 Page 112 Statutory capital and surplus for our insurance subsidiary, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, includes capital and surplus of its four insurance subsidiaries.

Transactions       With Affiliated Parties We paid certain officers and directors, or insurance agencies of which they are shareholders, commissions of approximately $6 million, $6 million and $7 million on premium volume of approximately $36 million, $38million and $37million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Commitments       And Contingent Liabilities In the ordinary course of conducting business, the company and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in various legal proceedings. Most of these proceedings are claims litigation involving the companys insurance subsidiaries in which the company is either defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds who are litigating first-party coverage claims. The company accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. We believe that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, is immaterial to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The company and its subsidiaries also are occasionally involved in other legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, improper reimbursement of medical providers paid under workers compensation insurance policies, erroneous coding of municipal tax locations and excessive premium charges for uninsured motorist coverage. The companys insurance subsidiaries also are occasionally parties to individual actions in which extra-contractual damages, punitive damages or penalties are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insuranceclaims.
On a quarterly basis, we review the outstanding lawsuits seeking such recourse. Based on our year-end review, webelieve we have valid defenses to each. As a result, we believe the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, is immaterial to our consolidated financialposition.
Nonetheless, given the potential for large awards in certain of these actions and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations or cash flows.
17.
Stock-Based       Associate Compensation Plans We currently have four equity compensation plans that together permit us to grant various types of equity awards. We currently grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, service-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units under our shareholder-approved plans. We also have a Holiday Stock Bonus Plan that permits annual awards of one share of common stock to each full-time associate for each year of service up to a maximum of 10 shares. One of our equity compensation plans permits us to grant stock to our outside directors as a component of their annual compensation.
We use the modified-prospective-transition method under which we recognize our pretax and after-tax share-based compensation costs, which are summarized below: YearsendedDecember31, (Inmillions) 2009 2008 2007 Stock-based       compensation cost $ 10 $ 15 $ 14 Income       tax benefit 3 4 3 Stock-based       compensation cost after tax $ 7 $ 11 $ 11 Options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2009, had no intrinsic value. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December31,2008 and 2007 was $1 million and $8million, respectively. (Intrinsic value is the market price less the exercise price.) Options vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, had no intrinsic value.
As of December31,2009, we had $11 million of unrecognized total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock unit awards. That cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.
Stock options are granted to associates at an exercise price that is equal to the fair value as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the grant date and are exercisable over 10-year periods. The stock options generally vest ratably over a three-year period. In determining the share-based compensation amounts, we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model. We make assumptions in four areas to develop the binomial option-pricing model:  Weighted-average       expected term is based on historical experience of similar awards with       consideration for current exercise trends.
Page 113  Expected       volatility is based on our stock price over a historical period that       approximates the expectedterm.
Dividend       yield is determined by dividing the per share dividend by the stock price       on the date of grant.
Risk-free       rates are the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues       with a remaining term approximating the expected   term.
During 2009, we issued our common stock to eligible associates under our Holiday Stock Bonus Plan. No stock options, service-based or performance-based restricted stock units were granted to associates during 2009. The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants issued during 2008 and 2007 in determining fair value of share-based compensation: 2009 2008 2007 Weighted       - average expected term n/a 7-9       years 5-7       years Expected       volatility n/a 20.58-28.52% 18.29       - 24.14% Dividend       yield n/a 3.99-6.22% 3.33% Risk-free       rates n/a 3.29-3.84% 4.8-4.81% Weighted-average       fair value of options granted during the period n/a $       6.50 $       9.43 Here is a summary of options information: (Dollars       in millions, shares in thousands) Shares Weighted- average exercise Aggregate intrinsic value 2009 Outstanding       at beginning of year 10,789 $ 36.31 Granted 0 0.00 Exercised (2 ) 27.83 Forfeited (912 ) 32.47 Outstanding       at end of year 9,875 36.67 $ 12 Options       exercisable at end of period 8,711 $ 36.99 $ 4 Cash received from the exercise of options was less than $1 million, $4 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

AtDecember31,2009, 7.7 million shares were available for future issuance under the plans. During the second quarter of 2009, our shareholders approved the Directors Stock Plan of 2009, which authorizes 300,000 shares to be granted to our directors. During 2009, we granted 23,944 shares of common stock under the expiring plan to our directors for 2008 board service fees. Wecurrently issue new shares or use treasury shares for stock-based compensation award issues or exercises.
Restricted Stock Units Service-based and performance-based restricted stock units are granted to associates at fair value of the shares on the date of grant less the present value of the dividends that holders of restricted stock units will not receive on the shares underlying the restricted stock units during the vesting period. Service-based restricted stock units cliff vest three years after the date of grant.
If certain performance targets are attained, performance-based restricted stock units vest on the first day of March after a three-calendar-year performance period. Quarterly, management reviews and determines the likelihood that the company will achieve the performance targets for the outstanding groups of performance-based restricted stockunits.
As of December 31, 2009, management assumed that performance targets used for restricted stock unit awards granted during November 2008 would be met, and we recognized related compensation cost.
Page 114 Management concluded that the company would not meet performance targets for all other performance-based restricted stock unit awards and did not recognize related compensation costs.

Segment       Information We operate primarily in two industries, property casualty insurance and life insurance. We regularly review four different reporting segments to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance:  Commercial       lines property casualty insurance  Personal       lines property casualty insurance  Life       insurance  Investment       operations We report as Other the non-investment operations of the parent company and its non-insurer subsidiaries, CFCInvestment Company and CSU Producers Resources Inc. We also report as Other the results of The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, as well as other income of our standard market property casualty insurance subsidiary. Also included in 2009, 2008 and 2007 results for this segment are the operations of a former subsidiary, CinFinCapital Management.
Revenues come primarily from unaffiliated customers:  All       three insurance segments record revenues from insurance premiums earned.       Life insurance segment revenues also include separate account investment       management fees.
Our       investment operations revenues are pretax net investment income plus       realized investment gains and losses.
Other       revenues are primarily finance/lease income and, for 2009 and 2008, earned       premiums from The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance       Company.
Income or loss before income taxes for each segment is reported based on the nature of that business areas operations:  Income       before income taxes for the insurance segments is defined as underwriting       income or loss.
o For       commercial lines and personal lines insurance segments, we calculate       underwriting income or loss by recording premiums earned minus loss and       loss expenses and underwriting expenses   incurred.
o For       the life insurance segment, we calculate underwriting income or loss by       recording premiums earned and separate account investment management fees,       minus contract holders benefits and expenses incurred, plus investment       interest credited to contract holders.
Income       before income taxes for the investment operations segment is net       investment income plus realized investment gains and losses for       investments of the entire company, minus investment interest credited to       contract holders of the life insurance segment.
Loss       before income taxes for the Other category is primarily due to interest       expense from debt of the parent company, operating expenses of our       headquarters and, for 2009 and 2008, loss and loss expenses and       underwriting expenses from The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance       Company.
Identifiable assets are used by each segment in its operations. We do not separately report the identifiable assets for the commercial or personal lines segments because we do not use that measure to analyze the segments. We include all investment assets, regardless of ownership, in the investment operationssegment.

* Revenues       include realized investment gains and losses, which are integral to our       financial results over the long term may cause this value to fluctuate       substantially because we have substantial discretion in the timing of       investment sales. Also, applicable accounting standards require us to       recognize gains and losses from certain changes in fair values of       securities and embedded derivatives without actual realization of those       gains and losses. We discuss realized investment gains for the past three       years in Item 7, Investments Results of Operations,       Page64.

Controls       and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  The company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)).
Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

Based upon that evaluation, the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that:  information       required to be disclosed in the companys reports under the Exchange Act       is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods       specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms,       and  such       information is accumulated and communicated to the companys management,       including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as       appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required       disclosures.
