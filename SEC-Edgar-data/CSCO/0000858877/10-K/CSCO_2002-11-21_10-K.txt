BUSINESS  GENERAL  Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Report"), including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projections," and words of similar import, constitute "forward-looking statements." Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Cisco's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including risks faced by the Company described in this Report, including the "Risk Factors" section contained in this Item 1, and the other documents Cisco files with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its most recent reports on Form 8-K and Form 10-Q, and amendments thereto.  Cisco Systems, Inc. (the "Company" or "Cisco") is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. Cisco Internet Protocol ("IP")-based networking solutions are the foundation of the Internet and are installed at corporations, public institutions, telecommunication companies, and are found in a growing number of medium-sized commercial enterprises. Cisco provides a broad line of solutions for transporting data, voice, and video within buildings, across campuses, or around the world. Cisco solutions allow networks, both public and private, to operate with flexibility, security, and performance.  The Company markets its products through its direct sales force, single and two-tier distributors, value-added resellers, service providers, and systems integrators. This multiple-channel approach allows customers to select the channel that addresses their specific needs and provides the Company with broad coverage of worldwide markets.  On April 16, 2001, due to macroeconomic and capital spending issues affecting the networking industry, the Company announced a restructuring program to prioritize its initiatives around high-growth areas of its business, focus on profit contribution, reduce expenses, and improve efficiency. This restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities, and restructuring of certain businesses. As a result of the restructuring program and decline in forecasted revenue, the Company recorded restructuring costs and other special charges and an additional excess inventory charge. For additional information regarding the restructuring program, see the section titled "Restructuring Costs and Other Special Charges and Provision for Inventory" on pages 17 to 19 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.  On August 23, 2001, Cisco announced several organizational changes designed to align the Company's focus around changing customer requirements and emphasize the Company's advantages as the communications market and industries consolidate. These changes include moving from the Company's existing line of business structure to centralized engineering and marketing organizations. The new engineering organization will focus on 11 new technology groups, while marketing will focus on communicating Cisco's unique technology differentiation.                                          3 4  Cisco was incorporated in California in December 1984 and is headquartered in San Jose. The mailing address for the Company's headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California, 95134-1706, and its telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. The Cisco Web site can be found at www.cisco.com.  END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS  Cisco is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. The Cisco strategy is to provide open, end-to-end, standards-based networking solutions to help customers improve productivity and gain a competitive advantage in the global economy. Cisco helps customers build their own network infrastructure while also providing tools to allow them to communicate with their customers, prospects, business partners, suppliers, and employees. An end-to-end networking solution allows network services to be consistently provided to all users on the network.  The Cisco product portfolio offers a broad range of end-to-end networking hardware, software, and services. Products are used individually or in combinations to connect computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other -- whether they are within a building, across a campus, or around the world. The Company's breadth of product offerings enables it to offer a wide range of solutions to meet customer requirements. Many of the Company's products are easily upgraded or expanded, offering customers the ability to extend their networks as their needs grow, while protecting their investments.  The Company also provides products and services that allow customers to transition their various data networks to a single multiservice data, voice, and video network.  Cisco's offerings fall into several categories:  Routing  Routing is a foundation technology for computer networking. Routers move information from one network to another, applying intelligence in the process to ensure that the information reaches its destination securely and in the most direct way possible. Cisco offers a broad range of routers that can be used in a large backbone infrastructure or a small office, including the Cisco 12000, 10000, 7600, 7400, and 7300 Series Internet Routers and the Cisco 3600, 2600, 2500, 1700, 1600, and 800 Series Internet Routers.  Switching  Switching is another important networking technology that is used in both local-area networks ("LANs") and wide-area networks ("WANs"). Cisco's switching strategy is designed to help users migrate from traditional shared LANs to fully switched networks by delivering products that support the varying levels of flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and high bandwidth required for today's desktop, workgroup, and backbone applications. Cisco solutions employ all widely used switching technologies -- Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode ("ATM"). The Cisco LAN switching products include the Catalyst(R) Family and its WAN switching products include the Cisco IGX(TM), Cisco BPX(R), and Cisco MGX(TM) Families.                                          4 5  Access  Today, people need remote access to the Internet or to a network that is used for a variety of personal, professional, or work-related applications. Cisco access solutions give remotely located groups and individuals similar levels of connectivity and information access, as if they were located at the company's head office or at home. Asynchronous and integrated services digital network ("ISDN") remote-access routers, dial-up access servers, digital subscriber line ("DSL") technologies, and cable universal broadband routers provide telecommuters, mobile workers, and students with remote network access. The Company's access products include the Cisco AS5000 Series Access Servers; the Cisco 6100 and 6200 lines of digital subscriber line access multiplexers ("DSLAMs"); the Cisco uBR7200 Series Universal Broadband Router cable head-end equipment; access routers such as the Cisco 3800, 3600, and 2600 Series Internet Routers; and network security and management software.  Customer Advocacy  Customer Advocacy ("CA") complements the Company's product offerings via a broad range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and maintenance support level services striving to ensure high availability networks and customer satisfaction. Cisco CA provides flexible service solutions such as 24x7 online and telephone support, onsite technical assistance center ("TAC") engineers, and more. Cisco CA helps customers transition to the Internet economy by enabling them to rapidly deploy new technologies, reduce and manage the risk associated with the deployment of new technologies, streamline business processes, and reduce operating costs.  Other  Other Cisco offerings include Internet services, network management software, and optical networking, among others, as follows:  Internet Service  Cisco offers end-to-end Internet services to improve a network manager's ability to cope with challenges posed by the growing popularity of the Internet, such as network traffic volume and network address shortages. Cisco drives architectural consistency across the company by focusing on standards-based services between clients and servers such as end-to-end quality of service ("QoS") and end-to-end security. These products include: Cisco Secure PIX(R) Firewall, which prevents unauthorized access to a network; the Cisco Secure Scanner, which scans the network for security risks; the Cisco Intrusion Detection System, which detects and responds to unauthorized activity or network attacks; Cisco Secure VPN Client 1.0, which ensures data privacy when accessing the network remotely; Cisco LocalDirector, Cisco Cache Engine, and Cisco DistributedDirector, which balance the load between multiple servers to enable timely access and to eliminate redundant Internet content; and the Cisco Server Suite 1000, which consists of server applications with a graphical user interface ("GUI").                                          5 6  Network Management Software  Cisco is extending its leading Internet business practices to its network management vision and products. One component of this initiative is CiscoWorks2000, a family of products based on Internet standards that enables enterprise customers to better control their large, complex, and heterogeneous networks and devices.  In order for service providers to profit from increasing new business opportunities, services must be carefully planned, quickly provisioned, efficiently operated, and accurately billed. The Cisco Service Management ("CSM") System is a network service and delivery management system that provides a modular suite of service management products integrated within a common and scalable infrastructure. CSM enables service providers to effectively deploy, monitor, and manage these new network services, while potentially increasing revenue and reducing cost.  Cisco also offers software solutions to expand the Company's technology offerings into messaging and call centers and extend Cisco's presence in the broader market for intelligent customer-contact software applications. These software applications allow end-users to unify voice-mail, e-mail, and fax traffic into a single mailbox accessible over an Internet-based network independent of location, time, or device. And, when calling in for customer support, users are connected to the best available customer service representative regardless of physical location.  Optical Networking  Cisco provides optical networking solutions through its Cisco ONS 15000 Series optical networking systems, which includes the ONS 15800 Series. The Cisco ONS 15000 Series enables multiservice networking and bandwidth management for scalable, data-optimized networks using dense wave division multiplexing ("DWDM") and SONET technology for metropolitan networks.  The following technologies are offered in conjunction with all of the above product categories:  Cisco AVVID  Cisco AVVID (Architecture for Voice, Video, and Integrated Data) provides an intelligent network infrastructure for Internet business solutions. As the industry's only enterprise-wide, standards-based network architecture, Cisco AVVID provides the roadmap for combining Cisco and its customers' business and technology strategies into one cohesive model. The Cisco AVVID architecture consists of several building blocks that deliver Internet business solutions -- network platforms, infrastructure, service control, and Internet business.  Cisco IOS Software  Cisco IOS(R) Software is a common networking software platform deployed across a broad spectrum of Cisco products. Cisco IOS Software delivers intelligent network services -- such as QoS, load-balancing, voice delivery, and multicast functions -- that enable customers to build a                                          6 7  flexible network infrastructure that is scalable, reliable, and secure. These intelligent network services also support Internet business solutions.  Among the emerging types of applications that require these features are on-demand media, electronic commerce services, real-time trading, and distance-learning activities. These applications form the foundation for new business models that increase competition, improve customer service, and enhance productivity.  CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS  Networking needs are influenced by a number of factors, including the size of the organization, number and types of computer systems, geographic location, and the applications requiring data communications. The Cisco customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry and in each of the past five fiscal years, no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company's net sales. For additional information regarding segment information for the Company, see Note 13, "Segment Information and Major Customers" on pages 43 to 45 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.  Cisco's customers are primarily in the following markets:  Large Enterprise Businesses  Enterprise customers generally are large organizations with 500 or more employees with complex networking needs, usually spanning multiple locations and types of computer systems. Enterprise customers include corporations, government agencies, utilities, and educational institutions.  Service Providers  These customers provide data, voice, and video communication services to businesses and consumers. They include regional, national, and international long distance telecommunications carriers, as well as Internet, cable, and wireless service providers.  Small and Medium-Sized Businesses  These customers have fewer than 500 employees and a need for networks of their own, as well as connection to the Internet and to business partners. However, these customers generally have limited resources and expertise in networking technology; therefore, the Company attempts to provide products that are affordable and easy to install and use.  Cisco also works to set standards for the consumer market through the Internet Home Alliance. This not-for-profit, open alliance was established based on a shared mission of making a difference through market collaboration and education.                                          7 8  CISCO SALES OVERVIEW  The Company's worldwide direct sales and marketing organization at July 28, 2001 consisted of approximately 15,000 individuals, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. The Company has field sales offices globally providing coverage throughout the world. Additionally, the Company's international sales are currently being made through multiple channels including international distributors, resellers, and direct sales throughout the world. The distributors provide system installation, technical support, and follow-up services to end-customers. Generally, the Company's international distributors have nonexclusive, countrywide agreements. For additional information regarding the Company's international sales, see Note 13, "Segment Information and Major Customers" on pages 43 to 45 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.  Cisco Systems Capital Corporation provides financing to certain qualified customers to be used for the purchase of equipment and other needs. For additional information regarding Cisco Systems Capital Corporation's financing activities, see Note 6, "Lease Receivables" on page 34 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.  ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES  The end-to-end networking strategy pursued by Cisco requires a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The combination of complexity and rapid change make it difficult for one company, no matter how large, to develop all technological solutions alone. Acquisitions, investments, and alliances are tools used by the Company to fill technical gaps in its offerings and enable it to deliver complete solutions to customers and prospects in its target markets. The Company's acquisitions have reinforced its commitment to providing an end-to-end networking solution.  Satisfying customers' networking needs requires a constant monitoring of market and technology trends, plus an ability to act quickly. Cisco employs one of the following strategies to satisfy the need for new or enhanced networking products and solutions: Develop new technologies and products internally; enter into joint-development efforts with other companies; resell another company's product; or acquire all or part of another company.  Since 1993, Cisco has acquired a number of companies. The Company expects to make future acquisitions where it believes that it can acquire new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that the Company's previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition or operating results. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1 of this Report.                                          8 9  MINORITY INVESTMENTS  The Company makes minority investments in companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to Cisco products or that support the Internet. By investing in new ventures, Cisco strengthens its partnerships with such companies. Together, Cisco and its partners can offer more complete solutions to the market.  STRATEGIC ALLIANCES  Cisco pursues strategic alliances with other industry leaders in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets. The objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: Technology exchange, product and solution development, joint sales and marketing, and new-market creation. To date, Cisco has entered into alliances with Callisma, Cap Gemini/Ernst & Young, Compaq, Hewlett Packard, Intel, IBM, Italtel, KPMG Consulting, Inc., Microsoft, Motorola, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Thrupoint, among others.  BACKLOG  The Company's backlog at September 14, 2001 was approximately $2.03 billion compared with a backlog of approximately $3.40 billion at September 25, 2000. The Company includes in its backlog only orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. During fiscal 2001, the Company changed its backlog policy to include products that will be shipped within 90 days from the previous policy of 120 days. Under the terms of the previous policy, the backlog at September 25, 2000 was approximately $3.83 billion. Because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders (which are made without significant penalty), the Company does not believe that its backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period.  COMPETITION  Cisco competes in the Internet infrastructure market, providing solutions for transporting data, voice, and video traffic across intranets, extranets, and the Internet. The market is characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a conversion to New World solutions that offer superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to Cisco. The Company competes with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of competitors providing niche product solutions may increase due to the market's long-term attractive growth. On the other hand, the Company expects the number of vendors supplying end-to-end networking solutions will decrease, due to consolidations in and accompanying economic pressure upon the industry. The Company believes its primary competition comes from nimble start-ups and young companies offering innovative niche solutions.  Cisco's competitors include Alcatel, Ciena, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Foundry Networks, Juniper, Lucent, Nortel Networks, Redback Networks, Siemens AG, and Sycamore Networks,                                          9 10  among others. Some of the Company's competitors compete across many of its product lines, while others do not offer as wide a breadth of solutions. Several of the Company's current and potential competitors have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than it does.  The principal competitive factors in the markets in which the Company presently competes and may compete in the future are:  -      The ability to provide end-to-end networking solutions and support  -      Performance  -      Price  -      The ability to provide new technologies and products  -      The ability to provide value-added features such as security,        reliability, and investment protection  -      Conformance to standards  -      Market presence  -      The ability to provide financing  The Company also faces competition from customers to whom it licenses technology and suppliers from whom it transfers technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, the Company must cooperate and at the same time compete with these companies. The Company's inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers, or the uncontrollable and unpredictable acts of others, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  The Company has enhanced and extended its product lines with new product and feature introductions in areas including data, voice, and video over IP; wireless access; dial access; enterprise switching; optical transport; storage networking; content networking; security; network management; advanced routing and switching technologies; DSL technologies; cable; and other broadband technologies, among others.  However, the industry in which Cisco competes is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, the Company's success, in part, depends upon its ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance its existing solutions and to develop and introduce new solutions that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. In order to achieve these objectives, the Company's management and engineering personnel work closely with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of inter-networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. The Company also expects to continue to make strategic acquisitions and equity investments where appropriate. The Company intends to remain dedicated to industry standards and to continue to support important protocol standards as they emerge. Still, there can be no assurance that Cisco will be able to successfully develop new products to address new customer requirements and                                          10 11  technological changes, or that such products will achieve market acceptance.  The Company's research and development expenditures were $3.92 billion, $2.70 billion, and $1.66 billion in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. All of the Company's expenditures for research and development costs, as well as in-process research and development of $855 million, $1.37 billion, and $471 million in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, have been expensed as incurred.  MANUFACTURING  The Company's manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials, components, and subassemblies. Additionally, the Company performs final assembly and test. The Company presently uses a variety of independent third-party companies to perform printed circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, and product repair. The Company and its supply partners install proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips installed in its systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables the Company to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements and provide turnkey solutions to its customers. The Company and its supply partners also use automated testing equipment and "burn-in" procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process control, to assure the quality and reliability of its products. The Company's and its partners' manufacturing processes and procedures are ISO 9001 or ISO 9003 certified.  PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND LICENSING  Cisco's success is dependent upon its proprietary technology. Cisco generally relies upon patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in its technology and products. Cisco has a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where a potential market for Cisco's products exists. Cisco has been issued a number of patents; other patent applications are currently pending. There can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to Cisco. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications, or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect Cisco's technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not permit the protection of Cisco's proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although Cisco believes the protection afforded by its patents, patent applications, copyrights, and trademarks has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry makes Cisco's future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of its employees rather than on patent, copyright, and trademark protection.  The industry in which Cisco competes is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to                                          11 12  Cisco. These claims have increased recently as a result of the Company's acquisitions of businesses and technologies. Such parties have pursued and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation against the Company or its manufacturers, suppliers, or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to the Company's existing or future products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical management personnel, or require Cisco to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against the Company by any third party is successful, or if the Company fails to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights, the Company's business could be materially and adversely affected.  Many of Cisco's products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, Cisco believes that based upon past experience and standard industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe patent rights of others. From time to time, Cisco receives notices from or is sued by third parties regarding patent infringement claims. If infringement claims are found to have merit, Cisco believes that, based upon industry practice, any necessary license or rights under such patents may be obtained on terms that would not have a material adverse effect on Cisco's business, operating results, or financial condition. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on Cisco's business, operating results, and financial condition.  EMPLOYEES  As of July 28, 2001, the Company employed approximately 38,000 persons, including 7,000 in manufacturing, service and support; 13,000 in engineering; 15,000 in sales and marketing; and 3,000 in finance and administration. Approximately 11,000 employees were in international locations. The Company considers the relationships with its employees to be positive. The Company has not experienced any work stoppages. Competition for technical personnel in the industry in which Cisco competes may be intense. The Company believes that its future success depends in part on its continued ability to hire, assimilate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, Cisco believes that the Company has been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in the future.                                          12 13  RISK FACTORS  Set forth below and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in the Report.  YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS  The results of operations for any quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Our operating results have in the past been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of a number of factors. These factors include:  -      Overall information technology spending  -      Changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in        the communications and networking industries  -      Fluctuations in demand for our products and services  -      The long sales and implementation cycle for our products and the reduced        visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue  -      Inventory levels exceeding our requirements based upon future demand        forecasts  -      Existing network capacity, sharing of existing network capacity, and        network capacity utilization rates of our customers  -      Price and product competition in the networking industry  -      The overall trend toward industry consolidation  -      The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products,        as well as the adoption of new networking standards  -      Variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold  -      The timing of orders, timing of shipments, and the ability to satisfy all        contractual obligations in customer contracts  -      Manufacturing lead times  -      The impact of acquired businesses and technologies  -      The geographical mix of our revenue and the associated impact on gross        margin  -      Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  -      Adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets  -      The ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund        capital expenditures  -      The trend toward sales of integrated network solutions  -      The timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employees'        gains on stock options exercised  As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, especially in recent periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.                                          13 14  In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any decision to limit investment in or to dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of accrued liabilities for special one-time charges, such as workforce reduction costs. Additionally, estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including goodwill and purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS  Our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the United States and globally, and, in particular, market conditions in the communications and networking industries. In recent quarters, our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In particular, sales to service providers, e-commerce and Internet businesses, and the manufacturing industry in the United States were adversely affected during fiscal 2001. If the economic conditions in the United States and globally do not improve, or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown, we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT  As a result of a variety of factors discussed herein, operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict. Our net sales may grow at a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and, in particular periods, may decline. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in certain of our recent quarters recurs in future periods. We generally have had at least one quarter of the fiscal year when backlog has been reduced. Although such reductions have not occurred consistently in recent years, they are difficult to predict and may occur in the future. In addition, in response to customer demand, we continue to attempt to reduce our product manufacturing lead times, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results going forward. On the other hand, for certain products, lead times are longer than our goal. If we cannot reduce manufacturing lead times for such products, our customers may place the same orders within our various sales channels, cancel orders, or not place further orders if shorter lead times are available from other manufacturers.  As a result of our growth in past periods, our fixed costs have increased. With increased levels of spending and the impact of long-term commitments, an inability to meet expected revenue levels in a particular quarter could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for that period as we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.  Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results. For example, from time to time, we have made acquisitions that result in in-process                                          14 15  research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter. These charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. Additionally, the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely affected if a number of large orders are either not received or are delayed, for example, due to cancellations, delays, or deferrals by customers.  WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN VARIABILITY OVER TIME  We expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs, higher inventory balances, obsolescence charges, loss of cost savings, price competition, and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold, in particular, optical and access products.  If product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have experienced, gross margin may be adversely affected. Our gross margin may also be adversely affected by geographic mix, as well as the mix of configurations within each product group. We continue to expand into third-party or indirect-distribution channels, which generally results in a lower gross margin. These distribution channels are generally given privileges to return inventory. In addition, increasing third-party and indirect-distribution channels generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products, and to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers.  We plan our operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels. Because these expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term, a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations.  WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY  Our growth and ability to meet customer demands also depend in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers. We have experienced component shortages in the past that have adversely affected our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although we generally use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources.  While our suppliers have performed effectively and have been relatively flexible to date, we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges going forward:  -      New markets that we participate in may grow quickly and thus, consume        significant component capacity                                          15 16  -      As we continue to acquire companies and new technologies, we are        dependent, at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively        small supply partners  -      We face competition for certain components, which are supply constrained,        from existing competitors and companies in other markets  Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us. We use several supply partners to manufacture our products. During the normal course of business, in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain supply partners which allow these partners to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us. For additional information regarding our purchase commitments, see Note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies" on pages 36 to 38 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein. A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in the price of one or more components, or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.  WE COMPETE IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKET  For additional information regarding our competition, see the section entitled "Competition" contained in Item 1 of this Report.  WE HAVE INVESTED IN AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES  We have made investments in headcount, inventory, manufacturing capacity, and product development through internal efforts and acquisitions, as a result of growth in existing opportunities and new or emerging opportunities in our target markets over the past years. We will continue to invest in these markets either through additional investments or through re-alignment of existing resources.  WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET  Our operating results may depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the costs to produce existing products. The success of new products is dependent on several factors, including proper new product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of new products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.                                          16 17  OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS  A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the Internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the growth of the Internet. As a result of the economic slowdown and the reduction in capital spending, spending on Internet infrastructure has declined, which has had a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  We believe that there will be certain performance problems with Internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. As we are a large supplier of networking products, we may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WHERE ADVISABLE AND ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS  The networking business is highly competitive, and as such, our growth is dependent upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. One of the ways we have addressed and will continue to address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies and technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  -      Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, and products of        the acquired companies  -      The risk of diverting management's attention from normal daily operations        of the business  -      Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process        research and development  -      Risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior        experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market        positions  -      Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply        partners  -      Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with        acquisitions  -      The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. We must also manage any growth effectively. Failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way.                                          17 18  THE ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS TO RISKS  As we focus on new market opportunities, such as transporting data, voice, and video traffic across the same network, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, Nortel, and Siemens AG, among others, and several startup companies. Several of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have experienced in the past. We have not entered into a material amount of labor-intensive service contracts, which require significant production or customization. However, we expect that demand for these types of service contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, provision of greater levels of services by us may result in less favorable timing of revenue recognition than we have historically experienced.  SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE SUBJECT TO VARIATION  Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent that service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. A decline or delay in sales orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The slowdown in the general economy, changes in the service provider market, and the constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers, with a number of such customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans. These conditions have had a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, and we expect that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future.  THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION  There has been a trend toward industry consolidation for several years. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in operating results as we compete to be a single vendor solution and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  We conduct business globally. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, foreign currency exchange rates; regulatory, political, or economic conditions in a specific country or                                          18 19  region; trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements; service provider and government spending patterns; and natural disasters. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future international business.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY  As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and nondollar-denominated operating expenses in Europe, Latin America, and Asia where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies which have extreme currency volatility. We will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary.  The increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the European Union could impact our foreign exchange exposure. We are currently hedging against fluctuations with the euro and will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro on our future foreign exchange exposure as well as on our internal systems. At the present time, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activity undertaken by us is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS  A portion of our sales is derived through our resellers in two-tier distribution channels. These resellers/customers are generally given privileges to return inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in cooperative marketing programs. We maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such exposures. However, such resellers tend to have access to more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk. We have experienced increased demands for customer financing, including loan financing and leasing solutions. We expect demands for customer financing may continue. We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products but also providing additional funds for soft costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and for working capital purposes. Due to the current slowdown in the economy, the credit risks relating to these resellers/customers have increased. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. We also continue to monitor credit exposures from weakened financial conditions in certain geographic regions, and the impact that such conditions may have on the worldwide economy. We have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations. Although these losses have not been                                          19 20  significant, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND THERE IS A RISK OF INFRINGEMENT  For additional information regarding our proprietary rights, see the section entitled "Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing" contained in Item 1 of this Report.  WE FACE RISKS FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET  There are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate on technology such as voice over the Internet, encryption technology, and access charges for Internet service providers. Our business could be materially adversely affected by the changes in the regulations surrounding the telecommunications industry. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  OUR SUCCESS LARGELY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL  Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. In spite of the economic slowdown, competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted stock options. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely product introductions. In addition, companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.  WE FACE CERTAIN LITIGATION RISKS  We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. For additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" contained in Part I of this Report.                                          20 21  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS  Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, certain of our facilities, which include one of our manufacturing facilities, are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition  THE ENERGY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND THE BUSINESSES OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUPPLY PARTNERS AND COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES  The western United States (and California in particular) has experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply, and we anticipate that this situation could continue or worsen in the near future. As a result of these episodes, certain of our operations or facilities have been and may continue to be subject to "rolling blackouts" or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power. The prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict their occurrence or duration. Certain of our suppliers and supply partners are also located in this area and their operations may also be materially and adversely affected by such interruptions. These suppliers and manufacturers may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to meet our demands, or they may increase the costs of such products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. For example, as a result of market price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments, we experienced a $5.76 billion ($3.81 billion, net of tax) decrease in net unrealized gains during fiscal 2001 on these investments. As of July 28, 2001, our publicly traded equity investments had gross unrealized losses of $784 million. Recent events have adversely affected the public equities market and general economic conditions may continue to worsen. As a result, subsequent to fiscal 2001, we may recognize in earnings declines in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis that are considered to be other-than-temporary.                                          21 22  For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see the section titled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" on pages 21 to 22 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.  WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACTIONS AND COMMENTS BY THE SEC  The SEC has been reviewing registrants' valuation methodologies of in-process research and development related to business combinations. We believe we are in compliance with all of the existing rules and related guidance as applicable to our business operations. However, the SEC may change these rules or issue new guidance applicable to our business in the future. There can be no assurance that the SEC will not seek to reduce the amount of in-process research and development previously expensed by us. This would result in the restatement of our previously filed financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for periods subsequent to the acquisitions.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC ALLIANCES  We have a number of strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and our ecosystem partners. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, these alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.  WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS  Changes in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe it is possible that there may be changes in domestic telecommunications regulation in the near future that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with various Federal Communications Commission requirements and regulations. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.                                          22 23  OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE  Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results, the published expectations of analysts, and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted stock options.                                          23 24  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES  The Company's headquarters is located on leased premises in San Jose, California. The Company has certain other operating leases for sites, both completed and under construction, which include additional manufacturing facilities, in the surrounding areas of San Jose, California; Boxborough, Massachusetts; Salem, New Hampshire; Richardson, Texas; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The Company also leases office space in other U.S. locations, as well as locations in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); Asia Pacific; and Japan. For additional information regarding the Company's obligations under leases, see Note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies" on pages 36 to 38 of the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.  ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  Beginning on April 20, 2001, a number of purported shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. The lawsuits are essentially identical, and purport to bring suit on behalf of those who purchased the Company's publicly traded securities between August 10, 1999 and April 16, 2001. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements, purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws, and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously.  In addition, beginning on April 23, 2001, a number of purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, against the Company (as a nominal defendant), its directors and certain officers.
