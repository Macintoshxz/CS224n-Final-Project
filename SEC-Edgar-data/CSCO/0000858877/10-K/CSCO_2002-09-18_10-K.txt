BUSINESS  GENERAL  Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Report"), including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projections," and words of similar import, constitute "forward-looking statements." You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including risks faced by us described in this Report, including the "Risk Factors" section contained in this Item 1, and the other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including our most recent reports on Form 8-K and Form 10-Q, and amendments thereto.  Cisco Systems, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Cisco" or the "Company") is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. Cisco hardware, software, and service offerings are used to create Internet solutions so that individuals, companies, and countries have seamless access to information -- regardless of differences in time and place. Cisco solutions provide competitive advantage to our customers through more efficient and timely exchange of information, which in turn leads to cost savings, process efficiencies, and closer relationships with their customers, prospects, business partners, suppliers, and employees. These solutions form the networking foundation for companies, universities, utilities, and government agencies worldwide.  The Company markets its products through its direct sales force, single and two-tier distributors, value-added resellers, service providers, and system integrators. This multiple-channel approach allows customers to select the channel that addresses their specific needs and provides the Company with broad coverage of worldwide markets.  Cisco was incorporated in California in December 1984 and is headquartered in San Jose. The mailing address for the Company's headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California, 95134-1706, and its telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Cisco can also be reached at its Web site www.cisco.com.                                           3 4  END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS  Cisco is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. The Cisco strategy is to provide end-to-end networking solutions to help its customers improve productivity and gain a competitive advantage in today's global economy. Cisco helps its customers build their own network infrastructure while also providing tools to allow them to communicate to their customers, prospects, business partners, suppliers, and employees. An end-to-end networking solution allows network services to be consistently provided to all users on the network.  Cisco's product portfolio offers a broad range of end-to-end networking hardware, software, and services. Products are used individually or in combinations to connect computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other -- whether they are within a building, across a campus, or around the world. The Company's breadth of product offerings enables it to offer a wide range of solutions to meet customer requirements. Many of the Company's products are easily upgraded or expanded, offering customers the ability to extend their networks as their needs grow.  The Company also provides products and services that allow customers to transition their data networks to a single multiservice data, voice, and video network.  Cisco product offerings fall into several categories:  Routing  Routing is a foundation technology for computer networking. Routers move information from one network to another, applying intelligence in the process to ensure that the information reaches its destination securely and in the most direct way possible. Cisco offers a broad range of routers that can be used from a large backbone infrastructure to a small office, including the Cisco 12000 gigabit switch router ("GSR") series; the Cisco 7500 series; the Cisco 4000 series; and the Cisco 8500, 3600, 2600, 2500, 1000, 800, and 700 product families.  Switching  Switching is another important networking technology that is used in both local-area networks ("LANs") and wide-area networks ("WANs"). Cisco's switching strategy is designed to help users migrate from traditional shared LANs to fully switched networks by delivering products that support the varying levels of flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and high bandwidth required for today's desktop, workgroup, and backbone applications. Cisco solutions employ all widely used switching technologies --                                          4 5  Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode ("ATM"). Cisco's LAN switching products include the Catalyst(R) product family, and its WAN switching products include the Cisco IGX(TM), Cisco BPX(R), Cisco TGX, and Cisco MGX(TM) families.  Access  Today, people need remote access to the Internet or to a network that is used for a variety of personal, professional, or work-related applications. Cisco access solutions give groups and individuals who are remotely located similar levels of connectivity and information access, as they would have if they were located at the company's head office or at home. Asynchronous and integrated services digital network ("ISDN") remote-access routers, dial-up access servers, digital subscriber line ("DSL") technologies, and cable universal broadband routers provide telecommuters and mobile workers and students with remote network access. The Company's access products include the Cisco AS5000 family of access servers; the Cisco 6100 and 6200 lines of digital subscriber line access multiplexers ("DSLAM"); the Cisco uBR7200 Universal Broadband Router cable head-end equipment; access routers such as the Cisco 6000, 4000, 3800, 3600, 2600, 1700, and 1600 families; and the Cisco ISR 3303 Integrated SONET/SDH Router, and network security and management software.  Other  The other product offerings consists of systems network architecture, Internet services, network management software, and customer advocacy, among others, as follows:  Systems Network Architecture  Most large organizations have existing IBM computing systems that use the Systems Network Architecture ("SNA") networking method as well as LANs based on open network architectures [such as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP")]. Increasingly, network managers want to combine these two networks into a single network that leverages existing investments. Cisco provides a broad range of products and solutions for the IBM marketplace that maximizes availability, scalability, performance, flexibility, and management. These products provide IBM networks with a clear migration path to the future while protecting investments in existing equipment and applications.  Internet Service  Cisco offers end-to-end Internet services to improve a network manager's ability to cope with challenges posed by the growing popularity of the Internet, such as network traffic volume and network address shortages. Cisco Internet Service Units ("ISUs")                                          5 6  drive architectural consistency across the Company by focusing on standards-based services between clients and servers such as end-to-end quality of service ("QoS") and end-to-end security. Cisco ISU products include: the PIX(TM) Firewall family, which prevents unauthorized access to a network; the NetSonar(TM) System, which scans the network for security risks; the NetRanger(R) System, which detects and responds to unauthorized activity or network attacks; Cisco Secure VPN Client 1.0, which ensures data privacy when accessing the network remotely; Cisco LocalDirector, Cisco Cache Engine, and Cisco DistributedDirector, which balance the load between multiple servers to enable timely access and to eliminate redundant Internet content; and the Cisco Server Suite 1000, which consists of server applications with a graphical user interface ("GUI").  Network Management Software  Cisco is extending its leading Internet business practices to its network management vision and products. One component of this initiative is CiscoWorks2000, a family of products based on Internet standards that enables enterprise customers to better control their large, complex, and heterogeneous networks and devices.  In order for service providers to profit from increasing new business opportunities, services must be carefully planned, quickly provisioned, efficiently operated, and accurately billed. The Cisco Service Management system ("CSM") is a network service and delivery management system that provides a modular suite of service management products integrated within a common and scalable infrastructure. CSM enables service providers to effectively deploy, monitor, and manage these new network services, while potentially increasing revenue and reducing cost.  Cisco created a new business group focused on building software solutions to expand the Company's technology offerings into messaging and call centers and extend Cisco's presence in the broader market for intelligent customer contact software applications. Software applications from this team will provide end-users with the ability to unify voice-mail, e-mail, and fax traffic into a single mailbox accessible over an Internet-based network independent of location, time, or device. And, when calling in for customer support, they will be connected to the best available customer service representative regardless of physical location.  Customer Advocacy  The Company enables successful deployment of global networks by providing flexible support service solutions that meet today's needs, provide a smooth transition to the new world,                                          6 7  ensure faster deployment of services, reduce and manage the risk associated with rapidly integrating new technologies, streamline business processes, and reduce operating costs. Customer Advocacy provides a broad range of services, such as consultative, technical, project, quality, customer service, and maintenance level services, which further complement Cisco product offerings.  The following product is offered in conjunction with all of the above product categories:  Cisco IOS(R) Software  Cisco IOS Software is a common networking software platform deployed across a broad spectrum of Cisco products. Cisco IOS Software delivers intelligent network services -- such as QoS, load-balancing, and multicast functions -- that enable customers to build a flexible network infrastructure that is scalable, reliable, and secure. These intelligent network services also support Internet business solutions.  Among the emerging types of applications that require these features are on-demand media, electronic commerce services, real-time trading, and distance-learning activities. These applications form the foundation for new business models that increase competition, improve customer service, and enhance productivity.  CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS  Networking needs are influenced by a number of factors, including the size of the organization, number and types of computer systems, geographic location, and the applications requiring data communications. The Cisco customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry and in each of the past five fiscal years, no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company's net sales. For additional information regarding segment information for the Company, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.  The Cisco market strategy addresses four main customer profiles:  Enterprise  Enterprise customers generally are large organizations with 500 or more employees with complex networking needs, usually spanning multiple locations and types of computer systems. Enterprise customers include corporations, government agencies, utilities, and educational institutions.                                           7 8  Service Providers  These customers provide data, voice, and video communication services to businesses and consumers. They include regional, national, and international long distance telecommunications carriers, as well as Internet, cable, and wireless service providers.  Small/Medium-Sized Businesses  These customers have less than 500 employees and a need for networks of their own, as well as connection to the Internet and to business partners. However, these customers generally have limited expertise in networking technology; therefore, the Company attempts to provide products that are affordable and easy to install and use.  Consumers  Consumers have a need for networking devices and services to connect them to the Internet from within their homes. In addition, some advanced consumers will network together a range of devices within their home, linking together devices such as personal computer, television, telephone, fax, and more, into an integrated personal network. Internet access services are provided to them through regional carriers and Internet service providers.  CISCO SALES OVERVIEW  The Company's worldwide direct sales and marketing organization at July 29, 2000 consisted of approximately 14,000 individuals, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. The Company has field sales offices globally providing coverage throughout the world. Additionally, the Company's international sales are currently being made through multiple channels including international distributors, resellers, and direct sales throughout the world. The distributors provide system installation, technical support, and follow-up services to end-customers. Generally, the Company's international distributors have nonexclusive, country-wide agreements. For additional information regarding the Company's international sales, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.  Cisco Capital specializes in financing networking equipment. Cisco Capital offers innovative, flexible financial services to Cisco's customers and channel partners at competitive rates. Our services are designed to help our customers spread their costs of acquisition, management, and end-of-life disposal associated with networking products. For additional information regarding Cisco Capital's financing activities, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.                                           8 9  ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND ALLIANCES  The end-to-end networking strategy pursued by Cisco requires a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The combination of complexity and rapid change make it difficult for one company, no matter how large, to develop all technological solutions alone. Acquisitions, investments, and alliances are tools used by the Company to fill gaps in its offerings and enable it to deliver complete solutions to customers and prospects in its target markets.  Satisfying customers' networking needs requires a constant monitoring of market and technology trends, plus an ability to act quickly. Cisco has a four-part approach to satisfying the need for new or enhanced networking products and solutions. In order of preference, the approach is to develop new technologies and products internally; enter into joint-development efforts with other companies; resell another company's product; and acquire all or part of another company.  Since 1993, the Company has acquired a number of companies. The Company expects to make future acquisitions where it believes that it can acquire new products and channels of distribution or otherwise rapidly enter new or emerging markets. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that the Company's previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition or operating results. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the "Risk Factors" section contained in Item 1 of this Report.  The Company's acquisitions have furthered its commitment towards providing an end-to-end networking solution. The Company now has a broad set of product offerings and technologies, which include Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet switching, Token Ring, ATM switching, SONET/SDH, xDSL, dial-up access, converged data, voice, and video technologies, Tag Switching [currently also known as multiprotocol label switching ("MPLS")], optical transport, wireless, content networking, call center and unified messaging solutions, network security, and network management software solutions, among others.  MINORITY INVESTMENTS  The Company makes minority investments in companies that build technology or provide services that are complementary to Cisco products or that support the Internet. By investing in new ventures, Cisco strengthens its partnerships with such companies. Together,                                          9 10  Cisco and its partners can offer more complete solutions to the market.  STRATEGIC ALLIANCES  Cisco pursues strategic alliances with other industry leaders in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets. The objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, and new-market creation. This year, Cisco expanded or entered into alliances with Cap Gemini/Ernst & Young, Hewlett Packard, Intel, IBM, KPMG Consulting, Inc., Microsoft, Motorola, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Telcordia, among others.  BACKLOG  The Company's backlog at September 25, 2000 was approximately $3.83 billion compared with a backlog of approximately $922 million at September 20, 1999. The Company includes in its backlog only orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped within 120 days to customers with approved credit status. Because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment, and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders (which are made without significant penalty), the Company does not believe that its backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period.  COMPETITION  Cisco competes in the Internet infrastructure market, providing solutions for transporting data, voice, and video traffic across intranets, extranets, and the Internet. The market is characterized by rapid growth, converging technologies, and a conversion to New World solutions that offer superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to Cisco. The Company competes with numerous vendors in each product category. Cisco expects that the overall number of competitors providing niche product solutions will increase due to the market's attractive growth. On the other hand, the Company expects the number of vendors supplying end-to-end networking solutions will decrease, due to the rapid pace of acquisitions in the industry. The Company believes its primary competition comes from nimble start-ups and young companies offering innovative niche solutions.  Cisco's competitors include Alcatel, Ericsson, Extreme, Foundry, Juniper, Lucent, Nortel, Redback, Siemens AG, and Sycamore. Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others do not offer as wide a breadth of solutions.                                          10 11  Several of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we do.  The principal competitive factors in the markets in which the Company presently competes and may compete in the future are:  -   Price and/or ability to provide financing;  -   Performance;  -   The ability to provide end-to-end networking solutions and support;  -   Conformance to standards;  -   The ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability,     and investment protection; and  -   Market presence  The Company also faces competition from customers it licenses technology to and suppliers from whom it transfers technology. Networking's inherent nature requires inter-operability. As such, the Company must cooperate and at the same time compete with these companies. The Company's inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  The Company has enhanced and extended its product lines with new product and feature introductions including optical transport, data, voice, and video integration, virtual private networking, DSL, cable modem, gigabit switching, wireless, content networking (content distribution and management, content routing, content edge delivery, content switching, and intelligent network services), security, and network management, among others.  However, the industry in which Cisco competes in is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, the Company's success, in part, depends upon its ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance its existing solutions and to develop and introduce new solutions that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. In order to achieve these objectives, the Company's management and engineering personnel work closely with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of inter-networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. The Company will also continue to make strategic acquisitions and equity investments where appropriate. The Company intends to remain dedicated to industry standards and to continue to support important protocol standards as they                                          11 12  emerge. Still, there can be no assurance that Cisco will be able to successfully develop new products to address new customer requirements and technological changes, or that such products will achieve market acceptance.  In fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company's research and development expenditures were approximately $2.70 billion, $1.66 billion, and $1.05 billion, respectively. All of the Company's expenditures for research and development costs, as well as in-process research and development of approximately $1.37 billion, $471 million, and $594 million in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, have been expensed as incurred.  MANUFACTURING  The Company's manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials, components, and subassemblies. Additionally, the Company performs final assembly and test. The Company presently uses a variety of independent third-party companies to perform printed circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, and product repair. The Company and its single enterprise partners install proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips installed in its systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables the Company to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The Company and its single enterprise partners also use automated testing equipment and "burn-in" procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process control, to assure the quality and reliability of its products. The Company's and its partners' manufacturing processes and procedures are ISO 9001 certified.  PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING  Cisco's success is dependent upon its proprietary technology. Cisco generally relies upon patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in its technology and products. Cisco has a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where a potential market for Cisco's products exists. Cisco has been issued a number of patents; other patent applications are currently pending. There can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to Cisco. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications, or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect Cisco's technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may                                          12 13  not permit the protection of Cisco's proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although Cisco believes the protection afforded by its patents, patent applications, copyrights, and trademarks has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry makes Cisco's future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of its employees rather than on patent, copyright, and trademark protection.  Many of Cisco's products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, Cisco believes that based upon past experience and standard industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe patent rights of others. From time to time, Cisco receives notices from or is sued by third-parties regarding patent claims. If infringement is alleged, Cisco believes that, based upon industry practice, any necessary license or rights under such patents may be obtained on terms that would not have a material adverse effect on Cisco's business, operating results, or financial condition. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that Cisco would prevail in any such challenge. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation could have a material adverse effect on Cisco's business, operating results, and financial condition.  EMPLOYEES  As of July 29, 2000, the Company employed approximately 34,000 persons, including 6,000 in manufacturing, service and support, 14,000 in sales and marketing, 11,000 in engineering, and 3,000 in finance and administration. Approximately 9,000 employees were in international locations.  The Company considers the relationships with its employees to be positive. The Company has not experienced any work stoppages.  Competition for technical personnel in the industry that Cisco competes in is intense. The Company believes that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, Cisco believes that they have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in the future.                                         13 14  RISK FACTORS  Set forth below and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report.  YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS  The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Our operating results have in the past been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of a number of factors. These factors include:  -   The integration of people, operations, and products from acquired businesses     and technologies;  -   Increased competition in the networking industry;  -   The overall trend toward industry consolidation;  -   The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and standards,     including switch routers, Gigabit Ethernet switching, Tag Switching     (currently also known as multiprotocol label switching ["MPLS"]), optical     transport, wireless, content networking and data, voice, and video     capabilities;  -   Variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold;  -   The timing of orders and manufacturing lead times;  -   The trend towards sales of integrated network solutions;  -   The timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employees' gains     on stock options exercised; and  -   Changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in     the computer and networking industries.  Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results. For example, from time to time, we have made acquisitions that result in in-process research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter. These charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. Additionally, as a further example, the dollar amounts of large orders for our products have been increasing and therefore the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely affected if a number of large orders are either not received or are delayed, for example, due to cancellations, delays, or deferrals by customers.                                           14 15  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES  We are investing in increased headcount, inventory, manufacturing capacity, and product development through internal efforts and acquisitions, as a result of growth in existing opportunities and new or emerging opportunities in our target markets. We intend to add resources across all functions.  With increased levels of spending, an inability to meet expected revenue levels in a particular quarter could have a material, negative impact on our operating results for that period as we will not be able to react quickly enough to scale back expenses. Increased investments across all functions could translate into a faster rate of expense growth compared to revenue growth.  SINCE OUR GROWTH RATE MAY SLOW, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT  We expect that in the future, our net sales may grow at a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, our growth in net sales may be significantly lower than our historical quarterly growth rate. As a consequence, operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict. Our ability to meet financial expectations could be hampered if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in past quarters reoccurs in future periods. We generally have had one quarter of the fiscal year when backlog has been reduced. Although such reductions have not occurred consistently in recent years, they are difficult to predict and may occur in the future. In addition, in response to customer demand, we continue to attempt to reduce our product manufacturing lead times, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results going forward. On the other hand, for certain products, lead times are longer than our goal. If we cannot reduce manufacturing lead times for such products, our customers may cancel orders or not place further orders if shorter lead times are available from other manufacturers.                                           15 16  WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO DECLINE OVER TIME  We expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs, heightened price competition, increasing levels of services, higher inventory balances, introduction of new products for new high-growth markets, and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold. We believe gross margin may additionally be impacted due to constraints relating to certain component shortages that currently exist in the supply chain. We may also experience a lower gross margin as the product mix for access and optical product volume grows.  We have recently introduced several new products, with additional new products scheduled to be released in the future. Increase in demand would result in increased manufacturing capacity, which in turn would result in higher inventory balances. In addition, our vendor base is capacity-constrained, and this could result in increased cost pressure on certain components. If product or related warranty costs associated with these new products are greater than we have experienced, gross margin may be adversely affected. Our gross margin may also be impacted by geographic mix, as well as the mix of configurations within each product group. We continue to expand into third-party or indirect-distribution channels, which generally results in a lower gross margin. In addition, increasing third-party and indirect-distribution channels generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product, and to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. Downward pressures on our gross margin may be further impacted by other factors, such as increased percentage of revenue from service provider markets, which may have lower margins or an increase in product costs, which could adversely affect our future operating results.  We also expect that our operating margin may decrease as we continue to hire additional personnel and experience increases in overall operating expenses to support our business. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. Because these expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations.  WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY  Our growth and ability to meet customer demands also depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers. We have experienced component shortages in the past that have adversely affected our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although we generally use standard parts                                          16 17  and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources.  While our suppliers have performed effectively and been relatively flexible to date, we believe that we will be faced with the following challenges going forward:  -   New markets that we participate in may grow quickly and thus, consume     significant component capacity;  -   As we continue to acquire companies and new technologies, we are dependent,     at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply     partners;  -   We face increased competition for certain components, which are currently     supply constrained, from existing competitors and companies in other     markets.  Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us. For example, we have increased our manufacturing capacity significantly and plan to further increase capacity during the coming months. To mitigate the component supply constraints, we have started to build inventory levels. A reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of one or more components would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, perhaps materially, and could materially damage customer relationships.  WE COMPETE IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKET  For additional information regarding our competition, see the section entitled "Competition" contained in Item 1 of this Report.  WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WHERE ADVISABLE AND ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS  The networking business is highly competitive, and as such, our growth is dependent upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. One of the ways we have addressed and will continue to address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  - Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, and products of the acquired companies;                                           17 18  -   The risk of diverting management's attention from normal daily operations of     the business;  -   Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process     research and development;  -   Risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior     experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market     positions;  -   Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply     partners;  -   Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with     acquisitions; and  -   The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.  Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.  We must also manage any growth effectively. Failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we made could harm our business and operating results in a material way.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY  As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and nondollar-denominated operating expenses in Europe, Latin America, and Asia where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have continued to see our exposures to emerging market currencies, such as the Korean won, increase because of our expanding presence in these markets and their extreme currency volatility. We will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary.  The increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the European Union could impact our foreign exchange exposure. We are currently hedging against fluctuations with the euro and will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro on our future foreign exchange exposure as well as on our internal systems. At the present time, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activity undertaken by                                          18 19  us is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS  A significant proportion of our sales are derived through our partners in two-tier distribution channels. These customers are generally given privileges to return inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in cooperative marketing programs. We maintain appropriate accruals and allowances for such exposures. However, such partners tend to have access to more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk. We are experiencing increased demands for customer financing, including loan financing, and leasing solutions. We expect demands for customer financing to continue. We believe it is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products but also providing additional funds for soft costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and for working capital purposes. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risk. We also continue to monitor increased credit exposures from weakened financial conditions in certain geographical regions, and the impact that such conditions may have on the worldwide economy. We have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations. Although these losses have not been significant, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES  For additional information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" contained in Part II of this Report.  WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACTIONS AND COMMENTS BY THE SEC AND FASB  Recent actions and comments from the SEC have indicated they are reviewing the current valuation methodology of in-process research and development related to business combinations. The SEC is concerned that some companies are writing off more of the                                          19 20  value of an acquisition than is appropriate. We believe we are in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist. However, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not seek to reduce the amount of in-process research and development previously expensed by us. This would result in the restatement of our previously filed financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for periods subsequent to the acquisitions. Additionally, FASB has announced that it plans to rescind the pooling of interests method of acquisition accounting. If this occurs, it could alter our acquisition strategy and impair our ability to acquire companies.  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND THERE IS A RISK OF INFRINGEMENT  For additional information regarding our proprietary rights, see the section entitled "Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing" contained in Item 1 of this Report.  WE FACE RISKS FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET  There are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate, on such technology as voice over the Internet, encryption technology, and access charges for Internet service providers. We also could be materially adversely affected by the continuing deregulation of the telecommunications industry. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase our cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  THE ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS TO RISKS  As we focus on new market opportunities, such as transporting data, voice, and video traffic across the same network, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, Nortel, and Siemens AG, among others, and several well-funded start-up companies. Several of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have experienced in the past. We have not entered into a material amount of labor intensive service contracts which require significant production                                          20 21  or customization. However, we expect that demand for these types of service contracts will increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, provision of greater levels of services by us may result in less favorable timing of revenue recognition than we have historically experienced.  THE LOCATION OF OUR FACILITIES SUBJECTS US TO THE RISK OF EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS  Our corporate headquarters, including most of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, certain of our facilities, which includes one of our manufacturing facilities, are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET  Our operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to reduce the costs to produce existing products. In particular, we broadened our product line by introducing network access products. Sales of these products, which are generally lower priced and carry lower margins than our core products, have increased more rapidly than sales of our core products. The success of these and other new products is dependent on several factors, including proper new product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of new products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, and achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC ALLIANCES  We have increased the number of our strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and our ecosystem partners. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. If successful, these                                           21 22  relationships will be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, these alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have strategic alliances and, at the same time, cooperate with such company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.  THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION  There has been a trend toward industry consolidation for several years. We expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry. We believe that industry consolidation may provide stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in operating results as we compete to be a single vendor solution and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  SALES IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE SUBJECT TO VARIATION  Although sales to the service provider market have grown historically, this market is characterized by large and often sporadic purchases. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent that service providers are affected by regulatory and business conditions in the country of operations. A decline or delay in sales orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS  Changes in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe it is possible that there may be significant changes in domestic telecommunications regulation in the near future that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with various Federal Communications Commission requirements and regulations. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by                                          22 23  us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  We conduct business globally. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, foreign currency exchange rates; regulatory, political, or economic conditions in a specific country or region; trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements; service provider and government spending patterns; and natural disasters. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future international business.  OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS  We believe that there will be performance problems with Internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. As we are a large supplier of equipment for the Internet infrastructure, customers' perceptions of our products and the marketplace's perception of us as a supplier of networking products may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE  Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results, the published expectations of analysts, and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, all of whom have been granted stock options.                                           23 24                                        OTHER  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), our independent accountants, has notified us that PwC is engaged in discussions with the SEC following an internal review by PwC, pursuant to an administrative settlement with the SEC, of PwC's compliance with auditor independence guidelines. PwC has advised us that we are one of the companies affected by such discussions. We are not involved in the discussions between the SEC and PwC and cannot predict the result of those discussions.                                            24 25  ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES  The Company's principal corporate offices are located at sites in Alviso, Milpitas, and San Jose, California. The Company's main headquarters are situated in San Jose, California. There are currently 50 buildings located at these sites, three of which are manufacturing facilities, and the Company expects that construction at its current sites will continue through fiscal 2001. The Company has certain other operating leases for buildings, which include additional manufacturing facilities, located at various sites near San Jose, California.  Additionally, the Company leases land for research and development and customer-support activities in Boxborough, Massachusetts; Salem, New Hampshire; Richardson, Texas; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The Company also leases various small offices throughout the United States and on a worldwide basis. For additional information regarding the Company's obligations under leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  None.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  All historical financial information has been restated to reflect the acquisitions that were accounted for as poolings of interests (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  Certain statements contained in this Annual Report, including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projections," and words of similar import, constitute "forward-looking statements." You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including risks faced by us described in this Report, including those set forth under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1, and the other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including our most recent reports on Form 10-K, Form 8-K, and Form 10-Q, and amendments thereto.  COMPARISON OF FISCAL 2000 AND FISCAL 1999  Net sales in fiscal 2000 were $18.93 billion, compared with $12.17 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of 55.5%. The increase in net sales was primarily a result of increased unit sales of switch, router, and access products; growth in the sales of add-on boards that provide increased functionality; optical transport products; and maintenance, service, and support sales (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  We manage our business on four geographic theaters: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); Asia Pacific; and Japan. Summarized financial information by theater for fiscal 2000 and 1999 is presented in the following table (in millions): Percentage of                                     Amount                             Net Sales                            --------------------------          -------------------------                            July 29,          July 31,          July 29,         July 31, Years Ended                  2000              1999              2000             1999 -----------                --------          --------          --------         -------- Net sales:  Americas                  $ 12,924          $  8,088              68.3%            66.4%  EMEA                         4,770             3,216              25.2             26.4  Asia Pacific                 1,705               825               9.0              6.8  Japan                          935               566               4.9              4.7  Sales adjustments           (1,406)             (522)             (7.4)            (4.3)                            --------          --------          --------         --------     Total                  $ 18,928          $ 12,173             100.0%           100.0%                            ========          ========          ========         ======== The revenue growth for each theater was primarily driven by market demand and the deployment of Internet technologies and business solutions.                                         29 30  Gross margin in fiscal 2000 was 64.4%, compared with 65.0% in fiscal 1999. The following table shows the standard margins for each theater: July 29,   July 31, Years Ended                                                               2000       1999 -----------                                                               ----       ---- Standard margins:  Americas                                                                72.8%       72.2%  EMEA                                                                    75.1%       74.0%  Asia Pacific                                                            71.3%       71.0%  Japan                                                                   78.8%       77.0% The net sales and standard margins by geographic theater differ from the amounts recognized under generally accepted accounting principles because we do not allocate certain sales adjustments, production overhead, and manufacturing variances and other related costs to the theaters. Sales adjustments relate to revenue deferrals and reserves, credit memos, returns, and other timing differences.  Standard margins increased for all geographic theaters as compared with fiscal 1999. The decrease in the overall gross margin was primarily due to shifts in product mix, introduction of new products, which generally have lower margins when first released, higher production-related costs, the continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas, and the above-mentioned sales adjustments, which were not included in the standard margins.  We expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs, heightened price competition, increasing levels of services, higher inventory balances, introduction of new products for new high-growth markets, and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold. We believe gross margin may additionally be impacted due to constraints relating to certain component shortages that currently exist in the supply chain. We may also experience a lower gross margin as the product mix for access and optical product volume grows.  We have recently introduced several new products, with additional new products scheduled to be released in the future. Increase in demand would result in increased manufacturing capacity, which in turn would result in higher inventory balances. In addition, our vendor base is capacity-constrained, and this could result in increased cost pressure on certain components. If product or related warranty costs associated with these new products are greater than we have experienced, gross margin may be adversely affected. Our gross margin may also be impacted by geographic mix, as well as the mix of configurations within each product group. We continue to expand into third-party or indirect-distribution channels, which generally results in a lower gross margin. In addition, increasing third-party and indirect-                                         30 31  distribution channels generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product, and to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. Downward pressures on our gross margin may be further impacted by other factors, such as increased percentage of revenue from service provider markets, which may have lower margins or an increase in product costs, which could adversely affect our future operating results.  Research and development ("R&D") expenses in fiscal 2000 were $2.70 billion, compared with $1.66 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of 62.6%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 14.3% in fiscal 2000, compared with 13.7% in fiscal 1999. The increase reflected our ongoing R&D efforts in a wide variety of areas such as data, voice, and video integration, digital subscriber line ("DSL") technologies, cable modem technology, wireless access, dial access, enterprise switching, optical transport, security, network management, and high-end routing technologies, among others. A significant portion of the increase was due to the addition of new personnel, partly through acquisitions, as well as higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on additional lab equipment. We also continued to purchase technology in order to bring a broad range of products to the market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may license technology from other businesses or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. All of our R&D costs are expensed as incurred. We currently expect that R&D expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in technology to address potential market opportunities.  Sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2000 were $3.95 billion, compared with $2.46 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of 60.1%. Sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 20.8% in fiscal 2000, compared with 20.2% in fiscal 1999. The increase was principally due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions, additional marketing and advertising investments associated with the introduction of new products, the expansion of distribution channels, and general corporate branding. The increase also reflected our efforts to invest in certain key areas, such as expansion of our end-to-end networking strategy and service provider coverage, in order to be positioned to take advantage of future market opportunities. We currently expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars.  General and administrative ("G&A") expenses in fiscal 2000 were $633 million, compared with $381 million in fiscal 1999, an increase of 66.1%. G&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 3.3% in fiscal 2000, compared with 3.1% in fiscal 1999. G&A expenses for fiscal 2000 and 1999 included acquisition-                                         31 32  related costs of approximately $62 million and $16 million, respectively. Excluding the acquisition-related costs, the increase in G&A expenses was primarily related to the addition of new personnel and investments in infrastructure. We intend to keep G&A expenses relatively constant as a percentage of net sales; however, this depends on the level of acquisition activity and our growth, among other factors.  Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was $291 million in fiscal 2000, compared with $61 million in fiscal 1999. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets primarily relates to various purchase acquisitions (see Note 3 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets will continue to increase as we acquire companies and technologies.  The amount expensed to in-process research and development ("in-process R&D") arose from the purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The fair values of the existing products and patents, as well as the technology currently under development, were determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations were typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys, adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle. These risk factors have increased the overall discount rate for acquisitions in the current year. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications equipment industry. However, we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in-process technology. Therefore, the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings.  The development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats from numerous companies. The nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning, designing, and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. Failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.                                         32 33  The following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations for our significant purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000 and 1999 (in millions, except percentages): Acquisition Assumptions                                                                -----------------------                                                           Estimated Cost                                                             to Complete       Risk-Adjusted                                                            Technology at         Discount                                                               Time of          Rate for In-                     Acquired Company                        Acquisition        Process R&D                     ----------------                        -----------        ----------- Fiscal 2000 ----------- Monterey Networks, Inc.                                        $   4                 30.0%  The optical systems business of Pirelli S.p.A.                 $   5                 20.0%  Aironet Wireless Communications, Inc.                          $   3                 23.5%  Atlantech Technologies                                         $   6                 37.5%  JetCell, Inc.                                                  $   7                 30.5%  PentaCom, Ltd.                                                 $  13                 30.0%  Qeyton Systems                                                 $   6                 35.0%  Fiscal 1999 ----------- Summa Four, Inc.                                               $   5                 25.0%  Clarity Wireless, Inc.                                         $  42                 32.0%  Selsius Systems, Inc.                                          $  15                 31.0%  PipeLinks, Inc.                                                $   5                 31.0%  Amteva Technologies                                            $   4                 35.0% Regarding our purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000 and 1999, actual results to date have been consistent, in all material respects, with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions. The assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in-process projects, estimated costs to complete the projects, and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market. Shipment volumes of products from the above-acquired technologies are not material to our overall financial results at the present time. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology or product life cycle. Failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities.  Interest and other income, net, was $577 million in fiscal 2000, compared with $330 million in fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily due to interest income related to the general increase in cash and investments, which was generated from our operations. Net gains realized on minority investments were $531 million in                                         33 34  fiscal 2000. The net gains realized on minority investments were not material in fiscal 1999.  Our pro forma effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 was 30.0%. The actual effective tax rate was 38.6%, which included the impact of nondeductible in-process R&D and acquisition-related costs. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower effective rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations. Additionally, we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock option exercises (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1999 AND FISCAL 1998  Net sales in fiscal 1999 were $12.17 billion, compared with $8.49 billion in fiscal 1998, an increase of 43.4%. The increase in net sales was primarily a result of increased unit sales of LAN switching products, access servers, high-performance WAN switching and routing products, and maintenance service contracts.  Gross margin in fiscal 1999 was 65.0%, compared with 65.6% in fiscal 1998. The decrease in the overall gross margin was primarily due to our continued shift in revenue mix toward our lower-margin products and the continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas.  R&D expenses in fiscal 1999 were $1.66 billion, compared with $1.05 billion in fiscal 1998, an increase of 58.1%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 13.7% in fiscal 1999, compared with 12.4% in fiscal 1998. The increase reflected our ongoing R&D efforts in a wide variety of areas such as data, voice, and video integration, DSL technologies, cable modem technology, wireless access, dial access, enterprise switching, security, network management, and high-end routing technologies, among others. A significant portion of the increase was due to the addition of new personnel, partly through acquisitions, as well as higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on additional lab equipment.  Sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1999 were $2.46 billion, compared with $1.58 billion in fiscal 1998, an increase of 56.1%. Sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 20.2% in fiscal 1999, compared with 18.6% in fiscal 1998. The increase was principally due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions, television advertising campaigns to build brand awareness, additional marketing and advertising costs associated with the introduction                                         34 35  of new products, and the expansion of distribution channels. The increase also reflected our efforts to invest in certain key areas, such as expansion of our end-to-end networking strategy and service provider coverage, in order to be positioned to take advantage of future market opportunities.  G&A expenses in fiscal 1999 were $381 million, compared with $247 million in fiscal 1998, an increase of 54.3%. G&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 3.1% in fiscal 1999, compared with 2.9% in fiscal 1998. The increase was primarily related to additional personnel and acquisition-related costs of $16 million.  Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was $61 million in fiscal 1999, compared with $23 million in fiscal 1998. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets increased as we acquired companies and technologies.  Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 1999 was $330 million, compared with $196 million in fiscal 1998. Interest income rose primarily as a result of additional investment income on our increased investment balances.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. We do not expect the initial adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material effect on our operations or financial position. We are required to adopt SFAS 133 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001.  In September 1999, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D-83, "Accounting for Payroll Taxes Associated with Stock Option Exercises" ("EITF D-83"). EITF D-83 requires that payroll tax paid on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with an employee's exercise of stock options be recorded as operating expenses. Payroll tax on stock option exercises of $51 million was expensed in fiscal 2000.  In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101, as amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue                                          35 36  recognition in financial statements. At this time, we do not expect the adoption of SAB 101 to have a material effect on our operations or financial position; however, the SEC's final guidance for implementation has not been released to date. We are required to adopt SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and investments were $20.50 billion at July 29, 2000, an increase of $10.28 billion from July 31, 1999. The increase was primarily a result of $5.00 billion of net unrealized gains on publicly held investments and $7.70 billion of cash generated by operating and financing activities partially offset by investing activities, including net capital expenditures of $1.09 billion, purchases of technology licenses of $444 million, and investments in lease receivables of $535 million.  Accounts receivable increased 83.9% during fiscal 2000. Days sales outstanding in receivables increased to 37 days for fiscal 2000, from 32 days for fiscal 1999. The increase in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding was due, in part, to growth in total net sales combined with conditions in a number of markets, resulting in longer payment terms.  Inventories increased 87.2% during fiscal 2000; however, inventory turns remained constant at 7.8 times. The increase in inventory levels reflected new product introductions, continued growth in our two-tier distribution system, and increased purchases to secure the supply of certain components. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.  At July 29, 2000, we had a line of credit totaling $500 million, which expires in July 2002. There have been no borrowings under this agreement (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  We have entered into several agreements to lease 448 acres of land located in San Jose, California, where our headquarters operations are established, and 759 acres of land located in Boxborough, Massachusetts; Salem, New Hampshire; Richardson, Texas; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where we have expanded certain R&D and customer-support activities. In connection with these transactions, we have pledged $1.29 billion of our investments as collateral for certain obligations of the leases. We anticipate that we will occupy more leased property in the future that will require similar pledged securities; however, we do not expect the impact of this activity to be material to                                          36 37  our liquidity position (see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements).  We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, line of credit, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital, capital expenditure, and investment requirements through at least the next 12 months.                                           37 38   ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. For example, as a result of recent market price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments, we experienced a $111 million after-tax unrealized loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2000 and a $1.83 billion after-tax unrealized gain during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 on these investments. We have also invested in numerous privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire initial investment in these companies. We also have certain real estate lease commitments with payments tied to short-term interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio while increasing the costs associated with our lease commitments. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures.                                         38 39   INVESTMENTS  The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held at July 29, 2000 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points ("BPS"), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS over a 12-month horizon. Beginning fair values represent the principal plus accrued interest and dividends of the interest rate-sensitive financial instruments at July 29, 2000. Ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest, dividends, and reinvestment income at a 12-month horizon. The following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a 12-month horizon (in millions): Valuation of Securities                             Valuation of Securities                                                Given an Interest Rate         Fair Value           Given an Interest Rate                                              Decrease of X Basis Points          as of            Increase of X Basis Points Issuer                                  (150 BPS)    (100 BPS)     (50 BPS)  July 29,2000     50 BPS       100 BPS       150 BPS ------                                  ---------    ---------     --------  ------------     ------       -------       ------- U.S. government notes and bonds         $2,350       $2,329        $2,307      $2,285         $2,262       $2,240        $2,218  State, municipal, and county    government notes and bonds             3,666        3,632         3,598       3,564          3,529        3,494         3,459  Corporate notes and bonds                3,296        3,266         3,235       3,204          3,173        3,141         3,110                                          ------       ------        ------      ------         ------       ------        ------     Total                                $9,312       $9,227        $9,140      $9,053         $8,964       $8,875        $8,787                                          ======       ======        ======      ======         ======       ======        ====== A 50 BPS move in the Federal Funds Rate has occurred in nine of the last 10 years; a 100 BPS move in the Federal Funds Rate has occurred in six of the last 10 years; and a 150 BPS move in the Federal Funds Rate has occurred in four of the last 10 years.  The following analysis presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of public equity investments that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the hypothetical change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in each stock's price. Stock price fluctuations of plus or minus 15%, plus or minus 35%, and plus or minus 50% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence.                                         39 40  The following table estimates the fair value of the publicly traded corporate equities at a 12-month horizon (in millions): Valuation of Securities                           Valuation of Securities                                                  Given X% Decrease                                Given X% Increase                                                in Each Stock's Price            Fair Value       in Each Stock's Price                                       --------------------------------------       as of     ----------------------------------                                           (50%)         (35%)        (15%)     July 29, 2000    15%          35%          50%                                       -----------   -----------   ----------  -------------- ----------  -----------   -------- Corporate equities                       $3,112         $4,046       $5,291       $6,225        $7,159       $8,404      $9,337 Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the S&P Index or companies traded on the NASDAQ National Market. The NASDAQ Composite Index has shown a 15% movement in each of the last three years and a 35% and 50% movement in at least one of the last three years.  We also have an investment in KPMG Consulting, Inc. in the principal amount of $1.05 billion of Series A Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, which carries a 6% dividend rate on the original issue price until converted to common stock. Conversion is at our option upon or after the completion of an initial public offering of KPMG Consulting, Inc. We have not included the investment in the above sensitivity analyses due to the nature of this investment.                                          40 41   LEASES  We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases on our facilities where payments are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). We have evaluated the hypothetical change in lease obligations held at July 29, 2000 due to changes in the LIBOR. The modeling technique used measures hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the LIBOR. The hypothetical market changes reflected immediate parallel shifts in the LIBOR curve of plus or minus 50 BPS, 100 BPS, and 150 BPS over a 12-month period. The results of this analysis were not material in comparison to our financial results.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS  We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities, primarily denominated in Australian, Canadian, Japanese, Korean, and several European currencies, primarily the euro and British pound. We also periodically hedge anticipated transactions with purchased currency options.  The foreign exchange forward and option contracts we enter into generally have original maturities ranging from one to three months. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts for trading purposes. We do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).                                         41 42    ITEM 8.

Cisco solutions provide competitive advantage to our customers through more efficient and timely exchange of information, which in turn leads to cost savings, process efficiencies, and closer relationships with their customers, prospects, business partners, suppliers, and employees. These solutions form the networking foundation for companies, universities, utilities, and government agencies worldwide.  2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FISCAL YEAR The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 were 52-week, 53-week, and 52-week fiscal years, respectively.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents are custodied with three major financial institutions.  INVESTMENTS The Company's investments comprise U.S., state, and municipal government obligations; corporate debt securities; and public corporate equity securities. Investments with maturities of less than one year are considered short-term and are carried at fair value. All investments are primarily held in the Company's name and custodied with two major financial institutions. The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed. At July 29, 2000 and July 31, 1999, substantially all of the Company's investments were classified as available for sale. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of any related tax effect.                                         46 47  The Company also has certain other minority investments in nonpublicly traded companies. These investments are included in other assets on the Company's balance sheet and are generally carried at cost. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.  INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis.  RESTRICTED INVESTMENTS Restricted investments consist of U.S. government obligations with maturities of more than one year. These investments are carried at fair value and are restricted as to withdrawal. Restricted investments are held in the Company's name and custodied with two major financial institutions.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accrued compensation, and other accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair values of investments are determined using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments.  CONCENTRATIONS Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with three major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal risk.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, does not require collateral from its customers.  The Company receives certain of its components from sole suppliers. Additionally, the Company relies on a limited number of hardware manufacturers. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results.  REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Revenue from service obligations is deferred and generally recognized ratably over the period of the obligation. The Company makes certain sales to partners in two-tier distribution channels. These partners are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. The Company recognizes                                         47 48  revenue to two-tier distributors based on estimates which approximate the point products have been sold by the distributors and also maintains accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs. The Company accrues for warranty costs, sales returns, and other allowances based on its experience.  LEASE RECEIVABLES Cisco provides a variety of lease financing services to its customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Lease receivables represent the principal balance remaining in sales-type and direct-financing leases under these programs. These leases typically have two to three year terms and are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.  ADVERTISING COSTS The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Software development costs, which are required to be capitalized pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed," have not been material to date.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of 24 to 30 months are used on computer equipment and related software and production and engineering equipment and five years for office equipment, furniture, and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the shorter of the remaining lease term or five years.  GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years.  INCOME TAXES Income tax expense is based on pre-tax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.                                          48 49  COMPUTATION OF NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE Basic net income per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of stock options. Share and per-common share data for all periods presented reflect the two-for-one stock split effective March 2000.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments recorded directly to a separate component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, translation adjustments are recorded in income.  DERIVATIVES The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. All foreign exchange forward contracts are highly inversely correlated to the hedged items and are designated as, and considered effective as, hedges of the underlying assets or liabilities. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in interest and other income, net, and offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of intercompany balances or other current assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. Fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts are determined using published rates. If a derivative contract terminates prior to maturity, the investment is shown at its fair value with the resulting gain or loss reflected in interest and other income, net. The Company periodically hedges anticipated transactions with purchased currency options. The premium paid is amortized over the life of the option while any intrinsic value is recognized in income during the same period as the hedged transaction.  MINORITY INTEREST Minority interest represents the preferred stockholders' proportionate share of the equity of Cisco Systems, K.K. (Japan). At July 29, 2000, the Company owned all issued and outstanding common stock amounting to 73.2% of the voting rights. Each share of preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock at any time at the option of the holder.                                         49 50  USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory allowances, depreciation and amortization, sales returns, warranty costs, taxes, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Management does not expect the initial adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material effect on the Company's operations or financial position. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 133 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.  In September 1999, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D-83, "Accounting for Payroll Taxes Associated with Stock Option Exercises" ("EITF D-83"). EITF D-83 requires that payroll tax paid on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with an employee's exercise of stock options be recorded as operating expenses. Payroll tax on stock option exercises of $51 million was expensed in fiscal 2000.  In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101, as amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying                                         50 51  generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. At this time, management does not expect the adoption of SAB 101 to have a material effect on the Company's operations or financial position; however, the SEC's final guidance for implementation has not been released to date. The Company is required to adopt SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.  RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform to the current year presentation.  3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  POOLING OF INTERESTS COMBINATIONS  In fiscal 2000, the Company acquired StratumOne Communications, Inc. ("StratumOne"); TransMedia Communications, Inc. ("TransMedia"); Cerent Corporation ("Cerent"); WebLine Communications Corporation ("WebLine"); SightPath, Inc. ("SightPath"); InfoGear Technology Corporation ("InfoGear"); and ArrowPoint Communications, Inc. ("ArrowPoint"), which were accounted for as poolings of interests. All historical financial information has been restated to reflect these acquisitions. In addition, the historical financial information has been restated to reflect the acquisition of Fibex Systems ("Fibex"), which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 and accounted for as a pooling of interests. These transactions are summarized as follows (in millions): Shares of                                                           Cisco Stock                                                        Issued, Including     Fair Value of Acquisition Date           Acquired Company             Options Assumed       Acquisition ----------------           ----------------             ---------------       ----------- May 1999                   Fibex                               11.5            $   314 September 1999             StratumOne                          13.3            $   435 September 1999             TransMedia                          13.9            $   407 November 1999              Cerent                             200.0            $ 6,900 November 1999              WebLine                              8.6            $   325 May 2000                   SightPath                           11.4            $   800 June 2000                  InfoGear                             4.7            $   301 June 2000                  ArrowPoint                          90.2            $ 5,700 All of these acquired companies used a calendar year end. In order for all companies to operate on the same fiscal year, operations for the one-month period ending July 31, 1999, which were not significant to the Company, have been reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in fiscal 2000. No significant adjustments were necessary to conform accounting policies. However, the companies' historical results have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of previously provided valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. There were no intercompany                                         51 52  transactions requiring elimination in any period presented.

The transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and all periods presented prior to fiscal 1999 were restated.                                         52 53  OTHER POOLING OF INTERESTS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AS OF JULY 29, 2000  The Company has also completed a number of other pooling transactions during the three years ended July 29, 2000. The historical operations of these entities were not material to the Company's consolidated operations on either an individual or aggregate basis; therefore, prior period statements have not been restated for these acquisitions. These transactions are summarized as follows (in millions): Shares of                                                          Cisco Stock                                                       Issued, Including     Fair Value of Fiscal Year                  Acquired Company          Options Assumed       Acquisition -----------                  ----------------          ---------------       ----------- 1998                         Precept Software, Inc.          6.0                $  84 1999                         Sentient Networks, Inc.         4.0                $ 131 2000                         Cocom A/S                       1.9                $  66 2000                         V-Bits, Inc.                    2.8                $ 128 2000                         Growth Networks, Inc.           5.6                $ 355 2000                         Altiga Networks, Inc.           6.3                $ 335 2000                         Compatible Systems                              Corporation                     3.8                $ 232 PURCHASE COMBINATIONS  During the three years ended July 29, 2000, the Company completed a number of purchase acquisitions. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or an aggregate basis.                                         53 54  The amounts allocated to in-process research and development ("in-process R&D") were determined through established valuation techniques in the high-technology communications equipment industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. Amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding five years.

LINE OF CREDIT  At July 29, 2000, the Company had a syndicated credit agreement under the terms of which a group of banks committed a maximum of $500 million on an unsecured, revolving basis for borrowings of various maturities. The commitments made under this agreement expire on July 1, 2002. Under the terms of the agreement, borrowings bear interest at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate based on certain financial criteria and third-party rating assessments. As of July 29, 2000, this spread was 17.5 basis points. From this spread, a commitment fee of 5.5 basis points is assessed against any undrawn amounts. The agreement includes a single financial covenant that places a variable floor on tangible net worth, as defined, if certain leverage ratios are exceeded. There have been no borrowings under this agreement to date.                                         58 59   8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LEASES  The Company has entered into several agreements to lease 448 acres of land located in San Jose, California, where it has established its headquarters operations, and 759 acres of land located in Boxborough, Massachusetts; Salem, New Hampshire; Richardson, Texas; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where it has expanded certain research and development and customer-support activities.  All of the leases have initial terms of five to seven years and options to renew for an additional three to five years, subject to certain conditions. At any time during the terms of these leases, the Company may purchase the land. If the Company elects not to purchase the land at the end of each of the leases, the Company has guaranteed a residual value of $624 million.  The Company has also entered into agreements to lease certain buildings standing or to be constructed on the land described above. The lessors of the buildings have committed to fund up to a maximum of $1.40 billion (subject to reductions based on certain conditions in the respective leases) for the construction of the buildings, with the portion of the committed amount actually used to be determined by the Company. Rent obligations for the buildings commenced on various dates and will expire at the same time as the land leases.  The Company has options to renew the building leases for an additional three to five years, subject to certain conditions. The Company may, at its option, purchase the buildings during or at the end of the terms of the leases at approximately the amount expended by the lessors to construct the buildings. If the Company does not exercise the purchase options by the end of the leases, the Company will guarantee a residual value of the buildings as determined at the lease inception date of each agreement (approximately $748 million at July 29, 2000).  As part of the above lease transactions, the Company restricted $1.29 billion of its investment securities as collateral for specified obligations of the lessors under the leases. These investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under the Company's investment policy. In addition, the Company must maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, as defined.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS  The Company conducts business on a global basis in several major currencies. As such, it is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of certain currency exposures. These contracts hedge exposures associated with nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities denominated in Australian, Canadian, Japanese, Korean, and several European currencies, primarily the euro and British pound.  The Company does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in interest and other income, net, and offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of intercompany balances or other current assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. The Company's foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to three months in original maturity.                                          60 61  The Company periodically hedges anticipated transactions with purchased currency options. A purchased currency option's premium is amortized over the life of the option while any intrinsic value is recognized in income during the same period as the hedged transaction. The deferred premium and intrinsic value from hedging anticipated transactions were not material at July 29, 2000. In the unlikely event that the underlying transaction terminates or becomes improbable, the remaining premium or deferred intrinsic value will be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not purchase currency options for trading purposes. Foreign exchange forward and option contracts as of July 29, 2000 are summarized as follows (in millions): Notional      Carrying         Fair                                      Amount         Value          Value                                     ---------      --------       ------- Forward contracts:     Assets                          $   1,377      $     (5)      $    (15)     Liabilities                     $   1,500      $     12       $     37 Option contracts:     Assets                          $     561      $     12       $     14 The Company's foreign exchange forward and option contracts contain credit risk to the extent that its bank counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. The Company minimizes such risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one party resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect any material losses as a result of default by other parties.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  AUTHORIZED SHARES  On November 10, 1999, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase to the authorized number of shares of common stock from 5.40 billion to 10 billion shares. On March 20, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase to the authorized number of shares of common stock from 10 billion to 20                                         61 62  billion shares relating to the two-for-one stock split distributed on March 22, 2000.  STOCK SPLIT  The Board of Directors authorized the splitting of the Company's common stock on a two-for-one basis for shareholders of record on February 22, 2000 and the resulting shares from the split were distributed on March 22, 2000. All references to share and per-share data for all periods presented have been adjusted to give effect to this two-for-one stock split.  SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN  In June 1998, the Board of Directors approved a Shareholders' Rights Plan ("Rights Plan"). The Rights Plan is intended to protect shareholders' rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt. It is not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company on terms that are favorable and fair to all shareholders and will not interfere with a merger approved by the Board of Directors. Each right entitles shareholders to buy a unit equal to a portion of a new share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or a group acquires or announces a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the Company's common stock.  In the event the rights become exercisable, the Rights Plan allows for Cisco shareholders to acquire, at an exercise price of $108 per right owned, stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of $217, whether or not Cisco is the surviving corporation. The rights, which expire in June 2008, are redeemable for $0.00017 per right at the approval of the Board of Directors.  PREFERRED STOCK  Under the terms of the Company's Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of the Company's authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.                                         62 63  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  The components of comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows (in millions): July 29,        July 31,       July 25,  Years Ended                                               2000            1999           1998  -----------                                            ---------       ---------      --------- Net income                                             $   2,668       $   2,023      $   1,331  Other comprehensive income (loss):    Change in net unrealized gains on investments,      net of tax of $1,762, $144, and $17      in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively           3,240             234             25    Reclassification for net unrealized gains      previously included in net income, net of tax      of $2 in fiscal 1998                                      --              --              3                                                         ---------       ---------      ---------     Net unrealized gains                                    3,240             234             28     Change in accumulated translation adjustments              (8)              6            (10)                                                         ---------       ---------      ---------       Total                                             $   5,900       $   2,263      $   1,349                                                         =========       =========      ========= 10.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN  The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") under which 222 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. Eligible employees may purchase a limited number of shares of the Company's common stock at 85% of the market value at certain plan-defined dates. The Purchase Plan terminates on January 3, 2005. In fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, seven million, 10 million, and 14 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. At July 29, 2000, 123 million shares were available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.  EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS  The Company has two main stock option plans: the 1987 Stock Option Plan (the "Predecessor Plan") and the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1996 Plan").  The Predecessor Plan was terminated in 1996. All outstanding options under the Predecessor Plan were transferred to the 1996 Plan. However, all outstanding options under the Predecessor Plan continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the existing option agreements for those grants.  The maximum number of shares under the 1996 Plan was initially limited to the 620 million shares transferred from the Predecessor Plan. However, under the terms of the 1996 Plan, the share reserve increased each December for the three fiscal years beginning with fiscal 1997, by an amount equal to 4.75% of the outstanding shares on the last trading day of the immediately preceding November. In fiscal 1999, the Company's shareholders                                         63 64  approved the extension of the automatic share increase provision of the 1996 Plan for an additional three-year period.  Although the Board of Directors has the authority to set other terms, the options are generally 20% or 25% exercisable one year from the date of grant and then ratably over the following 48 or 36 months, respectively. Options issued under the Predecessor Plan generally had terms of four years. New options granted under the 1996 Plan expire no later than nine years from the grant date.

During fiscal 2000, a total of approximately 31 million shares of the Company's common stock have been reserved for issuance under the assumed plans and the related options are included in the preceding table.  In 1997, the Company adopted a Supplemental Stock Incentive Plan (the "Supplemental Plan") under which options can be granted or shares can be directly issued to eligible employees. Officers and members of the Company's Board of Directors are not eligible to participate in the Supplemental Plan. Nine million shares have been reserved for issuance under the Supplemental Plan, of which 9,000 shares are subject to outstanding options and 66,600 shares have been issued in fiscal 2000.                                         64 65   The following table summarizes information concerning outstanding and exercisable options at July 29, 2000 (in millions, except number of years and per-share amounts): Options Outstanding                         Options Exercisable                     -----------------------------------------------------   --------------------------------                                     Weighted-Average      Weighted-Average                  Weighted-Average    Range of           Number     Remaining Contractual    Exercise Price      Number        Exercise Price Exercise Prices     Outstanding     Life (in Years)          per Share      Exercisable        per Share ---------------     -----------  ----------------------  -----------------  -----------     ---------------- $ 0.01-5.56              229               5.20               $   5.23           188            $   4.44   5.57-12.27             258               6.16                   9.56           162                8.95  12.28-28.61             194               7.49                  23.59            63               22.47  28.62-54.53             241               8.34                  49.91             5               31.02  54.54-72.56              49               8.64                  65.65            --                  --                         ----               ----               --------           ---            -------- Total                    971               6.87               $  24.19           418            $   9.22                         ====               ====               ========           ===            ======== At July 31, 1999 and July 25, 1998, approximately 370 million and 312 million outstanding options, respectively, were exercisable. The weighted-average exercise prices for outstanding options were $5.75 and $3.64 at July 31, 1999 and July 25, 1998, respectively.  The Company is required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), to disclose pro forma information regarding option grants made to its employees based on specified valuation techniques that produce estimated compensation charges. These amounts have not been reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations because no compensation charge arises when the price of the employees' stock options equals the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date, as in the case of options granted to the Company's employees. Pro forma information under SFAS 123 is as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts): July 29,   July 31,    July 25, Years Ended                                                                2000        1999       1998 -----------                                                                 ----        ----       ---- Net income--as reported                                                   $ 2,668    $ 2,023     $ 1,331 Net income--pro forma                                                     $ 1,549    $ 1,487     $ 1,074 Basic net income per common share--as reported                            $  0.39    $  0.30     $  0.21 Diluted net income per common share--as reported                          $  0.36    $  0.29     $  0.20 Basic net income per common share--pro forma                              $  0.22    $  0.22     $  0.17 Diluted net income per common share--pro forma                            $  0.21    $  0.21     $  0.16 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: Employee Stock Option Plans            Employee Stock Purchase Plan                                 ----------------------------------    -----------------------------------                                 July 29,    July 31,     July 25,     July 29,     July 31,      July 25,                                   2000        1999         1998         2000         1999          1998                                   ----        ----         ----         ----         ----          ---- Expected dividend            yield                     0.0%        0.0%         0.0%         0.0%         0.0%         0.0%          Risk-free interest            rate                      6.4%        5.1%         5.7%         5.3%         4.9%         5.4%          Expected volatility        33.9%       40.2%        35.6%        43.3%        47.2%        44.8%          Expected life            (in years)                3.1         3.1          3.1          0.5          0.5          0.5 65 66  The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The Company uses projected volatility rates which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company's options. The weighted-average estimated fair values of employee stock options granted during fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 were $19.44, $8.40, and $3.57 per share, respectively.  The above pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123 are also not likely to be representative of the effects on net income and net income per common share in future years, because they do not take into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to grants made prior to fiscal 1996.  EMPLOYEE 401(k) PLANS  The Company sponsors the Cisco Systems, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") to provide retirement benefits for its employees. As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. The Company also has other 401(k) plans that it sponsors. These plans arose from acquisitions of other companies and are not material to the Company on either an individual or aggregate basis.  Employees may contribute from 1% to 15% of their annual compensation to the Plan, limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions dollar for dollar up to a maximum of $1,500 per year per person. All matching contributions vest immediately. In addition, the Plan provides for discretionary contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are allocated among eligible participants in the proportion of their salaries to the total salaries of all participants. The Company's matching contributions to the Plan totaled $34 million, $20 million, and $15 million in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. No discretionary contributions were made in fiscal 2000, 1999, or 1998.                                           66 67  11.

The Company has provided a valuation allowance on certain of its deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock option exercises. Deferred tax assets of approximately $963 million at July 29, 2000 pertain to certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. When recognized, the tax benefit of these credits and losses will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.  As of July 29, 2000, the Company's federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $496 million and $865 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2005. As of July 29, 2000, the Company's federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $678 million and $197 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal and state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2005.                                         68 69  The Company's income taxes payable for federal, state, and foreign purposes have been reduced, and the deferred tax assets increased, by the tax benefits associated with dispositions of employee stock options. The Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of exercise and the option price, tax effected. These benefits were credited directly to shareholders' equity and amounted to $3.08 billion, $837 million, and $422 million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Benefits reducing taxes payable amounted to $2.49 billion, $837 million, and $422 million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Benefits increasing gross deferred tax assets amounted to $582 million in fiscal 2000.  12. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS  The Company's operations involve the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and technical support of networking products and services. The Company offers end-to-end networking solutions for its customers. Cisco products include routers, LAN and ATM switches, dial-up access servers, and network-management software. These products, integrated by the Cisco IOS(R) software, link geographically dispersed LANs, WANs, and IBM networks.  The Company conducts business globally and is managed geographically. The Company's management relies on an internal management system that provides sales and standard cost information by geographic theater. Sales are attributed to a theater based on the ordering location of the customer. The Company's management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from this internal management system. The Company does not allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to its geographic theaters as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the operating segments. Management does not believe that allocating these expenses is material in evaluating a geographic theater's performance. Information from this internal management system differs from the amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles due to certain corporate level adjustments not included in the internal management system. These corporate level adjustments are primarily sales adjustments relating to revenue deferrals and reserves, credit memos, returns, and other timing differences. Based on established criteria, the Company has four reportable segments: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); Asia Pacific; and Japan.                                         69 70  Summarized financial information by theater for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, as taken from the internal management system discussed previously, is as follows (in millions): July 29,     July 31,      July 25, Years Ended                                                        2000         1999          1998 -----------                                                        ----         ----          ---- Net sales:   Americas                                                     $  12,924     $   8,088    $   5,732   EMEA                                                             4,770         3,216        2,114   Asia Pacific                                                     1,705           825          535   Japan                                                              935           566          459   Sales adjustments                                               (1,406)         (522)        (351)                                                                ----------    ---------    ---------      Total                                                     $  18,928     $  12,173    $   8,489                                                                =========     =========    =========  Gross margin:   Americas                                                     $   9,412     $   5,836    $   4,261   EMEA                                                             3,581         2,380        1,565   Asia Pacific                                                     1,215           586          395   Japan                                                              737           436          340                                                                ---------     ---------    ---------     Standard margins                                              14,945         9,238        6,561   Sales adjustments                                               (1,406)         (522)        (351)   Production overhead                                               (455)         (255)        (207)   Manufacturing variances and other     related costs                                                   (902)         (547)        (438)                                                                ----------    ---------    ---------      Total                                                     $  12,182     $   7,914    $   5,565                                                                =========     =========    ========= The standard margins by geographic theater differ from the amounts recognized under generally accepted accounting principles because the Company does not allocate certain sales adjustments, production overhead, and manufacturing variances and other related costs to the theaters.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and of shareholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at July 29, 2000 and July 31, 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 29, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.    /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ------------------------------------ San Jose, California August 8, 2000                                         72 73                      SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL DATA(1) (Unaudited)                      (In millions, except per-share amounts) July 29,       April 29,    Jan. 29,      Oct. 30,      July 31,       May 1,       Jan. 23,     Oct. 24,                           2000          2000          2000          1999          1999          1999          1999         1998                         --------      --------      --------      --------      --------      --------      --------     -------- Net sales               $  5,720      $  4,933      $  4,357      $  3,918      $  3,558      $  3,172      $  2,845     $  2,598 Gross margin               3,662         3,172         2,818         2,530         2,297         2,059         1,857        1,701 Net income              $    796(2)   $    641(3)   $    816(4)   $    415(5)   $    605(6)   $    632(7)   $    279(8)  $    507(9) Net income per common   share--basic*         $   0.11      $   0.09      $   0.12      $   0.06      $   0.09      $   0.09      $   0.04     $   0.08 Net income per common   share--diluted*       $   0.11(2)   $   0.08(3)   $   0.11(4)   $   0.06(5)   $   0.08(6)   $   0.09(7)   $   0.04(8)  $   0.07(9) * Reflects the two-for-one stock split effective March 2000.
