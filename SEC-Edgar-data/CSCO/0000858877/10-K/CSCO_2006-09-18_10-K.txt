We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.
PART I ITEM 1. Business General We design, manufacture and sell networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry and provide services associated with these products and their use. Our products are installed at corporations, public institutions, telecommunications companies, and businesses of all sizes and are also found in personal residences. We provide a broad line of products for transporting data, voice, and video within buildings, across campuses, and around the world. We conduct our business globally and are managed geographically in five segments: the United States and Canada; European Markets; Emerging Markets; Asia Pacific; and Japan. For revenue and other information regarding these segments, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated into this report by reference.
On February 24, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. (Scientific-Atlanta), a provider of set-top boxes, end-to-end video distribution networks and video system integration. With this acquisition, we have added video to the convergence of data, voice and mobility technologies which enables us to be a stronger strategic business partner with our service provider customers, as well as reach a broad range of consumers with our products.
We were incorporated in California in December 1984, and our headquarters are in San Jose, California. The mailing address of our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our Website is www.cisco.com . Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our Website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All such filings are available free of charge.
Products and Services We sell Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry that address a wide range of customers needs, including improving 1 Table of Contents productivity, reducing cost and gaining a competitive advantage. Our corresponding technology focus is on delivering networking products and solutions that simplify customers infrastructures, offer integrated services and a high degree of security. Our products and services help customers build their own network infrastructures while providing tools to allow them to communicate with key stakeholders including customers, prospects, business partners, suppliers and employees.
Our products are used individually or as an integrated suite to connect personal and business computing devices to networks or computer networks with each otherwhether they are within a building, across a campus, or around the world. Our breadth of product and service offerings across multiple technology segments enables us to offer a wide range of products and services to meet customer requirements. We also provide products and services that allow customers to transition their various networks to a single multiservice data, voice, and video network, enabling economies of scale.
We refer to some of our products and technologies as advanced technologies, and we believe some of these advanced technologies may grow over time to become material contributors to our overall business. Each of these advanced technologies, in addition to our core switching and routing businesses, builds upon our existing competencies and allows us to expand the overall market for our products and services. We have currently identified the following advanced technologies: application networking services, home networking, hosted small-business systems, optical networking, security, storage area networking, unified communications, video systems and wireless technology. We are in the process of identifying additional advanced technologies for focus and investment in the future, and our investments in some presently identified advanced technologies may be curtailed or eliminated depending on market developments. Our sales of optical networking products will no longer be included in our advanced technologies product category beginning in fiscal 2007 and instead will be included in the other product category.
Over time, we believe that the Internet and the various networks associated with it, including corporate intranets, cable, broadband and dialup networks, and voice and video networks, will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated, intelligent system or, as we refer to it, an Intelligent Information Network. This is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems. In this evolving environment, we believe successful vendors will be capable of providing a broad spectrum of products aimed not at a particular technology platform but at solutions to networking problems that span all segments. As such, many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an Intelligent Information Network would demand, making the Network the Platform for the next generation of value added communications. For a discussion of the risks associated with that strategy, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factor entitled We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer. For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated into this report by reference.
Our offerings fall into several categories: Routing Routing technology is the foundation for Internet and intranet. Routers interconnect computer networks, moving information such as data, voice, and video from one network to another. Our routing products offer features designed to increase the intelligence, security, reliability, scalability, and level of performance in the transmission of information. We offer a broad range of routers, from core network infrastructure for service providers and large businesses to access routers for the service-rich branch to home network deployments for consumers.
2 Table of Contents Switching Switching is another integral networking technology that is used in buildings and campuses to build local-area networks (LANs), across cities to build metropolitan-area networks (MANs), and across great distances to build wide-area networks (WANs). Our switching systems offer many forms of connectivity to end users, workstations, and servers, and function as aggregators on LANs, MANs, and WANs. Our systems employ several widely used technologies including Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode, packet over Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), and Multiprotocol Label Switching.
Advanced Technologies Application Networking Services This technology combines application delivery with our application-oriented networking to help information technology (IT) departments integrate their applications, and improve the security and delivery of critical applications to users across the enterprise. Our application networking services products are designed to address increasingly complex IT problems, such as integration and security, by evolving the existing enterprise network infrastructure to scale, deliver, optimize, and integrate applications.
Home Networking Home networking products connect different devices in the household, through wired or wireless connections, allowing users to share Internet access, printers, music, movies, and games throughout the home. Our products include voice and data modems, routers, network cards, media adapters, Internet video cameras, network storage, USB adapters, and other products that enable customers to share an Internet connection or move digital content around their homes or small-office environments. These products are sold through Linksys and Scientific-Atlanta.
Hosted Small-Business Systems This solution combines products and services designed to provide small businesses with voice, video, and data networking, along with business applications and Internet access, through a single high-speed connection from a service provider. Hosted small-business systems include integrated voice and data products on the customers premises combined with with security, quality of service (QoS) provisions for voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and video, and monitoring and management services, all hosted and delivered by the telecommunications provider.
Optical Networking We provide optical networking products for both the enterprise and service provider markets. We support optical technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH), dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), and coarse wavelength-division multiplexing (CWDM), which are used to scale optical bandwidth as high-bandwidth applications such as Gigabit Ethernet, voice, video, and storage become more commonplace. Scientific-Atlanta markets and sells analog and digital optoelectronics which may reside in a network operators headend, in other facilities such as distribution hubs, and in optical nodes. Optical networking will no longer be included in our advanced technologies product category beginning in fiscal 2007.
Security We provide a wide range of network security products and services that offer protection to critical information systems from unauthorized use, defend against attack, and minimize the effect of Internet-borne worms and viruses. As part of our Self-Defending Network strategy, we offer numerous network security 3 Table of Contents technologies embedded within our routers and switches, in standalone security appliances, and as host-based software agents with central management and analysis. Our network security product and service offerings are designed to help ensure the end-to-end integrity of the information network, simplify operations, and lower total cost of ownership.
Storage Area Networking We provide storage area networking products that deliver standards-based connectivity between servers and storage systems, including products such as arrays and tape drives. Our products incorporate intelligent network features, such as advanced network security, traffic management, virtualization, and tools that are designed to help make storing, retrieving, and protecting critical data across widely distributed environments more efficient.
Unified Communications Cisco Unified Communications is an integrated system that provides voice, video, data, and Web services over a highly secure, standards-based IP network. Specific products include IP phones, client software, and servers and network appliances supporting call control, contact centers, messaging, conferencing, and collaboration. Cisco Unified Communications products are available as standalone software or devices and as integrated components in Ciscos routers and switches. Together, they support traditional phone calls; voicemail and unified messaging; audio, video, and Web conferencing and collaboration; and customer call centers. By enabling and accelerating the growing convergence of traditional communication methods with mobility and presence and preference information, Unified Communications solutions deliver both cost savings and enhanced personal and business productivity. Cisco Unified Communications solutions are sold to and used by both large corporations and small and medium-sized business; they were previously referred to as enterprise IP communications.
Video Systems Our video systems consist primarily of digital set-top boxes, digital media technology products, and transport and access products. Digital set-top boxes provide video entertainment services to consumers. They enable subscribers to access a variety of interactive digital television services developed either by Cisco or third parties. Our equipment includes Standard-Definition (SD) basic digital set-tops, DOCSIS (Data Over Cable System Interface Specification) Set-top Gateway (DSG) digital set-tops, High-Definition (HD) digital set-tops, Digital Video Recorder (DVR) set-tops, HD-DVR set-tops, Multi-Room DVR set-tops, Media Center DVR set-tops, and Digital-only set-tops. Digital media technology products span a wide range of signal processing and headend capabilities including reception, encoding or transcoding, transrating, multiplexing, ad insertion, switching, and modulation. Deployment of these capabilities can help service providers and broadcast customers to more efficiently deliver entertainment, information, and communications services over their existing access networks. These products are sold primarily through Scientific-Atlanta.
Wireless Technology We offer a wide variety of in-building and outdoor wireless networking products. These products include access points, wireless LAN controllers, wireless integrated switches and routers, wireless management software, wireless LAN clients and client software, bridges, antennas, and accessories. Our wireless networking products are designed to provide high-performance and highly secure, manageable, and reliable wireless LANs that enable mobility and increase productivity.
Other Products Our other products are comprised primarily of access, service provider IP communications, and network management software products.
4 Table of Contents Service In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services help ensure that our products operate efficiently, remain highly available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system software. These services help customers protect their network investments and minimize downtime for systems running mission-critical applications. Advanced services are services that are part of a comprehensive program that is designed to provide responsive, preventive, and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. The advanced services program supports networking devices, applications, and complete infrastructures.
Customers and Markets Our customers networking needs are influenced by numerous factors, including the size of the organization, number and types of computer systems, geographic location, and the applications requiring communications. Our customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry, geography or market segment. In each of the past three fiscal years, no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales. Our customers are primarily in the following markets: Large Enterprise Businesses We define large enterprise businesses generally as regional, national, or global organizations with 1,000 or more employees working in multiple locations or branch offices. They have complex IT infrastructures and networking needs within a multivendor environment. Our large enterprise customers include government, education, and healthcare organizations and retail, finance, manufacturing, and transportation entities. We create and deliver routing, switching, network security, unified communications, mobility, storage, and other products and services in collaboration with third-party application and hardware vendors and channel partners. We also offer a wide variety of services, including service and support packages, financing, and managed network service offerings through our service provider partners.
Service Providers Service providers offer data, voice, and video communication services to businesses, governments, utilities and consumers. They include regional, national, and international telecommunications carriers as well as Internet, cable, and wireless service providers. Service providers use a variety of our routing, switching, optical, storage, security, video systems, and network management products in their own core networks. Compared to other end-user customers, service provider customers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services due to the scale and complexity of their networks. Additionally, many service providers offer managed network services incorporating our products for their residential, enterprise and commercial customers.
Commercial We define commercial customers primarily as small and medium-sized businesses having fewer than 1,000 employees and a need for networks of their own, as well as for connections to the Internet and to business partners. Smaller organizations generally have limited resources and expertise in networking technology. Therefore, we attempt to provide products that are affordable and easy to install and use. The commercial market remains an area of potential growth for network adoption and deployment of intelligent networking.
Consumer Consumer customers, primarily individuals and businesses operating in small offices or home offices, have infrastructure and networking needs on a smaller scale.
5 Table of Contents Sales Overview As of the end of fiscal 2006, our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 17,000 individuals, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in more than 70 countries and sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our sales force. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, distributors, and retail partners.
Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. A number of service providers are also systems integrators.
Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. In addition, Linksys home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners. We refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. These distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms which allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.
For information regarding risks related to our channels, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factors entitled Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins and Our inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factors entitled Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment, Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our costs, expenses, and financial condition, We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows and Man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
Our service offerings complement our products via a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers. We facilitate and provide lease and other financing through our wholly owned subsidiaries to certain qualified customers for the purchase of equipment and other needs. For additional information regarding these financing activities, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated into this report by reference.
Backlog Our backlog at July29, 2006, the last day of our 2006 fiscal year, was approximately $3.0 billion, compared with backlog of approximately $2.0 billion at July30, 2005, the last day of our 2005 fiscal year. Scientific-Atlanta contributed approximately $400 million of the backlog at July29, 2006. Backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders (which are made without significant penalty), we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period.
6 Table of Contents Acquisitions, Investments, and Alliances The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services. Through acquisitions, investments, and alliances we are able to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets.
We employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking products and services: we develop new technologies and products internally; we enter into joint-development efforts with other companies; we resell other companies products; and we acquire all or parts of other companies.
Acquisitions We have acquired many companies, and we expect to make future acquisitions. For example, we acquired Scientific-Atlanta in February 2006 for a total purchase price of approximately $7.1 billion. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product. No assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factor entitled We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.
Investments in Privately Held Companies We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factor entitled We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.
Strategic Alliances We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets. The objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new-market creation. Currently, we have strategic alliances with Accenture Ltd; AT&T Corp.; BearingPoint, Inc.; Cap Gemini S.A.; Electronic Data Systems Corporation; EMC Corporation; Ericsson; Fujitsu Limited; Hewlett-Packard Company; Intel Corporation; International Business Machines Corporation; Italtel SpA; Microsoft Corporation; Motorola, Inc.; Siemens AG; and Sprint Nextel Corporation; among others.
Competition We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services for transporting data, voice, and video traffic across intranets, extranets, and the Internet. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets. As we continue to expand our sales globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially China, and we anticipate this will continue.
7 Table of Contents Our competitors include 3Com; Alcatel; Avaya; Avici Systems; Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies; Ciena; D-Link Corporation; Dell; Enterasys Networks; Extreme Networks; F5 Networks, Inc.; Force10 Networks, Inc.; Foundry Networks; Fujitsu; Hewlett-Packard Company; Huawei Technologies; Juniper Networks; Lucent Technologies; McDATA Corporation; Motorola, Inc.; NETGEAR, Inc.; Nokia; Nortel Networks; Redback Networks; Siemens AG; Sycamore Networks; and Symbol Technologies, Inc. among others.
Some of these companies compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:  The ability to provide a broad range of networking products and services  Product performance  Price  The ability to introduce new products, including products with price-performance advantages  The ability to reduce production costs  The ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection  Conformance to standards  Market presence  The ability to provide financing We also face competition from customers to whom we license or supply technology and suppliers from whom we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.
Research and Development We regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including, routers, switches, advanced technologies, and other product technologies. Our research and development expenditures were $4.1 billion, $3.3 billion, and $3.2 billion in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. All of our expenditures for research and development costs, as well as in-process research and development of $91 million, $26 million, and $3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, have been expensed as incurred.
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of internetworking products, including 8 Table of Contents universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies. We intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge. Still, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance.
Manufacturing We primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services, although we continue to operate Scientific-Atlantas manufacturing facilities, including its principal facility in Juarez, Mexico. Scientific-Atlantas manufacturing operations range from automated assembly lines for volume production to complete assembly of a particular product by one individual or small group of individuals. Our remaining manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials and components, subassemblies, final assembly, and testing of products. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, and product repair as well as product assembly. Proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is installed in our systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. We also use automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to ISO 9001 or ISO 9003 standards.
Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. During fiscal 2006, we began a transition to what we refer to as a lean manufacturing model. Lean manufacturing is an industry-standard model that seeks to drive efficiency and flexibility in manufacturing processes and in the broader supply chain. Over time, consistent with what we have experienced thus far, we expect this process will result in incremental increases in purchase commitments with corresponding decreases in core manufacturing inventory.
We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis, primarily annually. These arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time.
Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our 9 Table of Contents products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factors entitled Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce, We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others, and We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.
Employees As of July29, 2006, we employed 49,926 employees, including 13,126 in manufacturing and service, 15,288 in engineering, 17,322 in sales and marketing, and 4,190 in finance and administration. Approximately 19,600 employees are in locations outside the United States. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.
10 Table of Contents ITEM1A. Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. These factors include:  Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to Internet businesses and telecommunications service providers, in part due to the changing global economic environment  Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers spending plans and associated revenue  Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments  Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation  The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers  The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products and our success in new markets, including emerging and advanced technologies, as well as the adoption of new networking standards  Variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold  The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers  Manufacturing and customer lead times  Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to this as described below  Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  The ability of our customers, channel partners, and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  The timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on our employees gains on stock options exercised  Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements  How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans  Benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and manufacturing activities  Changes in accounting rules, such as recording expenses for employee stock option grants and changes in tax accounting principles As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.
11 Table of Contents OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE UNCERTAIN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT Economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and may impact our business, resulting in:  Reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on information technology-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers  Increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products  Risk of excess and obsolete inventories  Excess facilities and manufacturing capacity  Higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense Recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, including terrorist activities and military actions, particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding Iraq, and changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If the economic and market conditions in the United States and globally do not improve, or if they deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
OUR REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict. Our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or may decline. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings, or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
In addition, to improve customer satisfaction, we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results. Long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively.
We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.
Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.
12 Table of Contents WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO VARY OVER TIME, AND OUR LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE Our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:  Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group  Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages  Our ability to reduce production costs  Entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta, or internal development  Sales discounts  Increases in material or labor costs  Excess inventory and inventory holding charges  Obsolescence charges  Changes in shipment volume  Loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand  Lower than expected benefits from value engineering  Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially China  Changes in distribution channels  Increased warranty costs  How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, distributors, and retail partners. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. In addition, home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners. We refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. These distributors and retail partners are generally 13 Table of Contents given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. Although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.
Some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following:  We compete with some of our channel partners through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products  Some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear  Some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS INVENTORY MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS We must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND WEAKNESS IN SALES ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies, in addition to longer sales cycles. We have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers as market conditions have changed. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years, weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Slowdowns in the general economy, overcapacity, changes in the service provider market, regulatory developments, and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers, with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion 14 Table of Contents plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results, and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of service including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.
A SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR CAUSE A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL ORDERS, AND OUR FAILURE TO ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, or strong demand in the industry for those parts, especially if the economy grows. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.
We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future:  New markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity  As we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent, at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  We face competition for certain components, which are supply-constrained, from existing competitors and companies in other markets Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints, including those caused by any possible disruption related to our implementation of lean manufacturing, could be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help assure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information regarding our purchase commitments, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders.
15 Table of Contents A reduction or interruption in supply; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease.
The fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our operating results. Financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely, or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs.
Our key manufacturing facilities for Scientific-Atlantas products are located in Juarez, Mexico, and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of this facility.
THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE GROWTH For information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled Competition contained in Item1 of this report.
WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. We believe that the Internet and the various networks associated with it, including corporate intranets, cable, broadband and dialup networks, and voice and video networks will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated, intelligent system, or as we refer to it, an Intelligent Information Network. This is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems. As such, many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an Intelligent Information Network would demand. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems does not emerge as we believe it will, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, net sales, and earnings. The success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Specifically, the products and technologies that we identify as emerging technologies or advanced technologies may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or advanced technologies.
16 Table of Contents WE ARE INCREASING OUR INVESTMENT IN ENGINEERING AND SALES ACTIVITIES AND THESE INVESTMENTS MAY ACHIEVE DELAYED, OR LOWER THAN EXPECTED, BENEFITS WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS We intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to both our engineering and sales functions as we focus on developing emerging technologies, the next wave of advanced technologies, growing the commercial market segment, capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities, enhancing our evolving support model and increasing our market share gains. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the Internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on the continued growth of the Internet. To the extent that an economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be certain performance problems with Internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. Because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business.
CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO CHARGES RELATED TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.
WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:  Difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products, such as Scientific-Atlanta 17 Table of Contents  Diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions  Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development  Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans Acquisitions may also cause us to:  Issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  Use a substantial portion of our cash resources or incur debt as we did recently when we issued and sold $6.5 billion in senior unsecured notes to fund our acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta  Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition  Assume liabilities  Record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  Incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses  Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
From time to time, we have made acquisitions that resulted in in-process research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter. These charges may occur in any particular quarter, resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain, and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. Please see the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer for additional information.
ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS As we focus on new market opportunitiesfor example, storage; wireless; security; and transporting data, voice, and video traffic across the same networkwe will increasingly compete with large telecommunications 18 Table of Contents equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past. Demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, entry into other markets, including our entry into the consumer market, has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence.
PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND NET INCOME We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. In the past, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. Although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past, there can be no assurance that such a remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.
INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR COSTS, EXPENSES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the United States, maintain a manufacturing facility for a substantial portion of our video systems products in Juarez, Mexico, and also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners. For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we derived approximately 47.5% and 48.8%, respectively, of our net sales from sales outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including, among others, foreign currency exchange rates; political or social unrest, economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region; environmental and trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our products from, or sell our products in various countries, such as, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) adopted in February 2003 by the European Union and subsequently by certain other countries; political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns; health or 19 Table of Contents similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our costs, expenses, and financial condition.
WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and certain non-dollar-denominated operating expenses in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.
Currently, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our net income.
WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. We expect demand for customer financing to continue. We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services and for working capital purposes. We do not recognize revenue on customer loan financing arrangements until cash payments are received.
Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if there is an economic slowdown. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. There have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners. These distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. We maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. However, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations.
20 Table of Contents OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the 21 Table of Contents need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption technology, sales taxes on Internet product sales, and access charges for Internet service providers. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES Changes in telecommunications requirements in the United States or other countries could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe that there may be future changes in U.S. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with various Federal Communications Commission requirements and regulations. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
FAILURE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Stock option grants are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123(R) or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In addition, companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to 22 Table of Contents predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved, see Item3, Legal Proceedings, contained in Part I of this report.
CHANGES IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. Further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment commitments made by us, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet such commitments could adversely impact our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities, including one of our manufacturing facilities, are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
MANMADE PROBLEMS SUCH AS COMPUTER VIRUSES OR TERRORISM MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance. In addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the U.S. and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Similarly, events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Part of this portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged. If the public equities market 23 Table of Contents declines, we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary. For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated by reference into this report. Our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies.
IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, these alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.
WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXPENSE THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE MEASURES ACCURATELY THE VALUE OF OUR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS, AND THE RECOGNITION OF THIS EXPENSE COULD CAUSE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE On July31, 2005, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation based on estimated fair values. As a result, starting with fiscal 2006, our operating results contain a charge for stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases. This charge is in addition to stock-based compensation expense we have recognized in prior periods related to acquisitions and investments. The application of SFAS 123(R) requires the use of an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of share-based payment awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in managements opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with SFAS 123(R) and SAB 107 using an option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.
As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R), beginning with fiscal 2006, our earnings were lower than they would have been had we not been required to adopt SFAS 123(R). This will continue to be the case for future periods. We cannot predict the effect that this adverse impact on our reported operating results will have on the trading price of our common stock.
24 Table of Contents OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.
WE HAVE ISSUED $6.5 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED On February22, 2006, we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $6.5 billion that mature at specific dates in 2009, 2011 and 2016. The notes that mature in 2009 bear floating-rate interest payable quarterly while the notes that mature in 2011 and 2016 bear fixed-rate interest payable semi-annually. We have entered into certain interest rate swaps to, in effect, convert the interest rates of the fixed interest notes into floating-rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Higher short-term interest rates would accordingly result in increased interest expense. While we presently mitigate this risk by investing a portion of our interest-bearing assetsin instruments with similar interest rate characteristics as the swapped debt, there can be no assurance that we will maintain a matched portfolio in the future. The instruments governing the notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. We have not previously undertaken substantial amounts of debt for borrowed money. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources, including cash currently held offshore. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities.

ITEM1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable.
ITEM2. Properties Our headquarters are located on an owned site in San Jose, California. In addition to this site, we own certain sites in the United States, which include facilities in the surrounding areas of San Jose, California; Boxborough, Massachusetts; Richardson, Texas; Lawrenceville, Georgia; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We also own land for expansion in some of these locations. In addition, we also lease office space in several U.S. locations.
Outside the United States, we have operations primarily in leased sites. Larger sites include Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. We own and lease manufacturing facilities, which include among others, test and assembly operations, in San Jose, California, and a principal manufacturing facility for Scientific-Atlanta, located in Juarez, Mexico. We believe that our existing properties, including both owned and leased sites, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.

For additional information regarding properties by operating segment, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference herein.
ITEM3. Legal Proceedings Beginning on April20, 2001, a number of purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our officers and directors. The lawsuits were consolidated, and the consolidated action is purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased our publicly traded securities during an alleged class period of November10, 1999 through February6, 2001. Plaintiffs allege that defendants have made false and misleading statements, purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws, and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On August18, 2006, we announced an agreement to resolve the litigation. Pursuant to that agreement (which is subject to final documentation and court approval), liability insurers will pay $91.75 million to the plaintiffs in resolution of all claims against us and our officers and directors. If the settlement is approved by the Court, the settlement fund, less fees and expenses, will be distributed to purchasers of our common stock between November10, 1999 and February6, 2001 who timely file valid proofs of claim under procedures to be implemented by the Court. We and the individual defendants continue to deny all allegations in the lawsuit.
On February16, 2005, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, against various of our officers and directors and naming us as a nominal 28 Table of Contents defendant. The lawsuit includes derivative and class claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, constructive trust and violations of the California Corporations Code, is based upon allegations of wrongdoing in connection with option grants and compensation to officers and directors, the timing of option grants, and our share repurchase plan, and seeks unspecified compensation and other damages, rescission of options and other relief.
In addition, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, please see Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others herein.
