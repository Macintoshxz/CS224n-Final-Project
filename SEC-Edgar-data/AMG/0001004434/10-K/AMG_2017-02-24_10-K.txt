Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules 89 i Table of Contents PART I Item1.Business We are a global asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of boutique investment management firms (our "Affiliates"). We pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing business, additional investments in boutique investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships structured to enhance our Affiliates' businesses and growth prospects.
We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. The remaining equity interests are retained by management of the Affiliate and enable Affiliate management to continue to participate in their firm's success. Our investment approach provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique investment management firms, and also addresses the succession and ownership transition issues facing many founders and principal owners. Our partnership approach also ensures that our Affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their business, thereby preserving their firm's entrepreneurial culture and independence. In particular, our structures are designed to:  maintain and enhance Affiliate management equity incentives in their firms;  preserve each Affiliate's distinct culture and investment focus; and  provide Affiliates with the ability to realize the benefits of scale economies in global distribution, operations, compliance and technology.
Although we invest in firms that we anticipate will grow independently and without our assistance, we are committed to helping Affiliates identify opportunities for growth and leverage the benefits of economies of scale. We assist our Affiliates in broadening their global distribution capabilities, developing new products and providing strategic support and enhanced operational capabilities.
We believe that substantial opportunities to make investments in high-quality boutique investment management firms will continue to arise as their founders seek to institutionalize their businesses through broader equity ownership, or approach retirement age and begin to plan for succession. Our management identifies select firms based on our thorough understanding of the asset management industry, and has developed relationships with a significant number of these firms. Within our target universe, we seek the strongest and most stable firms with the best growth prospects. These firms are typically characterized by a strong multi-generational management team and culture, with a commitment to building longer-term success, focused investment discipline and diverse products and distribution channels. We are focused on investing in the highest quality boutique investment management firms, including traditional, alternative and wealth management firms, specializing in an array of investment styles and asset classes. We anticipate that we will have significant additional investment opportunities across the global asset management industry, including the potential for investments in subsidiaries, divisions and other investment teams or products.
Investment Management Operations As of December31, 2012, we manage $431.8billion in assets through our Affiliates across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels: Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth. We believe that our diversification across geographies, asset classes, investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments.
The composition of our assets under management and a summary of selected financial data attributable to our operations for each distribution channel are included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages18 and 22, respectively.
1 Table of Contents Institutional Distribution Channel Through our Affiliates, we manage assets for large institutional investors world-wide including sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments, and retirement plans for corporations and municipalities.
Our institutional investment services and products are distributed by sales and marketing professionals developing new institutional business through direct sales efforts and established relationships with pension consultants around the world. Our global distribution platform operates in key markets to extend the reach of our Affiliates' own business development efforts, including offices in Sydney, serving institutional investors in Australia and New Zealand; London and Zurich, serving institutional investors in the United Kingdom and Europe; Dubai, serving institutional investors in the Middle East; and Hong Kong, serving institutional investors in Asia. Our efforts are designed to ensure that our Affiliates' products and services are successfully tailored and marketed and are responsive to the evolving demands of the global marketplace by providing our Affiliates with resources and expertise to improve their asset gathering capability. Our Affiliates currently manage assets for non-U.S. clients in more than 40 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
Mutual Fund Distribution Channel In our mutual fund distribution channel, we provide advisory or sub-advisory services to mutual funds and other retail-oriented products. These funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries, including independent investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors, broker-dealers, major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments.
Through our global distribution platform, we provide access to the U.S. mutual fund wholesale distribution channel and wrap sponsor platforms, and provide our Affiliates with a single point of contact for retail intermediaries such as banks, brokerage firms and other sponsored platforms.
High Net Worth Distribution Channel Through our Affiliates, we provide advisory services to ultra-high net worth individuals, families and charitable foundations. Direct services to these clients include customized investment counseling, investment management and fiduciary services. In 2011, we formed AMG Wealth Partners to extend and tailor our innovative partnership approach to equity investments in ultra-high net worth wealth management firms.
Additionally, we provide advisory services to high net worth individuals through managed account relationships with intermediaries such as brokerage firms. Through our global distribution platform, we provide our Affiliates with enhanced managed account distribution and administration capabilities to individual managed account clients.
Our Structure and Relationship with Affiliates We establish and maintain long-term partnerships with our Affiliates, believing that Affiliate management equity ownership (along with AMG's ownership) aligns our interests and provides Affiliates with a powerful incentive to continue to grow their business. We partner with the highest quality firms in the industry, with outstanding management teams, strong long-term performance records and a demonstrated commitment to continued growth and success. Our partnership approach ensures that Affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their business, thereby preserving their entrepreneurial culture and independence.
Although the specific structure of each investment is highly tailored to meet the needs of a particular Affiliate, in all cases, we establish a meaningful equity interest in the firm, with the 2 Table of Contents remaining equity interests retained by Affiliate management. Each Affiliate is organized as a separate firm, and its operating or shareholder agreement is structured to provide appropriate incentives for management owners and to address their particular characteristics while also enabling us to protect our interests, including through arrangements such as long-term employment agreements with key members of the firm.
We generally have contractual arrangements ("revenue sharing arrangements") with our Affiliates. In many cases, a percentage of revenue is allocable to fund operating expenses, including compensation (the "Operating Allocation"), while the remaining revenue (the "Owners' Allocation") is allocable to us and Affiliate management, generally with a priority to us. In other revenue sharing arrangements, we own a minority interest that allocates to us a percentage of the Affiliate's revenue, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners. Certain of our Affiliates operate under profit-based arrangements through which we receive a share of profits as cash flow, rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement. As a result, we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms. From time to time, we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an Affiliate in order to better support the firm's growth strategy.
Many of our Affiliate operating agreements provide Affiliate management conditional rights ("put rights") that enable them to sell their retained equity interests to us at certain intervals, gradually over time. These agreements also provide us conditional rights to require the managers to sell their interests to us ("call rights"). We believe these rights enhance our ability to keep our ownership within a desired range and provide Affiliate management sufficient incentives to grow and improve their business and create equity value for themselves. These rights help facilitate our ability to provide equity ownership opportunities in our Affiliates to a broader group of management.
Through our Affiliates, we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services. Investment management fees ("asset-based fees") are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client's assets under management. Our private equity products generally bill advisory fees on committed capital.
Certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period ("in advance"). Other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period ("in arrears"). Most client accounts in the High Net Worth distribution channel are billed in advance, and most client accounts in the Institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears. Clients in the Mutual Fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management. Asset-based fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period but may reflect changes due to client withdrawals. Conversely, asset-based fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period.
In addition, certain Affiliate alternative investment and equity products bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance ("performance fees"). These products, which are primarily in the Institutional distribution channel, are often structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and, if earned, the performance fees are typically billed less frequently than an asset-based fee. Although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue. We also anticipate that, within any calendar year, the majority of performance fees will typically be realized in the fourth quarter.
When we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm, we consolidate the Affiliates' results. In certain instances, we hold a minority investment and generally use the equity method of accounting. Consistent with the equity method of accounting, we have not consolidated the operating results 3 Table of Contents (including the revenue) of these firms and, therefore, increases or decreases in these firms' assets under management will not affect our reported revenue. Our share of these firms' earnings is generally calculated as a percentage of revenue (net of intangible amortization).
Our Net income reflects the revenue of our consolidated Affiliates (but not the revenue of our equity method Affiliates) and our share of income from equity method Affiliates, reduced by:  our expenses, including the operating expenses of our consolidated Affiliates; and  the profits allocated to managers of our consolidated Affiliates (i.e.,non-controlling interest).
As discussed above, for consolidated Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, the operating expenses of the Affiliate as well as its managers' non-controlling interest generally increase (or decrease) as the Affiliate's revenue increases (or decreases) because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the Affiliate's revenue and its Operating Allocation and Owners' Allocation. At our consolidated profit-based Affiliates, expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the Affiliates' revenues.
Our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors, including:  those affecting the global financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly, which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our Affiliates;  the level of Affiliate revenue, which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future Affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures, marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results;  our receipt of Owners' Allocation from Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, which depends on the ability of our existing and future Affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins;  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of Affiliates that operate on a profit-based model;  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments;  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed;  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments;  the level of our expenses, including compensation for our employees; and  the level of taxation to which we are subject.
Investments in Affiliates On June29, 2012, we completed our investment in Veritable,LP ("Veritable") through AMG Wealth Partners. Veritable manages assets for ultra-high net worth individuals and provides comprehensive, objective and tax-sensitive investment consultation through an approach customized for each client's specific needs.
On June29, 2012, we completed our investment in Yacktman Asset ManagementLP ("Yacktman"). Yacktman specializes in large-cap equities through a unique, value-oriented approach.
4 Table of Contents On July31, 2012, we completed an additional investment in our Affiliate, BlueMountain Capital ManagementLLC ("BlueMountain"), a leading global credit alternatives manager. BlueMountain manages assets across a diverse set of strategies in the credit markets.
Our target investment universe includes more than 1,800 investment management firms globally, and we have established relationships with approximately 800 of these firms and continue to develop new relationships with additional firms. With our track record of successful partnership, we are uniquely positioned to execute on a diverse opportunity set, including a broad array of traditional, alternative and wealth management firms. We believe that demographic trends will continue to create a number of succession planning opportunities as the founders of independent firms recognize the need for partnership transition, or otherwise seek a degree of diversification and increase in resources to pursue their growth strategy. In addition, we believe alternative firms will continue to seek institutional partnerships and liquidity, thereby creating a number of opportunities for minority investments. Finally, we expect that the number of transaction opportunities available to us will be further enhanced as larger financial organizations dispose of non-core asset management subsidiaries.
We are well positioned to execute upon these investment opportunities through our established process of identifying and cultivating investment prospects, our broad industry relationships, and our substantial experience and expertise in structuring and negotiating transactions. In addition, we have a strong reputation as an effective partner to our existing Affiliates, and are recognized as an innovative, supportive institutional partner for the highest quality boutique investment management firms.
Competition In each of our three principal distribution channels, we and our Affiliates compete with a large number of other domestic and foreign investment management firms, as well as subsidiaries of larger financial organizations. These firms may have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources, captive distribution and greater assets under management and many offer an even broader array of investment products and services. Since certain Affiliates are active in the same distribution channels, from time to time they compete with each other for clients. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry for new investment management firms to compete with our Affiliates, especially in the Institutional distribution channel. We believe that the most important factors affecting our ability to compete for clients in our three principal distribution channels are the:  performance records, investment style and discipline, and reputation of our Affiliates and their management teams, as well as their ability to attract and retain high quality investment professionals;  depth and continuity of client relationships;  diversity of products offered;  level of client service offered;  the continued success of our global distribution platform and the strong business relationships with the major intermediaries who currently distribute our products; and  development and marketing of new investment strategies and ability to access opportunities to meet the changing needs of investors.
The relative importance of each of these factors can vary depending on the distribution channel and the type of investment management service involved, as well as general market conditions. Each Affiliate's ability to retain and increase assets under management would be adversely affected if client accounts underperform in comparison to relevant benchmarks or peer groups, or if key personnel leave the Affiliate. The ability of each Affiliate to compete with other investment management firms also 5 Table of Contents depends, in part, on the relative attractiveness of its investment philosophies and methods under then-prevailing market trends.
A component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of equity interests in additional high-quality boutique investment management firms. We compete with a number of acquirers of investment management firms, including other investment management companies, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and larger financial organizations. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial and strategic resources than we do, which may make our competitors more attractive to the owners of the firms in which we are considering an investment. In addition, these competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. We believe that important factors affecting our ability to compete for future investments are the:  degree to which target firms view our investment structure as preferable, financially, operationally or otherwise, to acquisition or investment arrangements offered by other potential purchasers; and  reputation and performance of our existing and future Affiliates, by which target firms may judge us and our future prospects.
Government Regulation Our business is subject to complex and extensive regulation by various regulatory authorities in jurisdictions around the world. This regulatory environment may be altered without notice by new laws or regulations, revisions to existing regulations or new interpretations or guidance. Changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, our profitability and mode of operations, and could require that we or our Affiliates incur substantial cost or curtail our operations or investment offerings. Regulatory authorities may also conduct examinations or inspections of our operations or those of our Affiliates and any determination of a failure to comply with laws or regulations could result in disciplinary or enforcement action with penalties that may include the disgorgement of fees, fines, suspensions or censure of individual employees or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration. Even in the absence of wrongdoing, regulatory inquiries or proceedings could cause substantial expenditures of time and capital and result in reputational damage, and potentially have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Global financial regulatory reform initiatives are likely to result in more stringent regulation of the financial services industry in which we and our Affiliates operate, which could adversely affect our business.
Employees and Corporate Organization As of December31, 2012, we had approximately 130 employees and our Affiliates had approximately 2,100 employees, the substantial majority of which were full-time. Neither we nor any of our Affiliates is subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that our labor relations are good. We were formed in 1993 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware.

6 Table of Contents Item1A.Risk Factors We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our business, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some of the more important factors that could affect our business.
Our financial results depend on equity market returns and the investment performance of our Affiliates.
Our Affiliates typically receive fees based on the market value of assets under management, and payments will be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets. In addition, some of our Affiliates are paid fees based on investment performance on an absolute basis or relative to a specified benchmark and, as such, are directly dependent upon investment results which may vary substantially from year to year. Unfavorable market performance and volatility in the capital markets or in the prices of specific securities may reduce our Affiliates' assets under management, which in turn may adversely affect the fees payable to our Affiliates and, ultimately, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Because our assets under management are largely concentrated in equity products, our results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets, or a decline in the assets invested in the equity markets.
Our growth strategy depends upon continued growth from our existing Affiliates and upon making new investments in boutique investment management firms.
Our Affiliates may not maintain their respective levels of performance or contribute to our growth at their historical or currently anticipated levels. Also, our Affiliates may be unable to carry out their management succession plans, which may adversely affect their operations and revenue streams and thus our results of operations.
The success of our investment program will depend upon our ability to find suitable firms in which to invest, our ability to negotiate agreements with such firms on acceptable terms, and our ability to raise the capital necessary to finance such transactions. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in finding or investing in such firms or that they will have favorable operating results following our investment, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our financial results could be adversely affected by the financial stability of other financial institutions.
We and our Affiliates routinely execute transactions with various counterparties in the financial services industry. Historical market volatility highlights the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrates how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially and adversely impact the performance of other institutions. We and our Affiliates may be exposed to such risk in the event that a counterparty with whom we transact defaults on its obligations, or if there are other unrelated systemic failures in the markets.
Historically, equity markets and our common stock have been volatile.
The market price of our common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience volatility, and the broader equity markets have experienced and may again experience significant price and volume fluctuations. In addition, our announcements of our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us, our Affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.
7 Table of Contents Our business is highly regulated.
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities in jurisdictions around the world. If we or any of our Affiliates were to fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or be named as a subject of an investigation or other regulatory action, the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any such investigation or action could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and result in increased costs even if we (or our Affiliates) were found not to have violated such laws, rules or regulations. The failure of AMG or any Affiliate to satisfy regulatory requirements could subject it to civil liability, criminal liability or sanctions that might materially impact our business and the Affiliate's business. As investment advisers, our Affiliates are subject to numerous obligations, fiduciary duties and other regulatory requirements, where non-compliance could result in censure or termination of adviser status, litigation or reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations. We are at times subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. Proposals in the U.S. and the European Union have called for more stringent regulation and additional taxation of the financial services industry in which we and our Affiliates operate, which may make it more likely that changes will occur that could adversely affect our business, our access to capital and the market for our common stock.
Changes in laws or regulatory requirements, or the interpretation or application of such laws and regulatory requirements by regulatory authorities, can occur without notice and could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and mode of operations. In the U.S., regulatory uncertainty continues to surround the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment and requires federal agencies to implement numerous new rules, which may impose additional restrictions and limitations on our business as they are adopted. In the United Kingdom and Europe, our business may be impacted by financial services reform initiatives enacted or under consideration in the European Union. Compliance with these new laws and regulations may also result in increased compliance costs and expenses.
Our international operations are subject to foreign risks, including political, regulatory, economic and currency risks.
We and some of our Affiliates operate offices or advise clients outside of the U.S., and several Affiliates are based outside the U.S. Accordingly, we and our Affiliates that have foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, in addition to the risks our business faces more generally. These risks may include changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles, difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable, different, and in some cases, less stringent legal, regulatory and accounting regimes, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls, expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences. These or other risks related to our international operations may have an adverse effect both on our Affiliates and on our consolidated business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our Affiliates' autonomy limits our ability to alter their management practices and policies, and we may be held responsible for liabilities incurred by them.
Although our agreements with our Affiliates typically give us the authority to control and/or vote with respect to certain of their business activities, we generally are not directly involved in managing our Affiliates' day-to-day activities, including investment management policies and procedures, fee levels, marketing and product development, client relationships, employment and compensation programs and compliance activities. As a consequence, our financial condition and results of operations 8 Table of Contents may be adversely affected by problems stemming from the day-to-day operations of our Affiliates, where weaknesses or failures in internal processes or systems could lead to a disruption of our Affiliates' operations, liability to their clients, exposure to disciplinary action or reputational harm.
Some of our Affiliates are partnerships or limited liability companies of which we, or entities controlled by us, are the general partner or managing member. Consequently, to the extent that any of these Affiliates incur liabilities or expenses that exceed its ability to pay for them, we may be directly or indirectly liable for their payment. In addition, with respect to each of our Affiliates, we may be held liable in some circumstances as a control person for the acts of the Affiliate or its employees. While we and our Affiliates maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance in amounts believed to be adequate to cover certain potential liabilities, we cannot be certain that we will not have claims that exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that the insurers will remain solvent and will meet their obligations to provide coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us and our Affiliates with sufficient limits and at a reasonable cost. A judgment in excess of available insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
We depend on regular distributions from our Affiliates to fund our operations. In addition, our structure results in substantial structural subordination that may affect our ability to make payments on our obligations.
We receive cash distributions from our Affiliates. An Affiliate's payment of distributions to us may be subject to claims by the Affiliate's creditors and to limitations applicable to the Affiliate under federal and state laws, including securities and bankruptcy laws, and any applicable non-U.S. laws. Additionally, an Affiliate may default on some or all of the distributions that are payable to us. If we do not receive the distributions to which we are entitled under our agreements with our Affiliates, it would adversely affect us, and may affect our ability to make payments on our obligations.
Our right to receive any assets of our Affiliates or subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and thus the right of the holders of our securities to benefit from those assets, typically would be subordinated to the claims of that entity's creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our Affiliates or subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest and indebtedness that is senior to us.
The agreed-upon expense allocation under our revenue sharing arrangements with our Affiliates may not be large enough to pay for all of the respective Affiliate's operating expenses.
Our Affiliates have generally entered into agreements with us under which they have agreed to pay us a specified percentage of their respective gross revenue, while retaining a percentage of revenue for use in paying that Affiliate's operating expenses. We may not anticipate and reflect in those agreements possible changes in the revenue and expense base of any Affiliate, and the agreed-upon expense allocation may not be large enough to pay for all of an Affiliate's operating expenses. We may elect to defer the receipt of our share of an Affiliate's revenue to permit the Affiliate to fund such operating expenses, or we may restructure our relationship with an Affiliate with the aim of maximizing the long-term benefits to us, but we cannot be certain that any such deferral or restructured relationship would be of any greater benefit to us. Such a deferral or restructured relationship may have an adverse effect on our near-term or long-term profitability and financial condition.
The sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact the price of our common stock.
The sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely impact its price. In connection with our financing activities, we issued securities and entered into contracts including our convertible securities and forward equity agreements that may result in the 9 Table of Contents issuance of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. As of December31, 2012, approximately 7.8million shares remain issuable under the terms of our convertible securities. Moreover, in connection with future financing activities, we may issue additional convertible securities or shares of our common stock. Any such issuance of shares of our common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current equity holders. In the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market, the price of our common stock may fall.
The failure to consummate announced investments in new investment management firms could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Consummation of our acquisition transactions is generally subject to a number of closing conditions, contingencies and approvals, including but not limited to obtaining certain consents of the investment management firms' clients. In the event that an announced transaction is not consummated, we may experience a decline in the price of our common stock to the extent that the then-current market price reflects a market assumption that we will complete the announced transaction. In addition, the fact that a transaction did not close after we announced it publicly may negatively affect our ability and prospects to consummate transactions in the future. Finally, we must pay costs related to these transactions, including legal and accounting fees, even if the transactions are not completed, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future, and existing or future resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.
While we believe that our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for normal operations for the foreseeable future, our continuing acquisitions of interests in new affiliated investment management firms may require additional capital. We may also need to repurchase some or all of our $460.0million of outstanding 3.95% convertible senior notes in the third quarter of 2013. We are contingently liable to make additional purchase payments upon the achievement of specified financial targets in connection with certain of our prior acquisitions and we have obligations to purchase additional equity in existing Affiliates, which obligations may be triggered from time to time. These obligations may require more cash than is then available from operations. Thus, we may need to raise capital by making additional borrowings or by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities, or to otherwise refinance a portion of these obligations.
Our level of indebtedness may increase if we fund one or more future acquisitions through borrowings under our credit facility. This additional indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and will require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness.
The financing activities described above could increase our interest expense, decrease our Net income and dilute the interests of our existing stockholders. In addition, our access to further capital, and the cost of capital we are able to access, is influenced by our credit rating. A reduction in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and may limit our access to the capital markets.
We have substantial intangibles on our balance sheet, and any impairment of our intangibles could adversely affect our results of operations.
At December31, 2012, our total assets were approximately $6.2billion, of which approximately $3.9billion were intangible assets, and approximately $1.0billion were Equity investments in Affiliates, an amount comprised primarily of intangible assets. We cannot be certain that we will ever realize the 10 Table of Contents value of such intangible assets. An impairment of our intangible assets or an other than temporary decline in the value of our equity investments could adversely affect our results of operations.
We and our Affiliates rely on certain key personnel and cannot guarantee their continued service.
We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and our other officers and employees. Our executive officers, in particular, play an important role in the stability and growth of our existing Affiliates and in identifying potential investment opportunities for us. We do not have employment agreements with our officers, although each of them has a significant equity interest, including stock options.
In addition, our Affiliates depend heavily on the services of key principals, who in many cases have managed their firms for many years. These principals often are primarily responsible for their firm's investment decisions. Although we use a combination of economic incentives, transfer restrictions and, in some instances, non-solicitation agreements and employment agreements in an effort to retain key management personnel, there is no guarantee that these principals will remain with their firms. Since certain Affiliates contribute significantly to our revenue, the loss of key management personnel at these Affiliates could have a disproportionate adverse impact on our business.
Failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure may limit our growth, result in losses or disrupt our business.
We operate in an industry that is dependent on its information systems and technology. The failure to implement and maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business could impede our productivity and growth, which could adversely impact our stock price and results of operations. Further, although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If any such event occurred, this potentially could jeopardize our and our Affiliates' confidential and other information, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs or reputational harm.
Our Affiliates' investment management contracts are subject to termination on short notice.
Our Affiliates derive almost all of their revenue from their clients based upon their investment management contracts with those clients. These contracts are typically terminable by the client without penalty upon relatively short notice (typically not longer than 60days) and may not be assignable without consent. We cannot be certain that our Affiliates will be able to retain their existing clients or attract new clients. If our Affiliates' clients withdraw a substantial amount of funds, it is likely to harm our results. In addition, investment management contracts with mutual funds are subject to annual approval by each fund's board of directors.
Our industry is highly competitive.
Through our Affiliates, we compete with a broad range of investment managers, including public and private investment advisors, firms associated with securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, insurance companies, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and other entities that serve our three principal distribution channels, many of whom have greater resources. This competition may reduce the fees that our Affiliates can obtain for their services. We believe that our Affiliates' ability to compete effectively with other firms in our three distribution channels depends upon our Affiliates' products, investment performance and client-servicing capabilities, and the marketing and distribution of their investment products. Our Affiliates may not compare favorably with their competitors in any or all of these categories. From time to time, our Affiliates also compete with each other for clients.
11 Table of Contents The market for acquisitions of interests in investment management firms is highly competitive. Many other public and private financial services companies, including commercial and investment banks, insurance companies and investment management firms, which may have significantly greater resources than we do, also invest in or buy investment management firms. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with such companies, that new competitors will not enter the market or that such competition will not make it more difficult or not feasible for us to make new investments in investment management firms.
12 Table of Contents Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments There are no unresolved written comments that were received from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff 180days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Item2.Properties Our headquarters and principal offices are located at 600 Hale Street, Prides Crossing, Massachusetts 01965; we believe that the property is suitable for the foreseeable future. We also lease offices in West Palm Beach, Florida; Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; Norwalk, Connecticut; Chicago, Illinois; Sydney, Australia; London, England; Zurich, Switzerland; Hong Kong and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In addition, each of our Affiliates leases office space in the city or cities in which it conducts business.
Item3.Legal Proceedings From time to time, we and our Affiliates may be parties to various claims, suits and complaints. Currently, there are no such claims, suits or complaints that, in our opinion, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
Item4.Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.
13 Table of Contents PART II Item5.Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: AMG). The following table sets forth the high and low prices as reported on the New York Stock Exchange since January1, 2011 for the periods indicated.
High Low 2011 First quarter $ 112.86 $ 96.90 Second quarter 113.00 93.38 Third quarter 109.67 75.71 Fourth quarter 100.41 70.27 2012 First quarter $ 114.39 $ 95.95 Second quarter 115.66 94.32 Third quarter 127.88 102.21 Fourth quarter 132.33 119.84 The closing price for a share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on February15, 2013 was $146.51. As of February15, 2013, there were 22 stockholders of record.
We have not declared a cash dividend with respect to the periods presented. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock as we intend to retain earnings to finance investments in new Affiliates, repay indebtedness, pay interest and income taxes, repurchase debt securities and shares of our common stock when appropriate, and develop our existing business. Furthermore, our credit facility contains limitations on cash dividends.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In February 2007, July 2010 and October 2011, the Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to 3.0million, 0.5million and 2.0million shares, respectively, of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter ended December31, 2012. As of such date, approximately 2.3million shares remain available for repurchase under these programs, which do not expire. Purchases may be made from time to time, at management's discretion.
14 Table of Contents The following graph compares the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock from November21, 1997, the date of our initial public offering, through December31, 2012, with the cumulative total return, during the same period, on the Standard& Poor's 500 Index, the Standard& Poor's 500 Financial Sector Index and a peer group comprised of AllianceBernstein HoldingL.P., Ameriprise Financial,Inc., BlackRock,Inc., Eaton Vance Corp., Federated Investors,Inc., Franklin Resources,Inc., InvescoLtd., Janus Capital GroupInc., Legg Mason,Inc., T. Rowe Price Group,Inc. and Waddell& Reed Financial,Inc. ("Peer Group"). The comparison assumes the investment of $100 on November21, 1997 in our common stock and each of the comparison indices and, in each case, assumes reinvestment of all dividends.

(2) Economic net income, including a reconciliation to Net income (controlling interest), and Economic earnings per share are discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on page26.
In the first quarter of 2010, we modified our Economic net income definition to exclude the effect of imputed interest related to contingent payment arrangements from Net income (controlling interest), and in the fourth quarter of 2010 we further modified the definition to no longer add back Affiliate depreciation to Net income (controlling interest). If we had applied these definition changes to all periods presented above, Economic net income would have been $218.3million, $170.4million and $292.3million and Economic earnings per share would have been $5.40, $4.01 and $5.95 for the years ended December31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
16 Table of Contents Item7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements When used in this Annual Report on Form10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "may," "intends," "believes," "estimate," "project" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the following:  our performance is directly affected by changing conditions in global financial markets generally and in the equity markets particularly, and a decline or a lack of sustained growth in these markets may result in decreased advisory fees or performance fees and a corresponding decline (or lack of growth) in our operating results and in the cash flow distributable to us from our Affiliates;  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in finding or investing in additional investment management firms on favorable terms, that we will be able to consummate announced investments in new investment management firms, or that existing and new Affiliates will have favorable operating results;  we may need to raise capital by making long-term or short-term borrowings or by selling shares of our common stock or other securities in order to finance investments in additional investment management firms or additional investments in our existing Affiliates, and we cannot be sure that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all; and  those certain other factors discussed under the caption "Risk Factors." These factors could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. We will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.
Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition. This overview and the remainder of this Management's Discussion and Analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of AMG and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "AMG") and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K.
For the year ended December31, 2012, Net income (controlling interest) was $174.0million, Earnings per sharediluted was $3.28, including a $102.2million impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of our Affiliates, and Cash flow from operations was $633.2million. For the year ended December31, 2011, Net income (controlling interest) was $164.9million, Earnings per sharediluted was $3.11 and Cash flow from operations was $708.5million.
For the year ended December31, 2012, Economic net income was $408.8million, Economic earnings per share was $7.71, representing a 16% increase over the prior year, and EBITDA was $543.4million.

Reconciliations of Net income to Economic net income and Cash flow from operations to EBITDA are included on pages27 and 29, respectively.
17 Table of Contents For the year ended December31, 2012 our assets under management increased 32% to $431.8billion. The increase was the result of $47.5billion from investment performance, $30.1billion from organic growth from net client cash flows and $28.0billion from our new investments in Veritable and Yacktman.

18 Table of Contents (5) The Geography of a particular investment product describes the general location of its investment holdings.
During the year ended December31, 2012, on an asset class basis, we experienced organic growth from net client cash flows in our Alternative ($18.8billion) and Equity asset classes ($8.5billion). On a geographic basis, our Global products benefited from net client cash flows of $23.8billion and the Domestic and Emerging Markets products benefited from net client cash flows of $3.5billion and $2.9billion, respectively. Strong investment performance across all geographic areas and in the Alternative and Equity asset classes also contributed to growth in 2012.
During the year ended December31, 2011, we experienced strong organic growth from net client cash flows in our Alternative ($12.8billion) and Equity asset classes ($7.9billion). Our Global products benefited from net client cash flows of $14.7billion and the Emerging Markets products benefited from net client cash flows of $6.7billion, partially offset by negative investment performance across all geographic regions.
Assets under Management by Operating Segment The following tables present a rollforward of our assets under management by operating segment (which are also referred to as distribution channels in this Annual Report on Form10-K).
19 Table of Contents Statement of Changes (in billions) Institutional Mutual Fund High Net Worth Total December31, 2009 $ 133.9 $ 44.5 $ 29.6 $ 208.0 Client cash inflows 29.8 21.4 7.6 58.8 Client cash outflows (24.2 ) (18.5 ) (6.7 ) (49.4 ) Net client cash flows 5.6 2.9 0.9 9.4 New investments 37.6 26.5 0.4 64.5 Investment performance 25.4 9.7 4.2 39.3 Other (1) (2.4 ) 1.6 (0.4 ) (1.2 ) December31, 2010 $ 200.1 $ 85.2 $ 34.7 $ 320.0 Client cash inflows 44.5 29.2 7.6 81.3 Client cash outflows (28.0 ) (23.8 ) (6.6 ) (58.4 ) Net client cash flows 16.5 5.4 1.0 22.9 Investment performance (10.9 ) (5.2 ) 0.9 (15.2 ) Other (1)  (0.2 )  (0.2 ) December31, 2011 $ 205.7 $ 85.2 $ 36.6 $ 327.5 Client cash inflows 43.5 35.0 11.0 89.5 Client cash outflows (24.9 ) (25.3 ) (9.2 ) (59.4 ) Net client cash flows 18.6 9.7 1.8 30.1 New investments  14.8 13.2 28.0 Investment performance 30.8 12.3 4.4 47.5 Other (1) (0.8 ) (0.1 ) (0.4 ) (1.3 ) December31, 2012 $ 254.3 $ 121.9 $ 55.6 $ 431.8 (1) Other includes assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions, new investment client transitions and transfers of our interests in certain Affiliated investment management firms, the financial effects of which are not significant to our ongoing results.
As shown in the assets under management table above, client cash inflows totaled $89.5billion while client cash outflows totaled $59.4billion for the year ended December31, 2012. The net flows for the year ended December31, 2012 occurred across a broad range of product offerings in each of our distribution channels, with no individual cash inflow or outflow having a significant impact on our revenue or expenses.
The operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management. For the Mutual Fund distribution channel, average assets under management represent an average of the daily net assets under management. For the Institutional and High Net Worth distribution channels, average assets under management reflect the billing patterns of particular client accounts. For example, assets under management for an account that bills in advance is presented in the table on the basis of beginning of period assets under management while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end of period assets under management. Assets under management attributable to any investment in new Affiliates are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment. We believe that this analysis more closely correlates 20 Table of Contents to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and, as such, provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue.

(2) In 2011 and 2012, we adjusted our estimate of contingent payment obligations. In 2011, we recorded a gain of $4.8million ($3.1million of which was attributable to the controlling interest), of which $4.6million and $0.2million was allocated to our Institutional and Mutual Fund channels, respectively. In 2012, we recognized a gain totaling $53.8million ($35.8million of which was attributable to the controlling interest), of which $20.9million, $32.5million and $0.4million was allocated to our Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth channels, respectively.
(3) During 2011 and 2012, we recognized impairments on an indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of our Affiliates of $9.2million and $102.2million, respectively.
(4) During 2011, we determined that the value of a cost method investment had been reduced to zero, and recorded an expense of $12.8million.
21 Table of Contents (5) EBITDA, including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations, is discussed in greater detail in "Supplemental Liquidity Measure" on page28.
Results of Operations Our Affiliate investments are generally structured as revenue sharing arrangements. When we own a controlling interest, we consolidate the Affiliates' results. Our discussion of revenue and operating expenses relates to our consolidated Affiliates.
When we hold a minority investment and are required to use the equity method of accounting, we do not consolidate the operating results of these firms (including their revenue). Our share of these firms' earnings (net of intangible amortization) is reported in Income from equity method investments and is discussed on page24.
Revenue Our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management and the composition of our assets across our operating segments and products within our operating segments, which realize different fee rates. Our ratio of revenue to average assets under management (in total and by channel) is calculated as revenue divided by average assets under management and may change as a result of new investments, net client cash flows, performance and, to a lesser extent, changes in contractual fees. Therefore, changes in this ratio should not necessarily be viewed as an indicator of changes in contractual fee rates billed to our Affiliates' clients.
Our revenue is also determined by the level of performance fees recognized. Performance fees are generally measured on absolute or relative investment performance against a benchmark. As a result, the level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in assets under management.
Our revenue increased $100.7million (or 6%) in 2012 from 2011, primarily from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates, partially offset by a decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance, net client cash flows and our new Affiliate investments in 2012. The decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management, including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fee rates.
Our revenue increased $346.6million (or 26%) in 2011 from 2010, primarily from a 31% increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates, partially offset by a decline in performance fees from our consolidated Affiliates. This increase in average assets under management resulted from the full year impact of our 2010 investments in new Affiliates and net client cash flows, partially offset by a decline in global equity markets during 2011. Unrelated to the change in assets under management, consolidated performance fees declined $27.5million to $30.9million (or 47%) in 2011, as compared to 2010.
Neither changes in the composition of our assets under management between operating segments nor changes to our contractual fee rates had a significant impact on our results.
The following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments.
Institutional Distribution Channel The increase in revenue of $19.9million (or 2%) in the Institutional distribution channel in 2012 from 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in average assets under management, partially offset by a 22 Table of Contents decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance and net client cash flows. The decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management within the channel, including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fee rates.
The increase in revenue of $192.2million (or 30%) in the Institutional distribution channel in 2011 from 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates, partially offset by a decline in performance fees from our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from the full year impact of our 2010 investments in new Affiliates and net client cash flows, partially offset by a decline in global equity markets during 2011. Unrelated to the change in assets under management, consolidated performance fee revenue decreased $25.9million for the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010.
Mutual Fund Distribution Channel The increase in revenue of $50.7million (or 7%) in the Mutual Fund distribution channel in 2012 from 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates, partially offset by a decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance and our new Affiliate investments. The decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management resulted from changes in the composition of our assets under management within the channel, including decreases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively higher fee rates and increases in assets under management in certain products that realize comparatively lower fee rates.
The increase in revenue of $144.9million (or 25%) in the Mutual Fund distribution channel in 2011 from 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from the full year impact of our 2010 investments in new Affiliates and net client cash flows, partially offset by a decline in global equity markets during 2011.
High Net Worth Distribution Channel The increase in revenue of $30.1million (or 22%) in the High Net Worth distribution channel in 2012 from 2011 resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates offset by a decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from our new Affiliate investments and investment performance. The decline in our ratio of revenue to average assets under management was primarily the result of our new Affiliate investments which realize lower fee rates.
The increase in revenue of $9.5million (or 7%) in the High Net Worth distribution channel in 2011 from 2010 resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management from our consolidated Affiliates. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from 2010 investment performance and net client cash flows in both 2010 and 2011.
23 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: (in millions) 2010 2011 % Change 2012 % Change Compensation and related expenses $ 594.5 $ 718.8 21 % $ 784.7 9 % Selling, general and administrative 284.6 350.8 23 % 366.9 5 % Intangible amortization and impairments 60.0 97.7 63 % 200.0 105 % Depreciation and other amortization 14.1 15.0 6 % 14.1 (6 )% Other operating expenses 31.0 36.4 17 % 39.4 8 % Total operating expenses $ 984.2 $ 1,218.7 24 % $ 1,405.1 15 % A substantial portion of our operating expenses was incurred by our Affiliates, the majority of which was incurred by Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements. For Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, an Affiliate's Operating Allocation percentage generally determined its operating expenses. Accordingly, our compensation expense was generally impacted by increases or decreases in each Affiliate's revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective Operating Allocation. The percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varied from one Affiliate to another and may vary within an Affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue. As a result, changes in our aggregate revenue did not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree.
Compensation and related expenses increased $65.9million (or 9%) in 2012 and $124.3million (or 21%) in 2011. The increase in 2012 of $65.9million was primarily the result of increases in aggregate Affiliate expenses attributable to new Affiliate investments in 2012. The increase was also the result of a $15.6million increase primarily in long-term incentive compensation. The increase in 2011 of $124.3million was primarily a result of increases in aggregate Affiliate expenses from the full year impact of new Affiliate investments in 2010. The increases in 2012 and 2011 were also a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at extant Affiliates which experienced increases in revenue, and accordingly, reported higher compensation expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.1million (or 5%) in 2012. This increase was primarily a result of increases in Affiliate expenses from new Affiliate investments in 2012 of $10.3million. This increase was also attributable to an increase in acquisition-related professional fees, as compared to 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $66.2million (or 23%) in 2011. This increase was primarily a result of increases of $48.9million in aggregate Affiliate expenses from the full year impact of new Affiliate investments in 2010. This increase was also attributable to increases in sub-advisory and distribution expenses attributable to increases in assets under management at our Affiliates in the Mutual Fund distribution channel. These increases were partially offset by a $13.5million decrease in acquisition-related professional fees, as compared to 2010.
Intangible amortization and impairments increased $102.3million (or 105%) in 2012 and $37.7million (or 63%) in 2011. These increases were primarily the result of impairments associated with an indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of our Affiliates of $102.2million in 2012 and $9.2million in 2011. The increase in 2011 was also attributable to the full year impact of amortization of definite-lived intangible assets resulting from new Affiliate investments in 2010.
Income from Equity Method Investments When we own a minority investment and are required to use the equity method of accounting, we only recognize our share of these Affiliates' earnings (generally calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue) net of intangible amortization. Accordingly, we have not consolidated these Affiliates' 24 Table of Contents operating results (including their revenue). The following table summarizes our share of the profits from our equity method investments: (in millions) 2010 2011 % Change 2012 % Change Income from equity method investments $ 77.5 $ 72.7 (6 )% $ 129.7 78 % Income from equity method Affiliates increased $57.0million (or 78%) in 2012. This increase was the result of increases in revenue, including performance fees, as well as our additional investment in BlueMountain during 2012. Income from equity method Affiliates decreased $4.8million (or 6%) in 2011. This decrease was primarily the result of decreases in performance fees.
Other Income Statement Data The following table summarizes non-operating income and expense data: (in millions) 2010 2011 % Change 2012 % Change Investment and other income (loss) $ 18.4 $ (5.0 ) n.m.
(1) $ 22.0 n.m.

(1) Income taxes 91.5 93.1 2 % 83.8 (10 )% (1) Percentage change is not meaningful.
Investment and other income increased $27.0million in 2012, as compared to 2011, principally as a result of increases in Affiliate investment earnings. This increase was also a result of a $12.8million write-off of a cost method investment in 2011, which did not recur in 2012. Investment and other income decreased $23.4million in 2011, as compared to 2010, principally as a result of increases in Affiliate investment losses. This decrease also resulted from the write-off of the cost method investment noted previously.
Interest expense increased $9.2million (or 12%) in 2012, primarily as a result of the issuance of the 6.375% Senior Notes due in 2042 (the "2042 senior notes") and the 5.25% Senior Notes due in 2022 (the "2022 senior notes") as well as increased borrowings under our credit facility. Interest expense increased $7.6million (or 11%) in 2011, principally as a result of an increase in the cost of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. This increase was also attributable to a $0.8million increase in issuance costs related to the credit facility amendment that occurred in 2011.
Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements consists of interest accretion on our senior convertible securities and our junior convertible trust preferred securities, as well as the accretion and revaluation of our contingent payment arrangements. Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements decreased $53.4million in 2012 as compared to 2011. This decrease relates primarily to gains on the revaluation of contingent payment arrangements of $53.8million which occurred in 2012. Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements increased $2.4million (or 10%) in 2011 as compared to 2010, principally as a result of a $6.7million increase in accretion related to our contingent payment arrangements (related to investments in new Affiliates) partially offset by a $4.8million gain on revaluation.
Income taxes decreased $9.3million (or 10%) in 2012 from an $11.5million reduction in our valuation allowance, principally on benefits of uncertain tax positions from an improved projection of U.S. income. This benefit was offset by a $3.3million increase in taxes attributable to the non-controlling interest. Income taxes increased $1.6million (or 2%) in 2011, as the result of an increase in Income before income taxes, partially offset by a $7.6million benefit from revaluing certain deferred tax liabilities as a result of a change to corporate tax rates in the United Kingdom.
25 Table of Contents Net Income The following table summarizes Net income for the past three years: (in millions) 2010 2011 % Change 2012 % Change Net income $ 287.3 $ 359.6 25 % $ 411.4 14 % Net income (non-controlling interests) 148.7 194.7 31 % 237.4 22 % Net income (controlling interest) 138.6 164.9 19 % 174.0 6 % Net income (non-controlling interests) increased $42.7million (or 22%) in 2012. This increase was principally a result of our new Affiliate investments in 2012 and increases in Affiliate investment earnings, as well as gains on the revaluation of contingent payment arrangements attributable to the non-controlling interests of $18.0million. Net income (non-controlling interests) increased $46.0million (or 31%) in 2011. This change resulted principally from the previously discussed changes in revenue for the 2011 period as well as Affiliate equity issuances which had the effect of increasing Affiliate equity ownership, and therefore increasing net income attributable to non-controlling interests. These increases were partially offset by increases in amortization, interest expenses, tax expenses and investment losses attributable to non-controlling interests, as compared to 2010.
Net income (controlling interest) increased $9.1million (or 6%) and $26.3million (or 19%) in 2012 and 2011 primarily as a result of the previously discussed increases in revenue for each period, partially offset by increases in operating expenses including the impairment associated with an indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of our Affiliates described above.
Supplemental Performance Measures As supplemental information, we provide non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic net income and Economic earnings per share. We consider Economic net income an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our operating performance before non-cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our investment management firms. Economic net income and Economic earnings per share are used by our management and Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmarks, including as measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. These measures are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) and Earnings per share. Economic net income and Economic earnings per share are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of any liquidity measure calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").
Under our Economic net income definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) amortization (including equity method amortization) and impairments, deferred taxes related to intangible assets, non-cash imputed interest expense (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expense. We add back amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate management partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders.
Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income divided by the adjusted diluted average shares outstanding, which measures the potential share issuance from our senior convertible securities and junior convertible securities (each further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources) using a "treasury stock" method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock 26 Table of Contents equal to the value of these securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion.
The following table provides a reconciliation of Net income (controlling interest) to Economic net income: (in millions, except per share data) 2010 2011 2012 Net income (controlling interest) $ 138.6 $ 164.9 $ 174.0 Intangible amortization and impairments (1) 85.9 117.0 220.9 Intangible-related deferred taxes (2) 47.5 43.2 17.6 Imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements (3) 13.2 14.7 (6.8 ) Affiliate equity expense 7.1 11.2 3.1 Affiliate depreciation 6.8   Economic net income $ 299.1 $ 351.0 $ 408.8 Average shares outstandingdiluted 49.4 53.0 53.0 Assumed issuance of senior convertible securities shares (0.4 )   Assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares    Dilutive impact of senior convertible securities shares 0.1   Dilutive impact of junior convertible securities shares    Average shares outstandingadjusted diluted 49.1 53.0 53.0 Economic earnings per share $ 6.09 $ 6.62 $ 7.71 (1) For our equity method Affiliates, we do not separately report Affiliate revenue or expenses (including intangible amortization) in our income statement. Our share of these investments' amortization is reported in Income from equity method investments. Our reported intangible amortization includes amortization attributable to our non-controlling interests, amounts not added back to Net income (controlling interest) to measure our Economic net income. Reported intangible amortization includes a $9.2million and $102.2million expense in 2011 and 2012, respectively, associated with the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of our Affiliates.
The following table summarizes the intangible amortization and impairments shown above: (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 Reported Intangible amortization and impairments $ 60.0 $ 97.7 $ 200.0 Equity method amortization 32.1 32.9 36.9 Intangible amortizationnon-controlling interests (6.2 ) (13.6 ) (16.0 ) Total $ 85.9 $ 117.0 $ 220.9 (2) As described in Note(1) above, we recognized impairments of certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2011 and 2012. In addition, we recorded a 2.0% reduction in the United Kingdom tax rate. Together, the tax effect of these items resulted in an $8.7 and $43.7million decrease in our intangible-related deferred taxes for 2011 and 2012, respectively.
(3) Our reported Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements, $24.9million, $27.3million and $(26.1) million for 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, includes $3.9million, 27 Table of Contents $4.3million and $(14.1) million of imputed interest attributable to our non-controlling interests, amounts not added back to Net income (controlling interest) to measure our Economic net income.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources: December31, (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 313.3 $ 449.5 $ 430.4 Senior bank debt 460.0 250.0 325.0 Senior notes   340.0 Senior convertible securities 422.1 435.6 450.1 Junior convertible trust preferred securities 509.9 512.6 515.5 Cash Flow Data Operating cash flow 480.7 708.5 633.2 Investing cash flow (973.8 ) (67.7 ) (802.3 ) Financing cash flow 545.0 (503.8 ) 146.2 EBITDA (1) 404.4 471.3 543.4 (1) The definition of EBITDA is presented below under "Supplemental Liquidity Measure." We view our ratio of debt to EBITDA (our "internal leverage ratio") as an important gauge of our ability to service debt, make new investments and access additional capital. Consistent with industry practice, we do not consider junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our internal leverage ratio. We also view our leverage on a "net debt" basis by deducting from our debt balance holding company cash. At December31, 2012, our internal leverage ratio was 1.7:1.
Under the terms of our credit facility we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants. The first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA (the "bank leverage ratio") of 3.0. The calculation of our bank leverage ratio is generally consistent with our internal leverage ratio approach. The second covenant is a minimum EBITDA to cash interest expense ratio of 3.0 (our "bank interest coverage ratio"). For purposes of calculating these ratios, share-based compensation expense is added back to EBITDA. As of December31, 2012, our actual bank leverage and bank interest coverage ratios were 1.9 and 8.2, respectively, and we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facility. We have $750.0million of remaining capacity under our credit facility, and could borrow substantially all such capacity and remain in compliance with our credit facility.
We are rated BBB- by both Standard& Poor's and Fitch rating agencies. With the exception of a modest increase in the borrowing rate under our credit facility (0.50%), a downgrade of our credit rating would have no direct financial effect on any of our agreements or securities (or otherwise trigger a default).
Supplemental Liquidity Measure As supplemental information, we have provided information regarding EBITDA, a non-GAAP liquidity measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, cash flow from operating activities. EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA, as calculated by us, may not be consistent with computations of EBITDA 28 Table of Contents by other companies. As a measure of liquidity, we believe that EBITDA is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt, make new investments and meet working capital requirements. We further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to EBITDA: (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 Cash flow from operating activities $ 480.7 $ 708.5 $ 633.2 Interest expense, net of non-cash items (1) 58.5 65.7 74.8 Current tax provision 42.1 45.0 61.0 Income from equity method investments, net of distributions (2) 43.9 (22.7 ) 61.9 Net income (non-controlling interests) (148.7 ) (194.7 ) (237.4 ) Changes in assets and liabilities (16.0 ) (35.2 ) 45.9 Other non-cash adjustments (3) (56.1 ) (95.3 ) (96.0 ) EBITDA $ 404.4 $ 471.3 $ 543.4 (1) Non-cash items include Amortization of issuance costs and Imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements ($32.5million, $35.4million and $(17.9) million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively).
(2) Distributions from equity method investments were $65.8million, $128.3million and $104.7million for 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
(3) Other non-cash adjustments include share-based compensation expenses, tax benefits from stock options and other adjustments to reconcile Net income (controlling interest) to net cash flow from operating activities.
In the twelve months ended December31, 2012, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities, borrowings under our revolver and the issuance of the senior notes. Our principal uses of cash were to make investments in new and existing Affiliates, make distributions to Affiliate partners and repay our other liabilities. We expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates, settlement of contingent payment arrangements, distributions to Affiliate partners, payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, and for working capital purposes.
The following table summarizes the principal amount at maturity of our debt obligations and convertible securities as of December31, 2012: (in millions) Amount Maturity Date Form of Repayment Senior bank debt $ 325.0 2016 (1) Senior notes 340.0 2022/2042 (2) Senior convertibles securities 460.0 2038 (3) Junior convertible trust preferred securities 730.8 2036/2037 (4) (1) Settled in cash.
(2) Settled in cash on or after October15, 2015 for the 2022 senior notes and August15, 2017 for the 2042 senior notes.
(3) Settled in cash if holders exercise their August 2013, 2018, 2023, 2028 or 2033 put rights, and in cash or common stock at our election if the holders exercise their conversion rights.
29 Table of Contents (4) Settled in cash or common stock (or a combination thereof) at our election if the holders exercise their conversion rights.
Senior Bank Debt We have a $1,075.0million senior unsecured credit facility (the "credit facility"), consisting of an $825.0million revolving credit facility (the "revolver") and a $250.0million term loan (the "term loan"). We pay interest on any outstanding obligations at specified rates (based either on the LIBOR rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time). A portion of the revolver ($30.0million) matures in January 2015 with the balance of $795.0million and the term loan maturing in November 2016. Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the revolver and the term loan by up to $75.0million and $250.0million, respectively.
The credit facility is unsecured and contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, cash dividends, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes.
Senior Notes At December31, 2012, we have two senior notes outstanding. The principal terms of these notes are summarized below.
2022 Senior Notes 2042 Senior Notes Issue date October 2012 August 2012 Maturity date October 2022 August 2042 Potential Call Date October 2015 August 2017 Par value (in millions) $ 140.0 $ 200.0 Call Price At Par At Par Stated coupon 5.25 % 6.375 % Coupon frequency Quarterly Quarterly We used the net proceeds from both the 2022 senior notes and the 2042 senior notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolver.
Convertible Securities At December31, 2012, we have one senior convertible security outstanding ("2008 senior convertible notes") and two junior convertible trust preferred securities outstanding, one issued in 2006 30 Table of Contents (the "2006 junior convertible trust preferred securities") and a second issued in 2007 (the "2007 junior convertible trust preferred securities"). The principal terms of these securities are summarized below.
2008 Senior Convertible Securities 2007Junior Convertible Trust Preferred Securities 2006Junior Convertible Trust Preferred Securities Issue date August 2008 October 2007 April 2006 Maturity date August 2038 October 2037 April 2036 Next potential put date August 2013 N/A N/A Par value (in millions) $ 460.0 $ 430.8 $ 300.0 Carrying value (in millions) (1) 450.1 299.4 216.1 Denomination 1,000 50 50 Current conversion rate 7.959 0.250 0.333 Current conversion price $ 125.65 $ 200.00 $ 150.00 Stated coupon 3.95 % 5.15 % 5.10 % Coupon frequency Semi-annually Quarterly Quarterly Tax deduction rate (2) 9.38 % 8.00 % 7.50 % (1) The carrying value is accreted to the principal amount at maturity over an expected life of five years for the 2008 senior convertible notes and 30years for each of the junior convertible trust preferred securities.
(2) These convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations, which require us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported Interest expense.
The 2008 senior convertible notes are convertible into a defined number of shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion, we may elect to pay or deliver cash, shares of common stock, or some combination thereof. The holders of the 2008 senior convertible notes may put these securities to us in August of 2013, 2018, 2023, 2028 and 2033. We may call the notes for cash at any time on or after August15, 2013. Should either of these events occur, we currently intend to satisfy our obligations with borrowings under our credit facility.
Both the 2006 and 2007 junior convertible trust preferred securities are convertible, at any time, into a defined number of shares. Upon conversion, holders will receive cash or shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. We can call the 2006 junior convertible trust preferred securities if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $195 per share for a specified period of time. We can call the 2007 junior convertible trust preferred securities if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $260 per share for a specified period of time. Holders of the 2006 and 2007 junior convertible trust preferred securities have no rights to put these securities to us.
Derivative Instruments From time to time, we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge.
We have entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange a fixed rate for the variable rate on a portion of our credit facility. These contracts expire between 2015 and 2017. Under these contracts, we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 1.76% on a notional amount of $100.0million through October 2015. Thereafter, through October 2017, we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 2.14% 31 Table of Contents on a remaining notional amount of $25.0million. As of December31, 2012, the unrealized loss (before taxes) on these contracts was $4.0million.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into Standard& Poor's 500 Index puts to limit the effect of a possible market downturn on our 2012 earnings. We recognized an expense of $1.2million for the contracts which had a notional value of $150.0million; these contracts expired on December31, 2012 and no gain was recognized.
Forward Equity Sale Agreement In August 2012, we amended our forward equity agreement to increase the amount of shares of common stock we may sell to an aggregate of $400.0million. During 2012, we entered into contracts to sell a notional amount of $147.2million at an average share price of $121.37. We have the ability to settle the contracts either by delivering shares of common stock and receiving cash or net settling for cash or shares of common stock. All contracts remain outstanding.
Affiliate Equity Many of our operating agreements provide us a conditional right to call and Affiliate partners the conditional right to put their retained equity interests at certain intervals. The purchase price of these conditional purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate's cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions.
Our current redemption value for these interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict, we expect to repurchase approximately $100.0million of Affiliate equity during 2013, and, in such event, will own the cash flow associated with any equity repurchased.
Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations generally represents Net income adjusted for cash distributions from equity method investments, non-cash charges for intangible amortization and impairments, imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements, share-based compensation as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital.
The decrease in cash flows from operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulted principally from decreases in the collections of investment advisory fees receivable ($57.3million), decreases in the settlement of fund shares receivable ($10.4million), as well as an increase in the settlements of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($6.4million).
The increase in cash flows from operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 resulted principally from increases in Net income ($72.3million), distributions received from equity method investments ($62.5million), amortization of intangible assets ($37.7million), and share-based compensation ($10.8million), as well as changes in our working capital, including the collections of Investment advisory fees receivable ($71.7million), partially offset by an increase in the settlements of Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($57.3million).
Investing Cash Flow Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $734.6million in 2012, as compared to 2011. This was primarily the result of our investments in Affiliates during 2012. Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased $906.1million in 2011, as compared to 2010. This was primarily the result 32 Table of Contents of the decrease in new Affiliate investments in 2011. Net cash flows used to make investments in Affiliates were $797.4million, $13.3million and $916.1million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Financing Cash Flow Financing cash flows increased $650.0million in 2012 as compared to 2011. This was primarily a result of the issuance of senior notes ($340.0million in aggregate), a net increase in senior bank debt borrowings and repayments ($285.0million), a reduction in note payments ($68.9million), and an increase in the issuance of common stock ($45.4million). These increases in cash flows were partially offset by an increase in Affiliate equity issuances and repurchases of $94.5million.
Financing cash flows decreased $1,048.8million in 2011 as compared to 2010. This was primarily a result of a decrease in net borrowings of senior bank debt ($670.0million), a decrease in proceeds from the settlement of forward equity sales ($294.7million), an increase in distributions to non-controlling interests ($66.9million), as well as an increase in the repurchase of common stock ($61.0million).
We used available cash and borrowings under our credit facility to finance our investments in Veritable, Yacktman and BlueMountain during 2012, as well as our investments in Artemis and Trilogy during 2010. In 2010, we issued shares of common stock for our Aston investment and we financed our Pantheon investment with available cash, borrowings under our credit facility, and proceeds from the partial settlement of forward equity sales.
Excess tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of $22.0million, $7.1million and $10.1million as of December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Under past acquisition agreements, we are contingently liable, upon achievement of specified financial targets, to make payments of up to $468.2million through 2017. In 2013, we expect to make total payments of approximately $3.2million to settle portions of these contingent arrangements. In addition, we expect to repurchase approximately $100.0million of Affiliate equity during 2013.
Our Board of Directors has periodically authorized share repurchase programs (most recently October 2011). The maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under outstanding programs is approximately 2.3million. The timing and amount of repurchases are determined at the discretion of management. In 2012, we repurchased 0.6million shares for $60.9million at an average price per share of $107.44.
We anticipate that borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from the settlement of any forward equity sales, together with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. As noted previously, we have the right to call and holders have the right to put the 2008 senior convertible notes for cash, which may require us to borrow under our credit facility or issue shares of our common stock.
33 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December31, 2012. Contractual debt obligations include cash payment of fixed interest.
Payments Due (in millions) Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Thereafter Contractual Obligations Senior bank debt $ 325.0 $  $ 78.1 $ 246.9 $  Senior convertible securities (1) 932.4 18.2 36.3 36.3 841.6 Junior convertible trust preferred securities 1,634.3 37.0 74.1 74.1 1,449.1 Senior notes 796.1 20.2 40.2 40.2 695.5 Leases 175.9 26.9 50.4 34.6 64.0 Other liabilities (2) 29.1 11.3   17.8 Derivative instruments 5.9 1.8 3.2 0.9  Total contractual obligations $ 3,898.7 $ 115.4 $ 282.3 $ 433.0 $ 3,068.0 Contingent Obligations Contingent payment obligations (3) $ 200.8 $ 3.2 $ 64.8 $ 132.8 $  (1) Holders of the 2008 senior convertible notes may put interests of up to $460.0million in August 2013.
(2) Other liabilities reflect amounts payable to Affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional Affiliate equity interests. This table does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions or commitments to co-invest in certain investment partnerships (of $22.6million and $75.4million as of December31, 2012, respectively) as we cannot predict when such obligations will be paid.
(3) The amount of contingent payments related to investments in Affiliates disclosed in the table represents our expected settlement amounts. The maximum settlement amount through 2013 is approximately $164.7million and $303.5million in periods thereafter.
Market Risk Our revenue is derived primarily from advisory fees which are based on assets under management. Such values are affected by changes in financial markets, and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our Revenue and Net income. The broader financial markets are also affected by changing interest rates. We cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our Affiliates' assets under management and associated fees.
We have fixed rates of interest on our senior notes, our 2008 senior convertible notes and on both issues of our junior convertible trust preferred securities. We pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facility.
While a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities, such a change may affect the fair value of these securities. We estimate that a 1%change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately $84.7million.
From time to time, we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into derivative contracts as described on page31. We estimate that a 1%increase in interest rates as of December31, 2012 would result in a net increase in the unrealized value of our derivative contracts of approximately $3.3million.
34 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness.
Most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in U.S.dollars. A portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates. In addition, the valuations of our foreign Affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which could be recorded as a component of stockholders' equity. To illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates, as of December31, 2012, a 1%change in the Canadian dollar and British Pound to U.S.dollar exchange rates would result in an approximate $5.2million change to stockholders' equity and a $0.5million change to income before income taxes. During 2012, changes in currency exchange rates increased stockholders' equity by $18.5million.
Recent Accounting Developments In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance. The new guidance clarifies existing fair value measurement principles and expands certain disclosure requirements, particularly for measurements categorized as Level3. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance that provides the option of performing a qualitative assessment before proceeding with a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Following an assessment of qualitative factors, if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is greater than its carrying amount, then a quantitative assessment is unnecessary. This guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We early-adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the guidance for reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The new guidance requires companies to present in a single note or on the face of the financial statements, the impact of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The new guidance is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following are our critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported.
Fair Value Measurements Accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
35 Table of Contents These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
We make judgments to determine the fair value of certain assets, liabilities and equity interests when allocating the purchase price of our new investments, when revaluing our contingent payment arrangements, when we issue or repurchase equity interests and when we test our intangible assets or equity and cost method investments for impairment.
In determining fair values, we make assumptions about the growth rates, profitability and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts, and consider historical and current market multiples, tax benefits, credit risk, interest rates and discount rates. We consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to observed market transactions, and in certain instances consult with third party valuation experts.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized, and is reported within the segments in which the business operates. Our goodwill impairment assessments are performed annually at the reporting unit level (in our case, our three operating segments), or more frequently, should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount. We completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment and no impairments were identified. For purposes of our assessment, we considered various qualitative factors (including market multiples for asset management businesses) and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was greater than its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. Only a substantial decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units would indicate that an impairment may exist.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts between our Affiliates and their sponsored registered investment companies. Because the contracts are with the registered investment companies themselves, and not with the underlying investors, and the contracts between our Affiliates and the registered investment companies are typically renewed on an annual basis, industry practice under GAAP is to consider the contract life to be indefinite and, as a result, not amortizable.
We perform indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests annually, or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount. We assess each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by considering various qualitative factors (including market multiples). During 2012, we determined that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of our Affiliates, a manager of growth-oriented U.S.equity mutual funds, had declined below its carrying value and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment of $102.2million. The fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset was determined by discounting the projected future cash flows associated with the underlying mutual fund contracts (such cash flows being dependent upon projected growth). Our discount rates were developed with input from valuation experts. We also determined that the useful life of this intangible asset was no longer indefinite and, accordingly, we reclassified the remaining acquired client relationships to definite-lived. For our remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each asset was greater than its carrying amount. Only a substantial decline in the fair value would indicate that an impairment may exist.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts between our Affiliates and their underlying investors, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We 36 Table of Contents monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them, if necessary. We review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships. Significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. We are currently amortizing our definite-lived intangible assets over an average useful life of approximately eleven years. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a material impact on our amortization expense. For example, if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of each of our definite-lived intangible assets by one year, our amortization expense would increase by approximately $10.0million per year.
We perform definite-lived intangible asset impairment tests annually, or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount. We assess each of our definite-lived acquired client relationships for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired relationships. Projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of each of these assets significantly exceed their carrying value and, accordingly, only a substantial decline in the undiscounted cash flows underlying these assets would indicate that an impairment may exist.
Equity and Cost Method Investments We evaluate equity and cost method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other-than-temporary. If we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value.
For companies with quoted market prices in active markets, we use these prices to determine the fair value of our equity and cost method investments. For companies without quoted market prices in active markets, we determine the fair values by applying a market multiple to the estimated cash flows of each investment. Our fair value multiples are supported by observed transactions and discounted cash flow analyses which reflect assumptions of current and projected levels of Affiliate assets under management, fee rates and estimated expenses. Changes in estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the fair value of these investments.
In the fourth quarter, we completed our evaluation of equity and cost method investments and no impairments were identified. Only a substantial decline in the fair value of any of these investments for a period that is considered other-than-temporary would indicate that an impairment may exist.
Contingent Payment Arrangements We periodically enter into contingent payment arrangements in connection with our business combinations. In these arrangements, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain levels of revenue growth are achieved. For consolidated Affiliates, we estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations by discounting the projected future payments (such estimates being dependent upon projected revenue) using current market rates. Our discount rates are developed with input from valuation experts. Our expected lives are determined based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangements.
We then accrete the obligation to its expected payment amount over the period until the arrangement is measured. If the expected payment amount subsequently changes, the obligation is reduced or increased in the current period resulting in a gain or loss. Both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
37 Table of Contents Changes to our projected future payment amounts could materially affect the amount of Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements we recognize in any period. For example, a 1%change in our assumed discount rate or a 1%change in our projected revenue (assuming all other factors remain constant) at Affiliates with these types of arrangements, would result in an increase or decrease to our Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements of $0.9million and $7.6million, respectively.
Redeemable Non-controlling Interests Redeemable non-controlling interests represent the currently redeemable value of our Affiliate partners' retained equity interests. We may pay for these Affiliate equity purchases in cash, shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration, at our election.
We generally value these interests upon their transfer or repurchase by applying market multiples to an Affiliate's cash flows, which is intended to represent fair value. The use of different assumptions could change the value of these interests, including the amount of compensation expense, if any, that we may report upon their transfer or repurchase.
Income Taxes Tax regulations often require income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements. Deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns. Our overall tax position requires analysis to estimate the expected realization of tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions, and, if so, the appropriate amount of the benefit.
Our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax-deductible intangible assets and convertible securities. Most of our intangible assets are tax-deductible because we generally structure our Affiliate investments to be taxable to the sellers. We record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes, but do amortize for tax purposes, thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes. These liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an Affiliate or an impairment. We are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability. As of December31, 2012, our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment was approximately $238.2million.
During 2012, our convertible securities generated deferred taxes of approximately $24.5million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported Interest expense. These deferred tax liabilities may be reclassified to equity if the securities convert to common stock.
We regularly assess our deferred tax assets in order to determine the need for valuation allowances. Our principal deferred tax assets are state operating losses, foreign tax credit carryforwards and the indirect benefits of uncertain foreign tax positions. In our assessment, we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets, which have limited lives. If we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset, we establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination. As of December31, 2012, our valuation allowances for state net operating losses and indirect tax benefits from uncertain tax positions were $19.7million, and $1.6million, respectively.
In our assessment of uncertain tax positions, we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain our tax position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a "more-likely-than-not" threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting this threshold, no benefit is recognized.
38 Table of Contents Changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings. For example, a 1%increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately $15.1million in our tax expense in the period of such determination.
Share-Based Compensation We have share-based compensation plans covering directors, senior management and employees. We calculate share-based compensation using the fair value of the awards on the grant date. Our share-based compensation plans typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment. We recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, including grants that are subject to graded vesting.
We estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options. In measuring expected volatility, we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock, as well as the current implied volatility from traded securities. In determining volatility, we have placed less emphasis on periods of high volatility that are not representative of our future expectations (see Note24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
We grant equity interests in our Affiliates to our management and Affiliate partners from time to time, with vesting, forfeiture and repurchase terms established at the date of grant. The fair value of the equity interest is determined as of the date of grant using a discounted cash flow analysis. Key valuation assumptions include projected assets under management, fee rates and discount rates.
Revenue Recognition The majority of our consolidated revenue represents asset-based advisory fees. Our Affiliates recognize asset-based advisory fees as they render services to their clients. In addition to generating asset-based fees, our Affiliates also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance and recognize performance fees when they are earned (i.e.when they become billable to customers).
International Operations In connection with our international distribution initiatives, we have offices in Sydney, Australia; London, England; Zurich, Switzerland; Hong Kong, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In addition, we have international operations through Affiliates who are based outside of the U.S.or have significant operations outside of the U.S., or who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non-U.S.clients. In the future, we may open additional offices, or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the U.S.There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles, difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable, different and in some cases, less stringent, regulatory and accounting regimes, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls, expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences. There can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our Affiliates that have international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Inflation We do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsMarket Risk" in Item7.

Item8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Affiliated Managers Group,Inc. (the "Company"), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting processes are designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's chief executive and chief financial officers and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other senior employees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
As of December31, 2012, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 was effective.
Management has excluded Veritable,LP ("Veritable") and Yacktman Asset ManagementLP ("Yacktman") from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 because they were acquired in a business combination in 2012. Veritable and Yacktman's combined total assets and combined total revenues represent 0.9% and 4.9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2012.
The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page41, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012.
40 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Affiliated Managers Group,Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Affiliated Managers Group,Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed under Item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Veritable,LP and Yacktman Asset ManagementLP from its assessment of internal 41 Table of Contents control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 because they were acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2012. We have also excluded Veritable,LP and Yacktman Asset ManagementLP from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Veritable,LP and Yacktman Asset ManagementLP are controlled subsidiaries of the Company whose total assets and total revenues represent 0.9% and 4.9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2012.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Organization and Nature of Operations Affiliated Managers Group,Inc. ("AMG" or the "Company") is a global asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of boutique investment management firms ("Affiliates"). AMG's Affiliates provide investment management services globally to institutional clients, mutual funds and high net worth individuals. Fees for services are largely asset-based and, as a result, the Company's revenue may fluctuate based on the performance of financial markets.
Affiliates are either organized as limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, or corporations. AMG generally has contractual arrangements ("revenue sharing arrangements") with its Affiliates. In many cases, a percentage of revenue is allocable to fund Affiliate operating expenses, including compensation (the "Operating Allocation"), while the remaining revenue (the "Owners' Allocation") is allocable to AMG and the other partners or members, generally with a priority to AMG. In other revenue sharing arrangements, AMG owns a minority interest that allocates to AMG a percentage of the Affiliate's revenue, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners. In certain other cases, the Affiliate is not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement, but instead operates on a profit-based model. In these cases, AMG participates fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). All dollar amounts, except per share data in the text and tables herein, are stated in millions unless otherwise indicated. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial statements to conform to the current year's presentation.
(b) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(c) Principles of Consolidation The Company evaluates the risk, rewards, and significant terms of each of its Affiliate and other investments to determine the appropriate method of accounting. Majority-owned or otherwise controlled investments are consolidated. In many of its Affiliate investments, AMG is, directly or indirectly, the sole general partner (in the case of Affiliates which are limited partnerships), managing partner (in the case of Affiliates which are limited liability partnerships), sole manager member (in the case of Affiliates which are limited liability companies) or principal shareholder (in the case of Affiliates which are corporations). As a result, the Company generally consolidates its Affiliate investments. Investments that are determined to be variable interest entities ("VIEs") are consolidated if AMG or a consolidated Affiliate is the primary beneficiary of the investment.
For consolidated Affiliates, the portion of the income allocated to owners other than AMG is included in Net income (non-controlling interests) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-controlling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes capital and undistributed income owned by the managers of the consolidated Affiliates. The current redemption value of non-controlling interests has been presented as Redeemable non-controlling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
AMG applies the equity method of accounting to investments where AMG does not hold a majority equity interest but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial 48 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) matters. AMG also applies the equity method when their unaffiliated minority shareholders or partners have certain rights to remove AMG or have rights to participate in substantive operating decisions (e.g.approval of annual operating budgets, major financings, selection of senior management, etc.). For equity method investments, AMG's portion of income before taxes is included in Income from equity method investments. Other investments in which AMG owns less than a 20% interest and does not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method, income is recognized as dividends when, and if, declared.
The effect of any changes in the Company's equity interests in its consolidated Affiliates resulting from the issuance or repurchase of an Affiliate's equity by the Company or one of its Affiliates is included as a component of stockholders' equity, net of the related income tax effect in the period of the change.
(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market mutual funds, with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value due to the short-term maturity of these investments.
(e) Investments in Marketable Securities Investments in marketable securities are classified as either trading or available-for-sale and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on investments classified as available-for-sale are reported, net of tax, as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Equity until realized. Unrealized gains or losses related to trading securities are reported within Other operating expenses in the period they occur. If a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale investment is determined to be other than temporary, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its fair value, and the difference is charged to income in the period incurred.
(f) Other Investments Assets of consolidated partnerships are reported within Prepaid expenses and other current assets. A majority of these assets are held by investors that are unrelated to the Company, and are therefore reported within Redeemable non-controlling interests. Income from these partnerships is presented as Investment and other (income) loss. The portion of this income or loss that is attributable to investors that are unrelated to the Company is reported within Net income (non-controlling interests).
Investments in partnerships that are not consolidated are reported within Other assets, with income from these partnerships presented as Investment and other (income) loss. Investments accounted for under the cost method are reported within Other assets, with dividend income presented, when and if declared, as Investment and other (income) loss.
(g) Fixed Assets Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of office equipment and furniture and fixtures range from three to ten years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease, and the building is amortized over 39years. The costs of improvements that extend the life of a fixed asset are capitalized, while the cost of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Land is not depreciated.
49 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (h) Leases The Company and its Affiliates currently lease office space and equipment under various leasing arrangements. As these leases expire, it can be expected that in the normal course of business they will be renewed or replaced. Leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases, as appropriate. Most lease agreements classified as operating leases contain renewal options, rent escalation clauses or other inducements provided by the landlord. Rent expense is accrued to recognize lease escalation provisions and inducements provided by the landlord, if any, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(i) Equity Investments in Affiliates For equity method investments, the Company's portion of income or loss before taxes is included in Income from equity method investments. The Company's share of income taxes incurred directly by Affiliates accounted for under the equity method are recorded within Income taxescurrent because these taxes generally represent the Company's share of the taxes incurred by the Affiliate. Deferred income taxes incurred as a direct result of the Company's investment in Affiliates accounted for under the equity method have been included in Income taxesintangible-related deferred. The associated deferred tax liabilities have been classified as a component of Deferred income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company periodically evaluates its equity method investments for impairment. In such impairment evaluations, the Company assesses if the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period considered to be other than temporary. If the Company determines that a decline in fair value below the carrying value of the investment is other than temporary, then the reduction in carrying value would be recognized in Income from equity method investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
(j) Acquired Client Relationships and Goodwill Each acquired Affiliate has identifiable assets arising from contractual or other legal rights with their clients ("acquired client relationships"). In determining the value of acquired client relationships, the Company analyzes the net present value of each acquired Affiliate's existing client relationships based on a number of factors including: the Affiliate's historical and potential future operating performance; the Affiliate's historical and potential future rates of attrition among existing clients; the stability and longevity of existing client relationships; the Affiliate's recent, as well as long-term, investment performance; the characteristics of the firm's products and investment styles; the stability and depth of the Affiliate's management team and the Affiliate's history and perceived franchise or brand value.
The Company has determined that certain of its mutual fund acquired client relationships meet the criteria to be considered indefinite-lived assets because the Company expects both the renewal of these contracts and the cash flows generated by these assets to continue indefinitely. Accordingly, the Company does not amortize these intangible assets, but instead reviews these assets annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that the recorded indefinite-lived assets may be impaired. Each reporting period, the Company assesses whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the indefinite life criteria are no longer met. If the indefinite life criteria are no longer met, the Company would assess whether the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to any such excess and these assets would be reclassified to definite-lived.
The expected useful lives of definite-lived acquired client relationships are analyzed each period and determined based on an analysis of the historical and projected attrition rates of each Affiliate's 50 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) existing clients, and other factors that may influence the expected future economic benefit the Company will derive from the relationships. The Company tests for the possible impairment of definite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If such indicators exist, the Company compares the undiscounted cash flows related to the asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flow amount, an impairment charge is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income for amounts necessary to reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value.
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized, and is reported within the segments in which the business operates. Goodwill is not amortized, but is instead reviewed for impairment. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss may be recorded.
(k) Revenue Recognition The Company's consolidated revenue primarily represents advisory fees billed monthly, quarterly and annually by Affiliates for managing the assets of clients. Asset-based advisory fees are recognized as services are rendered and are based upon a percentage of the value of client assets managed. Any fees collected in advance are deferred and recognized as income over the period earned. Performance based advisory fees are generally assessed as a percentage of the investment performance realized on a client's account, generally over an annual period. Performance-based advisory fees are recognized when they are earned (i.e.when they become billable to customers) based on the contractual terms of agreements and when collection is reasonably assured. Also included in revenue are commissions earned by broker dealers, recorded on a trade date basis, and other service fees recorded as earned.
(l) Issuance Costs Issuance costs incurred in securing credit facility financing are amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility. Costs incurred to issue debt are amortized over the shorter of the period to the first investor put or the Company's estimate of the expected term of the security. Costs associated with financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for separately as derivative instruments are charged directly to stockholders' equity.
(m) Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to interest rate risk inherent in its variable rate debt obligations. The Company's risk management strategy may utilize financial instruments, specifically interest rate derivative contracts to hedge certain interest rate exposures. In entering into these contracts, the Company intends to offset cash flow gains and losses that occur on its existing debt obligations with cash flow gains and losses on the contracts hedging these obligations.
From time to time, derivatives are used to hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt. These exposures are hedged with treasury rate locks (e.g.,a 10-year treasury lock hedging the anticipated underlying U.S. Treasury interest rate related to issuance of 10-year debt).
The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. If the Company's derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity and reclassified into earnings when the hedged cash flows are recorded in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is generally measured by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future 51 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) variable cash flows of the hedged contract with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future variable cash flows of the hedged item. To the extent that the critical terms of the hedged item and the derivative are not identical, hedge ineffectiveness would be reported in earnings as Interest expense. If the Company's derivatives do not qualify as cash flow or fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized as a gain or loss in Investment and other (income) loss.
(n) Contingent Payment Arrangements The Company periodically enters into contingent payment arrangements in connection with its business combinations. In these arrangements, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain levels of revenue growth are achieved. For consolidated Affiliates, the Company estimates the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and records a liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company then accretes the obligation to its expected payment amount over the period until the arrangement is measured. If the Company's expected payment amount subsequently changes, the obligation is reduced or increased in the current period resulting in a gain or loss. Both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. For Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, the Company records an obligation when a payment becomes probable with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the Affiliate.
(o) Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities are generally attributable to intangible assets, convertible securities and deferred revenue. Deferred tax assets are generally attributable to state and foreign loss carryforwards, deferred compensation and the benefit of uncertain tax positions.
In measuring the amount of deferred taxes each period, the Company must project the impact on its future tax payments of any reversal of deferred tax liabilities (which would increase the Company's tax payments), and any use of its state and foreign loss carryforwards (which would decrease its tax payments). In forming these estimates, the Company makes assumptions about future federal, state and foreign income tax rates and the apportionment of future taxable income to jurisdictions in which the Company has operations. An increase or decrease in federal or state income tax rates could have a material impact on the Company's deferred income tax liabilities and assets and would result in a current income tax charge or benefit.
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a "more-likely-than-not" threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and other charges relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional tax expense.
In the case of the Company's deferred tax assets, the Company regularly assesses the need for valuation allowances, which would reduce these assets to their recoverable amounts. In forming these estimates, the Company makes assumptions of future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets, which have limited lives. If the Company determines that these assets will be realized, the 52 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Company records an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be unable to realize additional amounts of deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such determination was made.
(p) Foreign Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of Affiliates whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. The revenue and expenses of these Affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the relevant period. Because of the permanent nature of the Company's investments, net translation exchange gains and losses are excluded from Net income but are recorded in Other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in Investment and other income.
(q) Share-Based Compensation Plans The Company recognizes expenses for all share-based payments based on their grant date fair values over the requisite service period.
The Company reports any tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options that are in excess of the expense recognized for reporting purposes as a financing activity in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. If the tax benefit realized is less than the expense, the tax shortfall is recognized in stockholders' equity. To the extent the expense exceeds available windfall tax benefits, it is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company was permitted to calculate its cumulative windfall tax benefits for the purposes of accounting for future tax shortfalls. The Company elected to apply the long-form method for determining the pool of windfall tax benefits.
(r) Recent Accounting Developments In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance. The new guidance clarifies existing fair value measurement principles and expands certain disclosure requirements, particularly for measurements categorized as Level3. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance that provides the option of performing a qualitative assessment before proceeding with a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Following an assessment of qualitative factors, if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is greater than its carrying amount, then a quantitative assessment is unnecessary. This guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The Company early-adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the guidance for reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The new guidance requires companies to present in a single note or on the face of the financial statements, the impact of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The new guidance is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2.Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments and, at times, certain financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are typically located in countries in which AMG and its Affiliates operate. For AMG and certain Affiliates, cash deposits at a financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 5.Fair Value Measurements The Company determines the fair value of certain investment securities and other financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, utilizing a hierarchy of three different valuation techniques: Level1 Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs, or significant value drivers, are observable; and Level3 Prices reflect the Company's own assumptions concerning unobservable inputs to the valuation model. These inputs require significant management judgment and reflect the Company's assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The following table summarizes the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Fair Value Measurements December31, 2011 Level1 Level2 Level3 Financial Assets Cash equivalents $ 23.2 $ 23.2 $  $  Investments in marketable securities (1) Trading securities 14.1 14.1   Available-for-sale securities 86.3 86.3   Other investments (2) 145.3 31.1 10.8 103.4 Financial Liabilities Contingent payment arrangements (3) $ 87.1 $  $  $ 87.1 Obligations to related parties (4) 92.0   92.0 Interest rate derivatives (5) 2.9  2.9  Fair Value Measurements December31, 2012 Level1 Level2 Level3 Financial Assets Cash equivalents $ 13.5 $ 13.5 $  $  Investments in marketable securities (1) Trading securities 13.6 13.6   Available for sale securities 115.3 115.3   Other investments (2) 155.4 15.7 20.8 118.9 Financial Liabilities Contingent payment arrangements (3) $ 31.0 $  $  $ 31.0 Obligations to related parties (4) 77.8   77.8 Interest rate derivatives (5) 4.0  4.0  (1) Principally investments in equity securities.

(4) Obligations to related parties are presented within Payables to related party and Other long-term liabilities.
(5) Interest rate derivatives are presented within Other long-term liabilities.
The following is a description of the significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value and the fair value methodologies used.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in money market funds. Cash investments in daily redeeming money market funds are classified as Level1.
Investments in marketable securities consist primarily of investments in publicly traded securities and in funds advised by Affiliates which are valued using net asset value ("NAV"). Publicly traded securities and investments in daily redeeming funds that calculate NAVs are classified as Level1.
Other investments are valued using NAV. Investments in daily redeeming funds that calculate NAVs are classified as Level1. Investments in funds that permit redemptions monthly or quarterly are classified as Level2. Investments in funds that are subject to longer redemption restrictions are classified as Level3. The fair value of Level3 assets is determined using NAV one quarter in arrears (adjusted for current period calls and distributions).
Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps. The fair value of these assets is determined by model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs were observable in active markets.
Contingent payment arrangements represent the present value of the expected future settlement of contingent payment arrangements related to the Company's investments in Affiliates. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of these obligations are growth and discount rates. Increases in the growth rate would result in a higher obligation while an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower obligation.
Obligations to related parties include agreements to repurchase Affiliate equity and liabilities offsetting certain investments which are held by the Company but economically attributable to a related party. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the agreements to repurchase Affiliate equity are growth and discount rates. Increases in the growth rate would result in a higher obligation while an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower obligation. The liability to a related party is measured based upon certain investments held by the Company, the fair value of which is determined using NAV one quarter in arrears.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) It is the Company's policy to value financial assets or liabilities transferred as of the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurs. There were no significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities in 2011 or 2012.
The Company relies on the NAV of certain investments as their fair value. The NAVs that have been provided by the investees have been derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the measurement dates. The following table summarizes, as of December31, 2011 and 2012, the nature of these investments and any related liquidation restrictions or other factors which may impact the ultimate value realized: December31, 2011 December31, 2012 Category of Investment Fair Value Unfunded Commitments Fair Value Unfunded Commitments Private equity fund-of-funds (1) $ 103.4 $ 80.5 $ 118.9 $ 75.4 Other funds (2) 47.2  68.9  $ 150.6 $ 80.5 $ 187.8 $ 75.4 (1) These funds primarily invest in a broad range of private equity funds, as well as making direct investments. Distributions will be received as the underlying assets are liquidated over the life of the funds, generally 15years.
(2) These are multi-disciplinary funds that invest across various asset classes and strategies including long/short equity, credit and real estate. Investments are generally redeemable on a daily or quarterly basis.
There are no current plans to sell any of these investments.
The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable approximates fair value because interest rates and other terms are at market rates. The carrying value of notes payable approximates fair value principally because of the short-term nature of the notes. The carrying value of senior bank debt approximates fair value because the debt is a credit facility with variable interest based on selected short-term rates. The fair market value of the senior notes at December31, 2012 was $351.8million. The fair market value of the 2008 senior convertible notes and the junior convertible trust preferred securities at December31, 2011 were $500.0million and $594.3million, respectively. The fair market value of the 2008 senior convertible notes and the junior convertible trust preferred securities at December31, 2012 were $510.6million and $719.9million, respectively. The senior bank debt, senior notes, senior convertible notes and junior convertible securities are classified as Level2 because the fair value was determined utilizing market quotes in non-active markets.
6.Variable Interest Entities Sponsored Investment Funds The Company's Affiliates act as the investment manager for certain investment funds that are considered variable interest entities ("VIEs"). In addition to an Affiliate's involvement as the investment manager, Affiliates may also hold investments in these products. Affiliates are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as their involvement is limited to that of a service provider and their 59 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) investment, if any, represents an insignificant interest in the fund's assets under management. As a result, the Company's variable interests will not absorb the majority of the variability of the entity's net assets and therefore the Company has not consolidated these entities.
Trust Preferred Vehicles The Company established wholly-owned trusts in connection with the 2006 and 2007 issuances of junior convertible trust preferred securities. These entities are considered VIEs and the Company is not the primary beneficiary, therefore these entities are not consolidated in the Company's financial statements.
The net assets and liabilities of these unconsolidated VIEs and the Company's maximum risk of loss related thereto are as follows: December31, 2011 December31, 2012 Category of Investment Unconsolidated VIE Net Assets Carrying Value and Maximum Exposure to Loss Unconsolidated VIE Net Assets Carrying Value and Maximum Exposure to Loss Sponsored investment funds $ 3,618.4 $ 1.1 $ 7,186.9 $ 0.8 Trust preferred vehicles 9.0 9.0 9.0 9.0 7.Fixed Assets and Lease Commitments Fixed assets consisted of the following: December31, 2011 2012 Building and leasehold improvements $ 59.1 $ 74.7 Office equipment 34.1 38.9 Furniture and fixtures 20.6 16.3 Land and improvements 17.9 18.1 Computer software 20.5 21.4 Fixed assets, at cost 152.2 169.4 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (83.1 ) (87.9 ) Fixed assets, net $ 69.1 $ 81.5 60 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.

AMG's other Affiliates generally have separate defined contribution retirement plans. Under each of the qualified plans, AMG and each participating Affiliate, as the case may be, are able to make discretionary contributions for the benefit of qualified plan participants up to Internal Revenue Service limits.
The Company has established a Deferred Compensation Plan that provides officers and directors of the Company the opportunity to voluntarily defer base salary, bonus payments and director fees, as applicable, on a pre-tax basis, and invest such deferred amounts in one or more specified measurement funds. While the Company has no obligation to do so, the Deferred Compensation Plan also provides the Company the opportunity to make discretionary contributions; in the event any such contributions are made, contributed amounts will be subject to vesting and forfeiture provisions.
Consolidated expenses related to the Company's benefit plans in 2010, 2011 and 2012 were $12.1million, $12.0million and $12.7million, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 10.Senior Bank Debt The Company has a $1,075.0million senior unsecured credit facility (the "credit facility"), consisting of an $825.0million revolving credit facility (the "revolver") and a $250.0million term loan (the "term loan"). The Company pays interest on any outstanding obligations at specified rates (based either on the LIBOR rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time). A portion of the revolver ($30.0million) matures in January 2015 with the balance of $795.0million and the term loan maturing in November 2016. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may increase the revolver and the term loan by up to $75.0million and $250.0million, respectively.
The credit facility is unsecured and contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, cash dividends, asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes.
As of December31, 2011 and 2012, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $250.0million and $325.0million, respectively. As further described in Note15, the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange a fixed rate for the variable rate on a portion of its credit facility.
11.Senior Notes At December31, 2012, the Company has two senior notes outstanding. The principal terms of these notes are summarized below.
2022 Senior Notes 2042 Senior Notes Issue date October 2012 August 2012 Maturity date October 2022 August 2042 Potential Call Date October 2015 August 2017 Par value (in millions) $ 140.0 $ 200.0 Call Price At Par At Par Stated coupon 5.25 % 6.375 % Coupon frequency Quarterly Quarterly The Company used the net proceeds from both the 2022 senior notes and the 2042 senior notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under its revolver.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (3) The Company may redeem the 2006 junior convertible trust preferred securities if the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds $195 per share for a specified period of time.
(4) These convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations, which require the Company to deduct interest in an amount greater than its reported Interest expense. These deductions result in annual deferred tax liabilities of approximately $24.5million. These deferred tax liabilities will be reclassified directly to stockholders' equity if the Company's common stock is trading above certain thresholds at the time of the conversion of the securities.
13.Forward Equity Sale Agreement In August 2012, the Company amended its forward equity agreement to increase the amount of shares of common stock it may sell to an aggregate of $400.0million. During 2012, the Company entered into contracts to sell a notional amount of $147.2million at an average share price of $121.37. The Company has the ability to settle the contracts either by delivering shares of common stock and receiving cash or net settling for cash or shares of common stock. All contracts remain outstanding.
14.Income Taxes The consolidated income tax provision includes taxes attributable to the controlling interest and, to a lesser extent, taxes attributable to non-controlling interests as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 Controlling Interests: Current tax $ 42.1 $ 45.0 $ 61.0 Intangible related deferred taxes 47.5 43.2 22.7 Other deferred taxes (9.3 ) (4.0 ) (12.1 ) Total controlling interests 80.3 84.2 71.6 Non-controlling Interests: Current tax $ 14.0 $ 12.9 $ 11.7 Deferred taxes (2.8 ) (4.0 ) 0.5 Total non-controlling interests 11.2 8.9 12.2 Provision for income taxes $ 91.5 $ 93.1 $ 83.8 Income before income taxes (controlling interest) $ 218.9 $ 249.1 $ 245.6 Effective tax rate attributable to controlling interests (1) 36.7 % 33.8 % 29.2 % (1) Taxes attributable to the controlling interest divided by Income before income taxes (controlling interest).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A summary of the consolidated provision for income taxes is as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 Current: Federal $ 12.8 $ 7.7 $ 19.4 State 9.9 9.7 11.3 Foreign 33.4 40.5 42.0 Total current 56.1 57.9 72.7 Deferred: Federal 43.2 47.4 19.4 State 2.7 4.4 3.0 Foreign (10.5 ) (16.6 ) (11.3 ) Total deferred 35.4 35.2 11.1 Provision for income taxes $ 91.5 $ 93.1 $ 83.8 The components of income before income taxes consisted of the following: For the Years Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 Domestic $ 186.3 $ 243.8 $ 238.6 International 192.6 208.9 256.6 $ 378.9 $ 452.7 $ 495.2 The Company's effective income tax rate differs from the amount computed by using income before income taxes and applying the U.S. federal income tax rate to such amount because of the effect of the following items: For the Years Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 Tax at U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2.0 2.4 4.6 Non-deductible expenses 0.1 0.5 0.8 Valuation allowance 1.0 (1.1 ) (5.9 ) Effect of foreign operations 0.5  (2.9 ) Foreign basis differences (0.7 ) (0.9 ) (0.4 ) Effect of changes in tax law, rates (1.2 ) (2.1 ) (2.0 ) Effect of income from non-controlling interests (12.5 ) (13.2 ) (12.2 ) 24.2 % 20.6 % 17.0 % During 2010, the Company increased its deferred tax valuation allowance $2.2million, principally for exposure to foreign tax credit carryforwards increasing its effective tax rate 1.0%. In both 2011 and 65 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2012, the Company reversed $2.8million of its valuation allowance, principally for state net operating losses that expired. In 2012, the Company also reduced the allowance $11.5million for foreign tax credit carryforwards and benefits of uncertain tax positions from improved projections of taxes in the U.S.
During 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Company realized a deferred tax benefit of $4.1million, $7.6million, and $7.3million, respectively, from the re-valuation of its deferred taxes from a change in enacted tax rates in the United Kingdom. These changes, which reduced taxes attributable to both the controlling and non-controlling interest, decreased the Company's effective tax rate 1.9%, 3.1% and 3.0% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Excluding the non-controlling interest tax benefits, the changes decreased the effective tax rate of the controlling interest 1.2%, 2.1% and 2.0% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
The Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are permanent in duration. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary. As of December31, 2012, the amount of such temporary difference was approximately $25.8million. The deferred taxes not recognized at December31, 2012 for this temporary difference are approximately $9.8million.
The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December31, 2011 2012 Deferred Tax Assets State net operating loss carryforwards $ 26.5 $ 23.9 Deferred compensation 17.5 23.9 Foreign tax credit carryforwards 15.1 20.1 Tax benefit of uncertain tax positions 11.6 17.6 Accrued expenses 11.6 6.0 Capital loss carryforwards 1.5 1.5 Total deferred tax assets 83.8 93.0 Valuation allowance (35.6 ) (21.3 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 48.2 $ 71.7 Deferred Tax Liabilities Intangible asset amortization $ (247.1 ) $ (238.2 ) Convertible securities interest (171.1 ) (189.2 ) Non-deductible intangible amortization (127.2 ) (120.1 ) Deferred revenue (5.6 ) (18.5 ) Other (3.2 ) (2.8 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (554.2 ) (568.8 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (506.0 ) $ (497.1 ) Deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of tax deductions for the Company's intangible assets and convertible securities. The Company amortizes most of its intangible assets for tax purposes only, reducing its tax basis below its carrying value for financial statement purposes and generating deferred taxes each reporting period. The Company's 2008 senior convertible notes and junior 66 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) convertible trust preferred securities also generate deferred taxes because the Company's tax deductions are higher than the interest expense recorded for financial statement purposes.
At December31, 2012, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards that expire over a 15-year period beginning in 2013. The Company also has foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire over a 10-year period beginning in 2013. The valuation allowances at December31, 2011 and December31, 2012 were principally related to the Company's projections of taxable income prior to the expiration of these state and federal carryforwards.
The Company carried a liability for uncertain tax positions of $24.6million, $21.3million and $22.6million as of December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. These amounts included $3.2million, $1.6million and $2.2million of interest and related charges, respectively. At December31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, these liabilities also included $16.7million, $12.6million and $19.4million, respectively, for tax positions that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 Balance, as of January1 $ 21.9 $ 24.6 $ 21.2 Additions based on current year tax positions 7.0 4.8 5.9 Additions based on prior years' tax positions   5.2 Reductions for prior years' tax provisions (1.2 )  (5.4 ) Settlements  (1.2 )  Reductions related to lapses of statutes of limitations (3.4 ) (6.7 ) (4.6 ) Additions (reductions) related to foreign exchange rates 0.3 (0.3 ) 0.3 Balance, as of December31 $ 24.6 $ 21.2 $ 22.6 During 2012, this liability decreased $5.4million as a result of the recognition of tax benefits from the transfer of interests in an Affiliate. This decrease was offset by a $5.2million provision for added foreign exposure for prior years. The Company does not anticipate that this liability will change significantly over the next twelve months.
The Company periodically has tax examinations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Examination outcomes, and any related settlements, are subject to significant uncertainty.

The Company does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks are intended to enable the Company to achieve a level of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt that is acceptable to management and to limit interest rate exposure.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company entered into Standard& Poor's 500 Index puts to limit the effect of a possible market downturn on its 2012 earnings. The Company recognized an expense of $1.2million for these positions, which had a notional value of $150.0million; the contracts expired on December31, 2012, and no gain was recognized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 17.Commitments and Contingencies The Company and its Affiliates are subject to claims, legal proceedings and other contingencies in the ordinary course of their business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to the Company or its Affiliates. The Company and its Affiliates establish accruals for matters for which the outcome is probable and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that any liability in excess of these accruals upon the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Certain Affiliates operate under regulatory authorities which require that they maintain minimum financial or capital requirements. Management is not aware of any significant violations of such financial requirements occurring during the period.
In connection with a past acquisition agreement, the Company has committed to co-invest in certain investment partnerships where it serves as the general partner. As of December31, 2012, these commitments totaled approximately $75.4million and may be called in future periods. The Company is contractually entitled to reimbursement from the prior owner for $36.8million of these commitments if they are called.
Under past acquisition agreements, the Company is contingently liable, upon achievement of specified financial targets, to make payments of up to $468.2million through 2017. As of December31, 2012, the Company expects to make payments of $200.8million to settle these contingent obligations (including $142.0million related to the Company's equity method investments). The net present value of the expected payments for consolidated Affiliates totals $34.2million as of December31, 2012. The Company expects to make $3.2million of payments in 2013. During 2012, the Company recognized net gains of $53.8million ($35.8million attributable to the controlling interest) as a result of changes to expected payments for consolidated Affiliates. These net gains have been classified within Imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
18.Business Combinations On June29, 2012, the Company completed majority investments in Veritable,LP ("Veritable") and Yacktman Asset ManagementLP ("Yacktman"). As discussed in Note21, the Company also completed an additional minority investment in BlueMountain Capital ManagementLLC ("BlueMountain").
The Company completed its purchase price allocation for Veritable by using a financial model that includes assumptions of market performance, net client cash flows and discount rates. The excess of the enterprise value over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, of which 100% was attributed to the Company's High Net Worth segment. The consideration paid (less net tangible assets acquired) is deductible for U.S. tax purposes over a 15-year life.
The Company completed its purchase price allocation for Yacktman by using a financial model that includes assumptions of market performance, net client cash flows and discount rates. The excess of the enterprise value over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, of which 91% and 9% was attributed to the Company's Mutual Fund and High Net Worth segments, respectively. The consideration paid (less net tangible assets acquired) is deductible for U.S. tax purposes over a 15-year life. As part of this investment, the Company is contingently liable to make payments of up to $75.0million over the next three to five years upon the achievement of specified revenue targets. The Company currently projects contingent payments totaling $55.6million, and as of December31, 2012, the present value of these payments was $31.0million.

New Affiliate investments during the twelve months ended December31, 2012, contributed $88.0million and $14.5million to the Company's revenue and earnings, respectively.
19.Affiliate Equity The Company periodically issues Affiliate equity interests to and repurchases Affiliate equity interests from its Affiliate partners. These transactions generally occur at fair value. However, if the equity is issued for consideration below the fair value of the equity or repurchased for consideration above the fair value of the equity, then such difference is recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period. The Company recognized compensation expenses related to Affiliate equity of $26.2million, $29.0million, and $38.0million (of which $14.5million, $22.1million, and $21.6million were attributable to the controlling interest) in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Many of the Company's operating agreements provide the Company a conditional right to call and Affiliate partners the conditional right to put their retained equity interests at certain intervals. The purchase price of these conditional purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliate's cash flow distributions, which is intended to represent fair value. Affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, 71 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) subject to the Company's approval or other restrictions. The Company, at its option, may pay for Affiliate equity purchases in cash, shares of its common stock or other forms of consideration and can consent to the transfer of these interests to other individuals or entities.

During 2011, the Company determined that fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets at one of its Affiliates, a growth-oriented manager of U.S. equity mutual funds, had declined below its carrying value and, accordingly, recognized an impairment of $9.2million.
During 2012, the Company completed impairment assessments on its goodwill and definite-lived acquired client relationships and no impairments were indicated. During 2012, the Company determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset at one of its Affiliates, a manager of growth-oriented U.S. equity mutual funds, had declined below its carrying value and, accordingly, recognized an impairment of $102.2million. The fair value of this asset ($38.2million) was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, a Level3 fair value measurement. The significant assumptions used in the valuation were assets under management (declining approximately 10% annually) and a discount rate of 15%. While the Company generally considers investment advisory contracts between its Affiliates and their sponsored registered investment companies to have an indefinite life, it was determined that the useful life of this asset was no longer indefinite. Accordingly, in 2012, the Company reclassified the remaining acquired client relationships to definite-lived and began to recognize amortization related to the asset.
For the Company's Affiliates that are consolidated, definite-lived acquired client relationships are amortized over their expected useful lives. As of December31, 2012, these relationships were being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately eleven years. The Company estimates that its consolidated annual amortization expense will be approximately $100million for the next five years, assuming no additional investments in new or existing Affiliates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 21.Equity Investments in Affiliates During the quarter ended September30, 2012, the Company announced and closed an additional investment in BlueMountain, a leading global credit alternatives manager. The Company continues to hold a minority interest and accounts for the investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company's purchase price allocation was measured using a financial model that includes assumptions of expected market performance and net client cash flows. The Company allocated $131.7million to acquired client relationships. The consideration paid will be deductible for U.S. tax purposes over a 15-year life.
For the Affiliates in which the Company holds a significant but non-controlling interest, the equity method of accounting is applied. The definite-lived acquired client relationships attributable to the Company's equity method investments are amortized over their expected useful lives. As of December31, 2012, these relationships were being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately nine years. The Company recognized amortization expense for these relationships of $32.9million for twelve months ended December31, 2011 as compared to $36.9million and for the twelve months ended December31, 2012. Assuming no additional investments in new or existing Affiliates, the Company estimates the annual amortization expense attributable to its current equity-method Affiliates for the next five years as follows: Year Ending December31, Estimated Amortization Expense 2013 $ 41.5 2014 20.0 2015 11.7 2016 8.9 2017 8.9 The following table presents summarized financial information for Affiliates accounted for under the equity method.

Any such Preferred Stock issued by the Company may rank prior to common stock as to dividend rights, liquidation preference or both, may have full or limited voting rights and may be convertible into shares of common stock.
Common Stock The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to 150.0million shares of Voting Common Stock and 3.0million shares of ClassB Non-Voting Common Stock. As more fully described in Note13, the Company is party to a forward equity sale agreement to issue new shares of the Company's common stock.
The Company's Board of Directors has also authorized share repurchase programs in recent periods. The maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under outstanding programs is 2.3million. The timing and amount of issuances and repurchases are determined at the discretion of AMG's management.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 24.Share-Based Compensation Share-Based Incentive Plans The Company has established various Stock Option and Incentive Plans under which it is authorized to grant stock options and stock appreciation rights. As of December31, 2012, there were 3,449,781 options available for grant under the plans.
The Company established an Executive Incentive Plan to align executive incentives with increases in stockholder value. The stockholders of the Company most recently approved an amendment to the plan in 2010 at the Company's annual meeting. Compensation payable under this plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has a Deferred Compensation Plan to provide additional retirement plan flexibility for our officers. The plan provides officers and directors the opportunity to voluntarily defer compensation on a pre-tax basis, and to notionally invest such deferred amounts in one or more specified measurement funds. The Company has a Long-Term Stock and Investment Plan (the "Long-Term Stock and Investment Plan"), under which the Company may grant cash awards that can be notionally invested in one or more specified measurement funds.
The Company implemented the Long-Term Equity Incentive Plans in 2010, 2011 and 2012 under which the Company grants equity interests to employees and officers. Under the plans, equity interests may be granted to management from time to time, with vesting, forfeiture and repurchase arrangements established under the plans at the time of grant. The equity interest structure is similar to the equity structure employed with the Company's Affiliate principals, with a ratable portion of ownership interests in all Affiliates transferred to a partnership, with grants of equity interests that have rights to cash flow deferred seven years from the date of grant.
Stock Options Pursuant to the option plans discussed above, stock options generally vest over a period of three to five years and expire seven to ten years after the grant date. All options have been granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.

25.Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, but adjusts for the dilutive effect of the potential issuance of incremental shares of the Company's common stock. The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and 78 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.

Under the if-converted method, shares that are issuable upon conversion are deemed outstanding, regardless of whether the securities are contractually convertible into the Company's common stock at that time. For this calculation, the interest expense (net of tax) attributable to these dilutive securities is added back to Net income (controlling interest), reflecting the assumption that the securities have been converted. Issuable shares for these securities and related interest expense are excluded from the calculation if an assumed conversion would be anti-dilutive to diluted earnings per share.
The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the years ended December31, 2010. For the twelve months ended December31, 2011 and 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 0.7million and 0.6million shares of common stock under the share repurchase programs approved by the Company's Board of Directors.
The diluted earnings per share calculations in the table above exclude the anti-dilutive effect of the following shares: For the Years Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 Stock options and other awards 1.3 1.2 0.7 Senior convertible securities 3.6 3.6 3.6 Junior convertible trust preferred securities 4.2 4.2 4.2 Forward equity sales   0.2 As discussed further in Note19, the Company may settle portions of its Affiliate equity purchases in shares of its common stock. Because it is the Company's intent to settle these potential repurchases in cash, the calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes any potential dilutive effect from possible share settlements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 26.Financial Instruments and Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks brought on by changes in interest and currency exchange rates. The Company has not entered into foreign currency transactions or derivative financial instruments to reduce risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. The Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce risks associated with changes in interest rates.
Notional amounts and credit exposures of derivatives The notional amount of derivatives does not represent amounts that are exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of the Company's exposure. The amounts exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional or contract amounts, as well as on other terms of the interest rate derivatives and the volatility of these rates and prices.
The Company would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties that issued the financial instruments, although the Company does not expect that the counter parties to interest rate derivatives will fail to meet their obligations, given their typically high credit ratings. The credit exposure of derivative contracts is represented by the positive fair value of contracts at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of master netting agreements and collateral posted by the counterparty.
Interest Rate Risk Management From time to time, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate risk. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are intended to enable the Company to achieve a level of variable-rate or fixed-rate debt that is acceptable to management and to limit interest rate exposure. The Company agrees with another party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.

29.Segment Information Management has assessed and determined that the Company operates in three business segments representing the Company's three principal distribution channels: Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth, each of which has different client relationships.
Revenue in the Institutional distribution channel is earned from relationships with public and private client entities, including pension plans, foundations, endowments and sovereign wealth funds. Revenue in the Mutual Fund distribution channel is earned from advisory and sub-advisory 81 Table of Contents AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) relationships with all domestically-registered investment products as well as non-institutional investment products that are registered abroad. Revenue in the High Net Worth distribution channel is earned from relationships with wealthy individuals, family trusts and managed account programs.
Revenue earned from client relationships managed by Affiliates accounted for under the equity method is not consolidated with the Company's reported Revenue but instead is included (net of operating expenses, including amortization) in Income from equity method investments, and reported in the distribution channel in which the Affiliate operates. Income tax attributable to the profits of the Company's equity method Affiliates is reported within the Company's consolidated income tax provision.
In firms with revenue sharing arrangements, a certain percentage of revenue is allocated for use by management of an Affiliate in paying operating expenses of that Affiliate, including salaries and bonuses, and is called an "Operating Allocation." In reporting segment operating expenses, Affiliate expenses are allocated to a particular segment on a pro rata basis with respect to the revenue generated by that Affiliate in such segment. Generally, as revenue increases, additional compensation is typically paid to Affiliate management partners from the Operating Allocation. As a result, the contractual expense allocation pursuant to a revenue sharing arrangement may result in the characterization of any growth in profit margin beyond the Company's Owners' Allocation as an operating expense. All other operating expenses (excluding intangible amortization) and interest expense have been allocated to segments based on the proportion of cash flow distributions reported by Affiliates in each segment.
