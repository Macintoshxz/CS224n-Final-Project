ITEM 1.  BUSINESS  Equifax Inc. is a leading source of consumer and commercial credit information worldwide. The Company provides to a wide range of customers information management, consumer credit information, marketing, business information, and identity verification services to enable credit and business decisions. The Company, through its Consumer Direct business, provides credit reporting and identity theft monitoring services direct to consumers enabling them to proactively manage their credit health and safeguard against identity theft. The Company is the market leader for credit information services in North America.  The Company operates in 13 countries: North America (the United States and Canada), Europe (the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Portugal) and Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Peru, and Uruguay).  2001 HIGHLIGHTS  In 2001, Equifax continued to refocus and realign its businesses to drive shareholder value. Mid-year, the Company completed the spin-off of its Payment Services division. Excluding discontinued operations and divested businesses, Equifax reported record operating results, which were largely attributable to performance in our North American Information Services segment. Other 2001 financial highlights include the following (excluding divested and discontinued operations):     .  Consolidated revenues increased 8% to $1.1 billion.    .  Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $1.15, before restructuring and       other charges of $60 million (pre-tax).    .  Consolidated operating margins were 29%.    .  North American revenues increased 13% and operating income increased 14%.    .  U.S. consumer reporting volumes grew 20%.    .  The Consumer Direct business more than tripled revenues.    .  Free cash flow grew to $208 million, a 72% increase over 2000.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  The Company was founded as a credit reporting agency under the name "Retail Credit Company" in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1899 and soon expanded into investigation of applicants for insurance. The company has continued to expand on a domestic and international basis and to diversify by means of internal development and strategic acquisitions. We have been publicly owned since 1965, listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1971, and are a member of the S&P 500. In 1975, the Company changed its name from "Retail Credit Company" to "Equifax Inc."  The Company expanded operations into credit card services with the acquisition of Telecredit in 1990 and into direct marketing in 2000 with the purchase of the Consumer Information Solutions Group of R.L. Polk & Co. During the last five years, the Company has redefined and sharpened its business focus with the goal of creating additional shareholder value. In 1997, the Company divested its insurance services operations through the spin-off of a subsidiary company to shareholders. In 2000, the Company sold its risk management collections businesses in the United States, Canada and the U.K. And in July 2001, the Company completed the spin-off of its Payment Services segment (the acquired Telecredit business) by distributing to its shareholders the common stock of Certegy Inc. ("Certegy"), as a tax free dividend.  Equifax is a holding company that conducts its business operations through subsidiary companies. The Company's business areas are divided into separate groups and are conducted on a "profit center" basis with self-contained functional integrity. Equifax supplies centralized overall financial, legal, communications, media relations, tax and similar services.  Equifax is not dependent on any single customer, and the Company's largest customer provides less than 3% of the Company's total revenues.  The Company reports its financial results in five segments -- North American Information Services, Equifax Europe, Equifax Latin America, Other, and Divested Operations. Detailed financial results and segment information are provided under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  A description of the Company's products and services by line of business is provided below:                                         2 INFORMATION SERVICES  Information Services, which is our largest line of business, maintains value-added information on more than 400 million consumers and businesses, and is the market leader in credit information services in North America. Information Services encompasses a number of businesses, all of which derive their products and services from our proprietary databases and expert knowledge. We will seek continued growth by developing innovative products and services, maintaining the quality of our databases, and delivering superior service.  For financial reporting purposes, the Information Services business is reported geographically in North American Information Services, Equifax Europe and Equifax Latin America segments. The principle lines of business are:  Consumer Services.  Our consumer reporting business maintains files on over 300 million individuals worldwide with information updated constantly. Our consumer products provide information about individuals in a variety of services that include credit reporting, credit scoring, risk management, fraud detection, identity verification, modeling and analytics. Customers access our products largely through electronic distribution, including direct real-time access, which facilitates instant decisions.  Customers include banks, mortgage lenders, retailers, financial institutions, automotive manufacturers and dealers, telecommunications and utility companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and government. Our customers utilize the information we provide to make decisions for a wide range of credit and business purposes, such as mortgage or auto loans, credit card applications, identity verification and similar business uses.  Marketing Services.  This line of business includes our credit marketing, risk management and decisioning, and direct marketing services businesses. Credit marketing offers prescreening services, which facilitate pre-approved offers of credit by banks and financial institutions. Equifax risk management and fraud detection and prevention services enable banks and financial institutions to minimize their default rates by proactively managing their existing credit card accounts. Our decisioning analytics and platforms enable customers to make credit, cross-selling, and other business decisions instantaneously while streamlining application processing.  Our direct marketing services business provides consumer, demographic and lifestyle information. Direct marketing products include data capture, database management and registration card programs for consumer durable goods manufacturers. Our products enable customers to target specifically defined market segments and design more effective and economically efficient marketing campaigns. Customers include financial institutions, insurers, catalogers, publishers, technology companies, and manufacturers.  Commercial Services.  Our commercial business consists of selling products and services based on information that we maintain about businesses. Consistent with our strategy of expanding markets, in 2001 we continued to develop our commercial business in the United States by growing our Small Business Financial Exchange, a facility which brings together more than 20 of the leading financial institutions and small business lenders to report and maintain comprehensive trade line data on small businesses. We also operate the proprietary National Telecommunication Data Exchange, which includes default commercial account information from 72 telecommunications companies.  Our subsidiaries in Canada, the U.K., and Spain also sell commercial information to a wide variety of customers, and our subsidiary in Brazil is the leading commercial credit information vendor in that country.  CONSUMER DIRECT SERVICES  In 2000, the Company began offering credit information direct to consumers in the United States via the Internet at www.equifax.com. Equifax Credit Profile(R),our first product, provides secure online access to a user-friendly credit report. In 2001, the Company introduced Equifax Credit Watch(TM), our credit monitoring service, which is a subscription service that provides the consumer with several Equifax Credit Profiles and e-mail alerts whenever there has been an inquiry to his/her credit file. Once alerted, the consumer can view the details of the inquiry on-line and protect against identity fraud. In 2001, Equifax Credit Watch(TM) was named one of the 25 "Best Products of 2001" by Business Week Magazine.  Also in 2001, we introduced ScorePower(TM), the only on-line service that allows consumers access to their BEACON(TM) score. ScorePower purchasers receive their Equifax Credit Profile, the Beacon Score calculated from that profile, together with an explanation regarding their score and suggestions on how to favorably affect it.                                         3 Consumer Direct more than tripled its revenues in 2001 and offers strong growth potential for the Company. We intend to continue to prudently expand the product offerings, expand geographically, and develop creative marketing strategies for profitable growth. Customers of Consumer Direct include consumers, as well as businesses that offer Consumer Direct products to their employees or customers. Consumer Direct is reported in the North American Information Services segment.  PRODUCTS  Our businesses offer a variety of products that enable customers to operate their businesses with efficiency. We are constantly seeking to expand our product and service offerings. Generally, we expand product offerings through internal development or by acquisition. Recent new products generated through internal development include our patented eIDverifier(R) Internet identity verification products and our decisioning platforms. We may also partner with a third party to provide a product. The recent acquisition of our Direct Marketing Services business provided us with a range of proven marketing products. We continue to leverage our investments in our proprietary databases to develop and deliver progressively more value-added products across all our businesses.  Distribution of products and services to customers is made primarily through electronic data interfaces. We seek to manage costs and provide superior customer service through technological innovation. Our web-based initiative Equifax ePORT(TM), which enables delivery of information to customers via a secured Internet connection, is an example of our creative use of technology. We will continue to capitalize on the most efficient and effective means of delivering products and services.  DATA SOURCES  We rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers and various government and public record services. Additionally, we also rely on certain contractual relationships with certain affiliated third party-credit reporting agencies to provide us data in certain geographic areas.  Our Direct Marketing Services business provides us with a proprietary database consisting of consumer, lifestyle and demographic information. This database provides us the opportunity to develop new products and to explore cross-selling synergies with our existing data businesses. Similarly, through our acquisition in October 2000 of Compliance Data Center, Inc., we acquired the leading database for customer information services to the brokerage industry.  We are committed to enhancing, expanding and maintaining the integrity of our proprietary databases.  COMPETITION  Equifax operates in a number of geographic, product and service markets, which are highly competitive. We primarily compete with two global consumer credit reporting companies, Experian Information Solutions, Inc. and Trans Union LLC, which offer credit-reporting products that are similar to those we offer. We also compete with these and other companies that offer marketing information products and services, including Acxiom Corporation and InfoUSA, Inc. In commercial reporting, our primary competitor is D&B.  EMPLOYEES  The Company had approximately 5,200 employees in 13 countries as of December 31, 2001. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  REGULATORY  Because our business involves the collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions, certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation under various U. S. federal laws including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as similar state laws. We are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business. It is the Company's policy to treat all information with a high degree of security reflecting our recognition of individuals' privacy concerns. Certain of our businesses, notably our Direct Marketing Services business, are less regulated than the credit-based portions of our business.                                         4 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT  The Company's officers as of February 28, 2002 are listed below: Officer Name                  Position With Company                                       Age          Since ----                  ---------------------                                       ---          ------- Thomas F.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS                   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the Company's results, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Equifax Inc. is a leading source of consumer and commercial credit information worldwide. The Company provides to a wide range of customers information management, consumer credit information, marketing, business information, and identity verification services to enable credit and business decisions. The Company, through its Consumer Direct business, provides credit reporting and identity theft monitoring services direct to consumers enabling them to proactively manage their credit health and safeguard against identity theft. The Company is the market leader for credit information services in North America.  Equifax Inc.'s 2001 financial reporting was significantly impacted by the spin-off of its Payment Services business ("Certegy"), divestitures of non-core businesses ("Divested Operations"), and restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding these transactions, Equifax reported record revenues, earnings and cash flow for its core business, largely attributable to performance in its North American Information Services businesses. Significant 2001 financial highlights were:    -  Consolidated revenues increased 8% to $1.1 billion.   -  Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $1.15, before restructuring      and other charges of $60 million (pre-tax).   -  Consolidated operating margins were 29%.   -  North American revenues increased 13% and operating income increased 14%.   -  U.S. consumer reporting volumes grew 20%.   -  The Consumer Direct business more than tripled revenues.   -  Free cash flow grew to $208 million, a 72% increase over 2000.  Significant Transactions  On July 7, 2001, Equifax completed the spin-off of Certegy into a separate, publicly traded company. The spin-off permitted both companies to focus on growth in their core businesses with dedicated resources, and the continued creation of shareholder value. As a result of the spin-off, the Company's financial statements have been prepared with Certegy's net assets, results of operations and cash flows classified as "discontinued operations," with all historical financial statements restated to conform to this presentation.  In October 2001, the Company divested its City Directory business and, in the fourth quarter of 2000, sold its global risk management and U.K. vehicle information businesses. Combined revenues for these businesses in 2001 and 2000 were $29 million and $162 million, respectively, with a 2001 operating loss of $3.6 million and 2000 operating income of $9.0 million. The operating results of these businesses are classified in Divested Operations for segment reporting purposes.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, restructuring and other charges were recorded in connection with efforts to properly size and configure our post-spin business and to align our cost structure in our international operations. The charge totaled $60 million ($35 million after tax or $0.25 per diluted share) and consisted of approximately $37 million for employee severance and facilities consolidation and $23 million to write down several technology investments.                                         8 Financial Results  The following table summarizes Equifax's Core Business and As Reported results from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.

Adjustments to reconcile the As Reported results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 to the Core Business results and the associated impact on diluted earnings per share are as follows:    - Exclude the operating results and disposition gains and losses of Divested     Operations   - Exclude the 2001 restructuring and other charges   - Adjust other income and interest expense to reflect the impact of the     proceeds from Divested Operations   - Adjust the effective income tax rate, which reflects the above adjustments  See Exhibit 99.8 to this report for a more detailed analysis of the reconciling adjustments for Core Business results of operations.
Earnings Per Share (Diluted):                         2001        2000       1999 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Continuing operations, As Reported                   $0.84       $1.04      $ 1.06 Adjustments: -Exclude the 2001 restructuring and other charges     0.25          -           - -Adjust for the impacts of Divested Operations        0.05        0.03       (0.05) -Adjust income taxes                                    -         0.04       (0.01)                                                      ----------------------------- Continuing operations, Core Business                 $1.15       $1.10      $ 1.00                                                      ----------------------------- The following discussion of revenue, operating income, and segment results is on a Core Business basis (as previously described). The discussion of other income (expense), net, interest expense, and effective tax rates is on an As Reported basis.  Revenue       Revenues of $1.1 billion in 2001 increased 8% over 2000, driven by our North American Information Services segment's record consumer credit reporting volumes and growth in our Consumer Direct business. In 2001, North America accounted for 77% of the Company's total revenue and 90% of the operating income before corporate expense. Revenue growth in North America was 13%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, particularly in Latin America, negatively impacted revenue $27 million or 3%. Incremental revenues from our acquisitions in 2000 positively impacted revenue growth approximately 4%.      Revenues of $1.0 billion in 2000 increased 12% over 1999. Revenue growth was significantly influenced by the May 2000 acquisition of our Direct Marketing Services business, formerly the Consumer Information Solutions Group ("CIS") from R.L. Polk & Co. Excluding the impact of the CIS acquisition, revenue growth was 3%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies during 2000, particularly the British pound and Spanish peseta, reduced 2000 revenue by approximately $15 million or 2%.                                          9 Operating Income       Operating income in 2001 increased 6% to $317.8 million on operating margins of 29%. North America's operating income growth of 14% and 40 basis point margin improvement driven by consumer reporting and Consumer Direct offset margin deterioration in our international operations, particularly in Europe.       Operating income in 2000 grew 12% to $299.6 million with operating margins of 29%. Excluding the CIS acquisition, profit growth was 7%. Operating income growth in our traditional U.S. credit marketing services business, Canada's consumer reporting business and improved operating expenses drove 2000 performance.  Other Income (Expense), Net       Other income (expense), net includes interest income on cash balances of $3.2 million in 2001, $7.5 million in 2000, and $5.8 million in 1999. Lower cash balances in foreign operations combined with lower interest rates accounted for the decline in 2001. Other income (expense), net in 2001 and 2000 includes losses associated with the disposition of Divested Operations. In October 2001, the Company sold its City Directory business, which generated a pre-tax loss of $5.8 million. The sale of the risk management and vehicle information businesses generated pre-tax losses of $4.2 million in 2000. In 1999, the Company sold three risk management offices located in the U.S. that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million.  Interest Expense       Interest expense decreased $8.0 million in 2001 and increased $13.6 million in 2000, as compared with prior years. The decrease in 2001 from 2000 was due to lower average debt outstanding and lower effective borrowing rates. The increase in 2000 resulted from higher average debt outstanding associated with 2000 acquisition activity and 1999 treasury stock purchases. After adjusting for the $275 million debt reduction related to the spin-off of Certegy, average total debt outstanding was $775.4 million in 2001, $824.8 million in 2000 and $699.0 million in 1999.  Effective Tax Rates       The effective tax rates from continuing operations were 42.1%, 43.4% and 40.3% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Changes in the levels of non-deductible goodwill associated with divestitures and in the levels of foreign earnings accounted for the changes in effective tax rates between periods. The effective rate in 2002 is expected to decline to approximately 40%, due to the elimination of goodwill amortization and the effects of tax planning strategies.  Segment Results  The following table summarizes the segment results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. The results of businesses sold in October 2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000 are classified as Divested Operations. The Company's previous Consumer Information Services segment results are now reported in the North American Information Services segment.
