3 PARTI ITEM 1.
BUSINESS Overview We were founded in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1899, incorporated in Georgia in 1913, and have been known as Equifax Inc. since 1975. We have been publicly owned since 1965, listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1971 and are a member of the S&P 500.
We collect, organize and manage numerous types of credit, financial, public record, demographic and marketing information regarding individuals and businesses. This information originates from a variety of sources including financial or credit granting institutions, governmental entities and consumers. Our proprietary databases contain information on more than 400 million consumers and businesses worldwide. The original data is compiled and processed utilizing our proprietary software and systems and distributed to customers in a variety of user-friendly and value-add formats. Our products and services include consumer credit information, information database management, marketing information, business credit information, decisioning and analytical tools, and identity verification services which enable businesses to make informed decisions about extending credit or service, mitigate fraud, manage portfolio risk, and develop marketing strategies for consumers and small businesses. We also enable consumers to manage and protect their financial affairs through a portfolio of products that we sell directly via the Internet and in various hard-copy formats.
We currently operate in 12 countries: North America (the U.S. and Canada), Europe (the U.K., Ireland, Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Peru and Uruguay). We serve customers across a wide range of industries, including the financial services, retail, telecommunications, utilities, automotive, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. Our revenue stream is highly diversified with our largest customer providing less than 2% of total revenues.
4 Current Developments Acquisition of APPRO Systems,Inc.
On March15, 2005, we acquired APPRO Systems,Inc. (APPRO), a privately-held corporation headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. APPRO is a provider of automated credit risk management and financial technologies for consumer, commercial and retail banking lending operations. We paid $92.0 million in cash to the stockholders and optionholders of APPRO, subject to adjustment as provided in the merger agreement. The net cash impact to Equifax of the acquisition will be approximately $74.0 million after disposition of certain assets.
CEO Transition On August18, 2004, Equifax announced that Thomas F. Chapman, chairman and chief executive officer, informed the Board of Directors of his decision to retire after a successor is elected and the transition completed. The Board requested that Mr.Chapman remain through 2005 or such earlier period of time as would be necessary to ensure an orderly transition. On December20, 2004, Equifax entered into a transition retirement agreement with Mr.Chapman for this purpose.
FACT Act of 2003 During 2004 we established, along with the other nationwide credit reporting agencies, a centralized request facility, Central Source, LLC, which is owned jointly by Equifax, Experian Information Solutions, Inc. and TransUnion LLC, to provide to consumers, upon their request, a free annual credit file disclosure. During 2005, the initial implementation of the annual free credit report required by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) will be completed, and our related regulatory recovery fee will remain in effect as we continue to address the challenges involved in complying with the FACT Act. We believe we have identified and produced cost efficiencies and productivity gains in our business which, when combined with the regulatory recovery fee, enable us to comply with the FACT Act while delivering the most efficient and effective service to our customers. Consumer use of the centralized request facility to date has been within the range of our budgeted estimates. For additional information on the FACT Act, see PartI, BusinessGovernment Regulation below and PartII, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk Factors, below.
Segment Reporting We manage our business and report our financial results through the following three reportable segments:  Equifax North America  Equifax Europe  Equifax Latin America Each reportable segment, to varying degrees, is made up of three operating segments:  Information Services  Marketing Services  Personal Solutions (formerly referred to as Consumer Direct) Detailed financial results and segment information are provided below in PartII, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Segment Information.

Sales and Distribution We have a worldwide sales organization with approximately 930 employees as of December31, 2004 including sales management and administration. We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force, although the sales channels used by us can and will vary by product and service depending on market and business needs. We also sell and market our products and services through indirect sales channels, such as affiliate credit bureaus, marketing alliances and value-added resellers. We also sell through direct mail and various websites, such as www.equifax.com, which is the primary distribution channel for our Personal Solutions products and services.
We primarily distribute our products and services to customers worldwide through electronic data interfaces. Our enabling technologies platforms are developed in an ASP format to allow for ease of integration into customers inhouse technology systems and to leverage Equifaxs extensive technological system and communication network. Equifax ePORT, our web-based product delivery channel, enables us to deliver services to customers via a secure Internet connection. The success of our Personal Solutions product line is directly linked to delivery of products to consumers through a secure Internet channel. We will continue to leverage technology to capitalize on the most efficient and effective means of delivering products and services to our customers.
Product Development Our products and services are based on proprietary technology and databases enabling customers to operate their businesses efficiently and effectively. We constantly expand our product and service offerings through internal development, partnering with third parties or by acquisition.
Data Sources We rely extensively on data from external sources for our proprietary and non-proprietary databases. These sources include financial or credit granting institutions, which provide loan and accounts receivable information; governmental entities, which provide public records of bankruptcies, liens and judgments; and consumers, who participate in surveys and submit warranty cards from which we gather demographic and 9 marketing information. Our Information Services product line relies predominately on data received from customers via contractual relationships and from various government and public record services. Additionally, in the U.S. we also rely on contractual relationships with a limited number of affiliate third party credit reporting agencies to provide us data in certain geographic areas. Outside of the U.S., governmental data sources are generally more significant to our business.
Our Marketing Services operating segment, with the exception of the Credit Marketing Services products, is derived from proprietary databases consisting of consumer, lifestyle and demographic information. The majority of this information is gathered by consumers reporting information on warranty cards, voluntarily providing information via websites maintained by us, or otherwise requesting certain types of information. This permission-based information is generally less regulated and restricted than the credit information that we maintain. See Government Regulation below. These databases provide us with the opportunity to develop new products to explore cross-selling synergies with all of our databases. Our Credit Marketing Services products utilize information derived from the credit-based consumer data that also underlies our Information Services segments.
The databases underlying our Information Services and Marketing Services segments include numerous generalized databases and specialized databases of varying sizes. Some of these databases are subject to regulatory or contractual restrictions regarding usage. All databases are regularly updated by information provided by banks, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, other trade credit providers and governments, and we are committed to enhancing, expanding and maintaining the integrity of our proprietary databases. Our Personal Solutions product line relies on the consumer credit information databases, which support our Consumer Services products.
Government Regulation Since our business involves the collection of consumer data and the distribution of such information to businesses who make credit, service and marketing decisions, certain of our activities and products and services are subject to regulation under various local, state and federal laws in the U.S. governing consumer report data and consumer reporting agencies, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which regulates the use of consumer credit information and, to a lesser extent, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions. The FACT Act amended the FCRA and requires us, among other things, annually to provide free credit reports to requesting consumers on a phased-in basis beginning on December1, 2004 (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming); March1, 2005 (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin); June1, 2005 (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas); and September1, 2005 (Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Puerto Rico and all U.S. territories). Additional provisions of the FACT Act impose requirements designed to reduce consumer identity theft, limit provision of medical information and require reports to the FTC regarding consumer complaints.
We are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business, including the European Unions Privacy Directive. The U.K.s Data Protection Act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use third-party data. Recent regulatory limitations affect our use of the Electoral Roll, one of our key data sources in the U.K. Generally, the data underlying the products offered by our U.K. Information Services and Personal Solutions product lines, excluding our Commercial Services products, are subject to these regulations.
The information underlying our U.S. Commercial Services and Direct Marketing Services business is less regulated than the other portions of our business. A significant portion of the information maintained 10 by our Marketing Services business is voluntarily provided by individuals, rendering it subject to fewer restrictions on use. It is our policy, however, to treat all information with a high degree of security reflecting our recognition of individuals privacy concerns.
Intellectual Property We generally seek protection under federal, state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, registrations, confidentiality or other agreements or protections. Equifax owns several patents registered in the U.S. and certain foreign countries, the more important of which cover various aspects of and relating to the use of data within a consumer credit file. Equifax also has certain registered trademarks in the U.S. and in many foreign countries. The most important of these is Equifax and many variations thereof. These marks are used in connection with most of our product lines and services. Although these patents and trademarks are important and valuable assets in the aggregate, no single patent, group of patents or trademark is critical to the success of our business. We do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations.
We license other companies to use certain data, technology and other intellectual property rights we own or control, primarily as core components of our products and services, on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards.
We are licensed by others to use certain data, technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control, none of which is material to our business except for licenses from (1)Fair Isaac Corporation, relating to certain credit scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived therefrom, which licenses have varying durations and generally provide for usage-based fees; and (2)Seisint,Inc., relating to a software platform which facilitates sales by our Direct Marketing Services and Credit Marketing Services units, which licenses have ten-year terms beginning in 2002 and may be renewed on an annual basis thereafter.
Competition We operate in a number of geographic, product and service markets, which are highly competitive. Our Information Services products primarily compete with the products of two global consumer credit reporting companies, Experian Information Solutions,Inc. and TransUnion LLC, which offer a range of consumer credit reporting products that are similar to products we offer. We believe that our products and services offer customers an advantage over those of our competitors because of the quality of our data files, which we believe to be superior in terms of depth and accuracy. Our competitive strategy is to rely on product features and quality while remaining competitive on price. Experian and Dun& Bradstreet,Inc. are the major competitors for our Commercial Services products, although we believe we have a unique database and product for the small business segment of that market. Our Marketing Services products also compete with these companies and others who offer demographic information products and services, including Acxiom Corporation, Harte-Hanks,Inc. and InfoUSA,Inc. We believe the Marketing Services products and services are superior and, in some cases unique compared to those offered by our competitors at comparable prices. Our Personal Solutions products and services compete with similar offerings sold directly by Experian and TransUnion and also with offerings from a number of resellers of consumer credit information sold by Experian, TransUnion and us. We tailor our pricing of Personal Solutions products to the needs of the market, which can change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the consumer market. We change our pricing periodically to accommodate new product introductions, or other market conditions.
11 Employees We employed approximately 4,400 employees in 12 countries as of December31, 2004. The Equifax North America segment employed 2,558 of these employees, Equifax Europe employed 582, Equifax Latin America employed 975 and 264 were employed by General Corporate. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and no work stoppageshave been experienced. Pursuant to local laws, our employees in Brazil and Argentina are subject to collective bargaining agreements that govern general salary and compensation matters, basic benefits and hours of work. Equifax is not a party to these agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good. Information regarding our officers is included in Executive Officers of the Registrant below.

ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES Our executive offices are located at 1550 Peachtree Street, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia, in a leased facility that is also utilized by our Equifax North America and Equifax Latin America segments. Our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide. We consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet our current operating requirements, and most of the space is being utilized. We ordinarily lease office space for conducting our business and are obligated under approximately 81 leases and other rental arrangements for our headquarters and field locations. We own four office buildings. One is located in Wexford, Ireland and is utilized by Equifax Europe. One each, utilized by Equifax Latin America, is located in Sao Paulo, Brazil and in Santiago, Chile. A fourth located in Buenos Aires, Argentina was purchased in 2001 for use by Equifax Latin America but never occupied, and is now held for sale or lease. We also own approximately 23.5 acres in Windward Office Park located in Alpharetta, Georgia, adjacent to office space we currently lease. See Note 11 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our obligations under leases. We believe that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate our future needs.
ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In November2001, the landlord of our former headquarters facility brought an action, 1600 Peachtree, L.L.C. v. EquifaxInc., against us in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, which asserted claims related to our guaranty obligations under our lease termination agreement. This lawsuit seeks damages, of approximately $28.0million, substantially all of which represents future rent contingencies, and punitive damages. On motions for summary judgment, the Superior Court ruled against our discharge defense and against plaintiffs fraud claim. On June29, 2004, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Courts rulings. Both parties appealed these rulings to the Georgia Supreme Court, which on September27, 2004 declined to hear the appeals. The remaining issues in the case will now be tried in Superior Court. Trial is set to commence on May4, 2005. We intend to continue to contest in the Superior Court the damages claimed by the plaintiff.
In the third quarter of 2003, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issued Notices of Reassessment asserting that Acrofax,Inc., a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Equifax, is liable for additional tax for the 1995 through 2000 tax years, related to certain intercompany capital contributions and loans. In 1995, Acrofax invested U.K. 30 million pounds in Luxembourg S.A., a Luxembourg subsidiary of Equifax (LUX), which subsequently lent that amount to Equifax PLC, a U.K. subsidiary of Equifax. In June2000, Acrofax distributed via dividend shares of LUX to Equifax Credit Information Services, Inc., another subsidiary of Equifax. The CRA claimed that (1)by using LUX as an intermediary, Acrofax avoided paying tax on interest earned on the loan to Equifax PLC and is therefore taxable on the dividends it received from LUX; and (2)in the alternative, the transactions should be recharacterized as a loan directly from Acrofax to Equifax PLC and tax should be paid by Acrofax on the amount of interest income 13 that it would have received from such a loan as well as withholding tax on the loan principal. The additional tax sought by the CRA for these periods ranges, based on alternative theories, from $7.1million to $15.8million, plus interest and penalties. Acrofax has filed Notices of Objection in response to the Notices of Reassessment. On September2, 2003, we made a statutorily-required deposit of $5.7 million against the CRAs primary assessment theory. We intend to vigorously contest these reassessments and do not believe we have violated any statutory provision or rule.
On December30, 2003, Equifax and Naviant served a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that the shareholder sellers of Naviant had breached various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant in 2002. The arbitration demand seeks rescission of our Naviant purchase and the recovery of the purchase price or, in the alternative, recovery of monetary damages on various grounds. On March22, 2004, we recommenced our demand for arbitration in order to utilize the procedures of the American Arbitration Association. Some of the respondents have answered and denied liability. The arbitration has been stayed by agreement pending determination of the motions noted in the litigation described in the next paragraph. We cannot at this time predict the probable outcome of this matter.
On April28, 2004, in a case captioned Softbank Capital Partners LP, et al. v. Equifax Inc. and Naviant,Inc., certain of the former shareholders of Naviant filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking declaratory relief to prevent Equifax and Naviant from proceeding with the arbitration discussed in the the preceding paragraph, except for claims asserted against Softbank Capital Partners LP, as Shareholders Representative, for certain indemnified losses capped at the amount of a $10.0 million escrow fund specified in the agreement pursuant to which Equifax acquired Naviant. The parties are awaiting rulings on the issues presented by the motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiffs and the motion to dismiss filed by Equifax and Naviant. Although Equifax believes it and Naviant have substantial factual and legal defenses to plaintiffs claims, we cannot at this time predict the probable outcome of this matter.
On August13, 2004, in a case captioned Equifax Inc. v. Austin Ventures VIII, L.P., et al., Equifax filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to preserve its claims against the shareholder sellers of Naviant pending the arbitration proceeding described above.
We are involved in other lawsuits, claims and proceedings as is normal in the ordinary course of our business. Any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position, either individually or in the aggregate. However, our evaluation of the likely impact of these pending lawsuits could change in the future.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes in PartII, Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements, above, and Risk Factors, below, for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
All references to earnings per share data in this MD&A are to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.
Executive Overview Equifaxs Strategic Plan Our strategic plan for the Equifax franchise is based on three essential elementsa comprehensive information database, analytical resources to transform information into value-added insight for customers, and technology platforms that deliver the valuable answers to customers according to their needs.
Equifax collects, organizes and manages numerous types of credit, financial, public record, demographic and marketing information regarding individuals and businesses. This information originates from a variety of sources including financial or credit granting institutions, which provide loan and accounts receivable information; governmental entities, which provide public records of bankruptcies, liens and judgments; and consumers, who participate in surveys and submit warranty registration cards from which we gather demographic and marketing information. Our proprietary databases contain information on approximately 400 million consumers and businesses worldwide. The original data is compiled and processed utilizing our proprietary software and systems and distributed to customers in a variety of 18 user-friendly and value-add formats. Our products and services include consumer credit information, information database management, marketing information, small business credit information, decisioning and analytical tools, and identity verification services which enable businesses to make informed decisions about extending credit or service, manage portfolio risk and develop strategies for marketing to consumers and small businesses. We also enable consumers to manage and protect their financial affairs through a portfolio of products that we sell directly via the Internet and in various hard-copy formats.
We currently operate in 12 countries: North America (the U.S. and Canada), Europe (the U.K., Ireland, Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Peru and Uruguay). We serve customers across a wide range of industries, including the financial services, retail, telecommunications, utilities, automotive, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. Our revenue stream is highly diversified with our largest customer providing less than 2% of total revenues. Our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors, such as demand for, and price of, our services, technological competitiveness, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, federal, state, foreign and regulatory requirements governing privacy and use of data, and general economic conditions.
Since the early 1990s, Equifax has developed analytical tools for customers to use in their consumer oriented decisioning activities. These decisioning activities include numerous types of consumer interactions including customer acquisition, relationship management, e.g., up-selling and cross-selling and risk management.
Our enabling technologies include products such as Apply, Decision Power, ID Authentication and InterConnect. These platforms are developed in an Application Service Provider (ASP) format to allow for ease of integration into customers inhouse technology systems and to leverage Equifaxs extensive technological systems and communication networks.
We manage our business and report our financial results through the following three reportable segments:  Equifax North America  Equifax Europe  Equifax Latin America The North American reportable segment is made up of three operating segments:  Information Services  Marketing Services  Personal Solutions (formerly referred to as Consumer Direct) The Europe and Latin America reportable segments are made up of varying mixes of three product lines: Information Services, Marketing Services and Personal Solutions. Detailed financial results and segment information are provided in PartI, Item 1, Financial StatementsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note15, Segment Information.
Information Services revenues are principally transaction related, and are derived from our sales of the following products, many of which are delivered electronically: credit reporting and scoring, mortgage reporting, identity verification, fraud detection and modeling services, and certain of our decisioning products that facilitate pre-approved offers of credit that automate a variety of decisions. Revenues from our Marketing Services are derived from our sales of products that help customers acquire new customers. Personal Solutions revenues are transaction related, and are derived from our sales of credit reporting 19 products and identity theft monitoring services, which we deliver to consumers electronically via the Internet and via mail.
We see significant opportunities for growth through our ability to identify and enhance our customers decisioning intelligence to more effectively interact with, and serve, their customers; broadening our Personal Solutions offerings to consumers; and ultimately moving our own businesses further up the value chain from data to analytics and decisioning technologythe main driver of growth and differentiation in our North American business units.
Our corporate strategy as discussed above, is being executed in each of our business segments, providing our customers the ability to make decisions about their customers in real-time at the point of interaction.
Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These indicators include measurements of revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share, capital expenditures and cash flow. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as Equifaxs corporate governance practices, is used to ensure that business vitality is maintained and effective control is exercised.

20 NON-GAAP Performance Highlights (See Exhibit 99.1 for a reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures):  Consolidated revenueexcluding mortgage-related and eMarketing revenue was $1,052.8 million, up 10%;  Free cash flow was $261.5 million, up 9%; and  Earnings per share from continuing operationsexcluding sale of investment, asset impairment and related charges were $1.62, up 9%.
Overview Notes:  Consolidated revenue grew 5% for the year ended December31, 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to growth in North American Information Services, Personal Solutions, Europe and Latin America more than offsetting the decrease in Marketing Services revenue.
In North America Information Services, our largest operating segment, growth was driven in our U.S. Consumer and Commercial information business primarily in services provided to financial services, telecommunications and utility customers and Small Business Services.
Consolidated operating income increased 20%, or $61.6 million, to $375.8 million.
North America operating income improved 20%, or $64.8 million, to $389.1 million;  Europe operating income increased 31%, or $7.1 million, to $30.0 million; and  Latin America operating income decreased 15%, or $3.0 million, to $17.0 million.
Our Marketing Services businesses improved operating profit through improved expense control compared to 2003.
We began the initial phase-in of consumer eligibility for a free annual credit report, upon request, on December1, 2004. See PartI, Item 1, Business, Current Developments, FACT Act of 2003.

North America operating income for 2004, improved $64.8 million, or 20%, compared to 2003 due primarily to cost containment in our Marketing Services businesses as a result of our December2003 restructuring. Operating income in Europe improved $7.1 million, or 31%, due primarily to revenue growth in our U.K. businesses. Operating income in Latin America decreased $3.0 million, or 15%, driven primarily by increased data costs in our Brazilian operations.
Equifax North America Information Services U.S. Consumer and Commercial Services revenues for 2004 increased by $15.3 million, or 3%, when compared to 2003 due to increased sales for our small business services products and increased sales to our customers in the financial services, utilities and telecommunications industries slightly offset by decreased sales of mortgage-related products. In our Consumer Information business, volume increased 20%.
22 Average price per unit was lower due to a shift in industry mix of volume from our mortgage-related products to financial services, utilities and telecommunications. Mortgage Services revenue increased 5% for the year ended December31, 2004, when compared to 2003, counter to the prevailing trends in the mortgage marketplace primarily due to our ability to attract new customers and increase our market share. Canadian operations increased $8.1 million or 9%; excluding the favorable impact of currency, revenue was up only slightly when compared to 2003. Operating income for 2004 was $299.5 million for Information Services, an increase of $2.6 million or 1%. The increase in operating income is primarily the result of increased revenue slightly offsetting increased costs in correlation to increased volume in our financial services, utilities and telecommunications vertical lines of business.
Marketing Services Credit Marketing Services revenues for 2004 decreased $10.3 million, or 7%, compared to 2003. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to net volume decreases. Direct Marketing Services revenues decreased by $19.3 million, or 17%, with reduced eMarketing revenue from volume decreases being the primary cause of the decrease, partially offset by increases in our traditional mail products when 2004 is compared to 2003. Marketing Services operating income for 2004 was $74.4 million, an increase of $25.6 million, or 52%, resulting from the elimination of eMarketing operating losses as a result of our December2003 eMarketing restructuring. In the second quarter of 2004, we determined that continued difficulties with our eMarketing operations indicated that certain remaining assets may not be recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of $2.4 million. See note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Personal Solutions Personal Solutions revenues for 2004 increased $26.6 million, or 38%, compared to 2003 due to increased volume. Personal Solutions operating income was $17.6 million, an increase of $8.4 million, or 91%.
Equifax Europe Equifax Europe continued to improve its profit and operating margins through increased revenue, expense reductions and operating efficiencies. Positive performance in our consumer line resulted in improved profit in the U.K. In June 2004, after incurring losses in each of the last four years, we determined that certain long-lived assets in the Italian business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million. In October2004 we sold our Italian businesses and have reclassified the year-to-date results of Italy in discontinued operations. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equifax Europe revenues increased from $115.8 million in 2003 to $142.0 million in 2004, including favorable currency impact of $14.9 million. Operating income for 2004 increased $7.1 million, or 31%, when compared to a year ago. The improvement in operating income was driven by increased volume, expense reductions, operating efficiencies and the impact of foreign currency.
Equifax Latin America Revenues of our Equifax Latin America segment increased 14% to $91.5 million in 2004. Local currency fluctuation against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our Latin America revenues by $4.4 million.
Operating income decreased to $17.0 million 2004, compared to $20.0 million 2003. This decrease was primarily the result of slower revenue growth and increased data-related costs in our Brazilian operations. Equifax Latin America profit margin was 19% for the year ended December31, 2004, versus 25% for 2003.
23 General Corporate Our general corporate expenses are expenses that are incurred at the corporate level and have no clear relationship in their support of our business units, and ultimately the reportable segments. These expenses include shared services and administrative and legal expenses. General corporate expense was $60.3 million for 2004, compared to $53.0 million for 2003. This increase was primarily driven by increased benefits costs and professional fees. Our total costs incurred to comply with our annual review of internal control over financial reporting as required by Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were in excess of $5.0million. A substantial portion of our increased professional fees was approximately $3.7 million in total fees incurred to our independent auditor for all services provided, an increase of 162% compared to 2003.
Other Income Other income increased $33.5 million primarily due to our sale of our investment in Intersections Inc. on May5, 2004. See Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Overview Notes:  Consolidated revenue grew 11% for the year ended December31, 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to growth in North American Information Services and Personal Solutions.
In North America Information Services, our largest operating segment, growth in our U.S. Consumer and Commercial information business was primarily in services provided to financial services, telecommunications and utility customers and growth in Mortgage Services due to higher refinancing volumes when compared to 2002.
24  Our Marketing Services business was restructured in December2003 when we recorded charges related with asset impairments and restructuring of our eMarketing business.

Consolidated operating margin for 2003 was 26% compared to 32% for the prior year with total costs and expenses as a percent of total revenue increasing to 74% from 68% the prior year. The primary causes for the increase in operating expenses in 2003 were increased eMarketing Services operating expenses, the December2003 eMarketing asset impairment and related charges.
North America operating profit for 2003, declined $37.3 million, or 10%, compared to 2002 due primarily to increased eMarketing Services operating expenses, the December2003 eMarketing asset impairment and related charges. Operating profit in Europe improved $9.0 million, or 65%, due primarily to expense reductions and operating efficiencies. Operating profit in Latin America was relatively flat compared to 2002.
Equifax North America Information Services U.S. Consumer and Commercial Services revenues for 2003 increased by $61.9 million, or 14%, when compared to 2002 due to higher volumes and market share primarily from our financial services and telecommunications customers. For 2003, in our Consumer Information business, volume increased 18% while the average price per unit decreased 9%. Average price per unit was driven by mix, volume from higher tiered unit pricing and new customers. Mortgage Services revenue increased 30% for the year ended December31, 2003, when compared to 2002. Mortgage refinancing slowed down in the second half of 2003 as mortgage interest rates rose from their 40 year low. Canadian operations increased $13.5 million or 17%; excluding the favorable impact of currency, revenue was up 5% when compared to 2002. Operating income for 2003 was $296.9 million for Information Services, an increase of $29.7 million or 11%. The increase in operating income is primarily the result of increased revenue offsetting increased costs in correlation to increased volume in our financial services, utilities and telecommunications vertical lines of business.
Marketing Services Credit Marketing Services revenues for 2003 decreased $14.5 million, or 9%, compared to 2002. The year-over-year comparison is primarily due to net volume decreases. Direct Marketing Services revenues increased by $5.4 million, or 5%, with the eMarketing portion being flat when 2003 is compared to 2002. 2003 provided challenges in our Direct Marketing Services businesses, especially as the regulatory environment surrounding the business was in lengthy transition. As discussed above, we have restructured our eMarketing business and consolidated its operations into Direct Marketing Services.
26 Marketing Services operating income for 2003, net of $30.6 million in asset impairment and related charges, was $18.2 million, a decrease of $67.2 million. In the second quarter of 2003 in our eMarketing business, $4.3 million in purchased data that was determined to be of no value and $4.2 million in receivables that were determined to be uncollectible were written off. We severed our relationship with those members responsible for these write-offs. In the fourth quarter of 2003, to bring eMarketing costs in line with eMarketing revenue, we recorded $30.6 million in asset impairments and related charges to complete the consolidation of eMarketing services into Direct Marketing Services. These asset write-downs, personnel reductions and facility consolidations provided a more efficient operating structure for 2004.
Personal Solutions Personal Solutions revenues for 2003 increased $30.1 million, or 76%, compared to 2002 due to increased volume. Personal Solutions operating income was $9.2 million, an increase of $0.2 million.
Equifax Europe Equifax Europe, which includes the results of our operations in the U.K., Spain and Portugal, and our support operations in Ireland, continued to improve its profit and operating margins through expense reductions and operating efficiencies. Revenues increased from $112.1 million to $115.8 million, including a favorable currency impact of $13.2 million. Our U.K. operations generated 88% of Equifax Europes revenues in 2003.
Operating expenses in 2003 of $92.9 million declined 5%. U.K. expenses were flat for 2003, driven by our 2002 restructuring plan focused on rationalizing our U.K. operations and productivity. The commercial business in Spain has been held for sale since the third quarter of 2002. We were negotiating with a new prospective buyer at the end of 2003. We wrote down the carrying value of the discontinued operation an additional $2.8 million to reflect the impact of the current offer. Operating income of $22.9 million increased 65% over 2002 driven by U.K. expense reductions. We continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies in our European businesses and expected continued margin improvement in 2004.
Equifax Latin America Revenues of our Equifax Latin America segment, which includes results of our operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and El Salvador, operated in an environment of economic stabilization and increased 4% to $79.9 million. Currency devaluation negatively impacted our Latin America revenues by $3.0 million, of which Brazil accounted for $2.3 million. Brazils revenues grew 6% in 2003 driven by performance in commercial reporting services.
Operating income stayed flat at $20.0 million compared to 2002. Equifax Latin America delivered solid operating margins of 25% in 2003 versus 26% in 2002.
General Corporate Our general corporate expenses are expenses that are incurred at the corporate level and have no clear relationship in their support of our business units, and ultimately the reportable segments. Included are shared services and administrative and legal expenses. General corporate expense increased $5.3 million in 2003 primarily due to higher compensation expense from salaries absorbed due to the repatriation of our previously outsourced accounting operations and human resources center.
Consolidated Outlook for 2005 Looking forward, we believe that the performance of our business units in 2004 positions our company well for 2005.
27 During 2005 we expect:  Modest improvement in the U.S. economy. The rate at which the economy grows is one of the key indicators of financial condition and operating performance for our company. As the economy improves, the need for our services also increases. However, if the economy does not improve as forecasted, we expect low interest rates to sustain demand in mortgage-related activity and to offset slower growth in our other markets.
U.S. Consumer and Commercial Services will continue its solid performance. Revenue growth was 3% in 2004 and 14% in 2003. Unit growth was 20% in 2004 and 18% in 2003. Based on our ability to develop new business, we expect current trends to continue and that revenue and unit growth will be sustainable for 2005, and favorable when compared to 2004.
Marketing Services performance will depend greatly on the overall U.S. economy. Year over year declines in revenue over the last two years reflects declining overall customer demand for these types of services. Assuming an improvement in the overall U.S. economy, however, we expect revenue to grow in 2005 compared to 2004. New leadership and implementation of our new Accel technology platform will support revenue growth and additional expense reductions in 2005.
Personal Solutions will continue to grow, aided by consumers increased focus on fiscal responsibility and identity theft. As the FACT Act is fully implemented in 2005, consumer awareness regarding fiscal responsibility and identity theft should increase. We have significant opportunities to market additional Personal Solutions products and services to consumers. Additionally, we continue to observe positive trends in customers renewing subscriptions and ordering additional products and services.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by our operating activities, our revolving credit and asset securitization facilities and cash and cash equivalents on hand.
Our ability to generate cash from operations is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We use cash flows from operations, along with borrowings, to fund our capital expenditures and growth initiatives, make acquisitions, retire outstanding indebtedness, pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of our common stock.
Cash from Operations For the twelve months ended December31, 2004, we generated $309.0 million of cash flow from operating activities compared to $293.7million for the twelve months ended December31, 2003. The major source of cash flow for 2004 was net income of $234.7million, net of $81.1million for depreciation and amortization offset by our gain on the sale of our investment in Intersections Inc. of $36.8million. Total working capital, excluding debt, at December31, 2004 was $98.4 million and at December31, 2003 was $91.6 million.
Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was $293.7 million compared to $249.6 million in 2002. The major source of cash flow for 2003 was net income of $164.9 million, net of loss from discontinued operations of $15.8 million, asset impairment and restructuring charges of $30.6 million and $94.1 million for depreciation and amortization.
28 Investing Activities Investing activities for 2004 and 2003 used cash of $6.5million and $98.8million, respectively. Capital expenditures used cash in the amounts of $47.5million and $52.7million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing technology platforms, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, the licensing of software applications and investing in disaster recovery systems. In 2004, FACT Act-related capital expenditures totaled $9.2 million. In 2005, we expect to use $1.0 million to complete our FACT Act-related capital expenditures. We expect to use $60.0 million$70.0 million for capital expenditures in 2005.
In addition to capital expenditures, we used cash of $17.4million and $40.7million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, for acquisitions. We acquired the credit files, contractual rights to territories, customer relationships and related businesses of two credit reporting agencies in the U.S. and one in Canada, for $17.4 million in cash. During 2003, we acquired consumer credit files, contractual rights to territories and customer relationships and related businesses from four affiliates in the U.S. and one in Canada and a small email marketing business for $41.0million in cash and $1.9 million in liabilities.
In 2003, net cash used in investing activities totaled $98.8 million, a decrease of $241.8 million compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily a result of our 2002 acquisition of Naviant and acquisition of assets from CBC. Our acquisitions, net of cash acquired, accounted for $321.2 million of total cash invested in 2002. Capital expenditures exclusive of acquisitions totaled $52.7 million and $55.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, which principally represented development associated with key technology platforms in our businesses.
In the third quarter of 2002, our $41.0 million note receivable associated with the sale of our risk management collections business in 2000 was completely paid.
Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities during 2004 totaled $289.0 million, compared with net cash used by financing activities during 2003 that totaled $195.3 million and net cash provided by financing activities during 2002 that totaled $92.6 million.
Net payments for short-term debt were $145.5 million and payments on our long-term debt were $15.6 million during 2004. In addition, we used $138.0 million during 2004 for the purchase of 5,393,610 shares of our common stock at an average price of $25.55. We increased our dividend on common shares outstanding from $0.02 per share to $0.03 per share during the second quarter of 2004. We paid cash dividends of $15.0 million for 2004. We received cash of $28.1 million during 2004 for the exercise of stock options. In addition to the shares remaining from our Board of Directors previous authorization in February2002, the Board authorized an additional $250.0 million in share repurchases in August2004. At December31, 2004, our remaining authorized share repurchase was approximately $239.3 million. We continue to expect to purchase our own common stock. During 2005, we expect to retire our 6.3% notes by utilizing our cash flow from operations, excess cash on our balance sheet and borrowings under our U.S. senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and asset securitization facility.
In 2003, net payments for short-term debt were $16.0 million. Additions to our long-term debt were $113.4 million and payments on our long-term debt were $202.6 million during 2003. We increased the amount outstanding under our credit facility in 2003 for purposes of retiring the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.5% senior notes that matured in June,2003. In addition, we used $94.9 million during 2003 for the purchase of 4,174,800 shares of our common stock at an average price of $22.74. Our dividend policy remained consistent; we paid cash dividends of $11.3 million in 2003. We received cash of $19.5 million during 2003 for the exercise of stock options. At December31, 2003, our remaining authorized share repurchase was approximately $127.3 million.
29 In 2002, we received $249.5 million in proceeds from the sale of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.95% senior unsecured notes, which mature November1, 2007. During 2002 we invested $79.8 million to repurchase 2,939,300 million shares of our common stock, and received $34.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. At December31, 2001, our remaining authorization for share repurchases was approximately $45.0 million, and in February2002, our Board of Directors approved an additional $250.0 million for share repurchases. We also paid dividends of $11.4 million in 2002.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $52.1 million and $38.1 million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Revolving Credit Facilities In August2004, we entered into a new five-year, $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement. The new facility provides for a variable interest rate tied to a Base Rate, the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a specified margin or competitive bid options similar to those contained in the previous facility. The new facility replaces a $465.0 million revolving credit facility. Under our senior credit agreement, we must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 (raised to 3.25 to 1.0 for four fiscal quarters in the event the CSC Put option described below under Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments is exercised) and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 4.0 to 1.0.Compliance with these financial covenants is tested quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis. The non-financial covenants include limitations on liens, subsidiary debt, mergers, liquidations, asset dispositions and acquisitions. Our borrowings under this facility, which have not been guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries, are unsecured and will rank on parity in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. As of December31, 2004, $500.0 million was available and there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. As of December31, 2004, we were in compliance with our covenants under this senior revolving credit agreement.
In September2004, we entered into a new trade receivables-backed revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax may borrow up to $125.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability and other terms and conditions. Equifax will use the net proceeds received from the sale of its trade receivables to the subsidiary for general corporate purposes. The credit facility has an expiration date of September6, 2005, but may be extended for an additional period of up to three years if specified conditions are satisfied. Loans will bear interest based at commercial paper rates, LIBOR or Base Rate plus a specified margin. Outstanding debt under the facility will be consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes. As of December31, 2004, $84.0 million was available and no amounts were outstanding under this facility.
One of our Canadian subsidiaries had an unsecured, 364-day C$100.0 million revolving credit facility that expired on September30, 2004. The agreement provided for borrowings tied to the Prime Rate, Base Rate, LIBOR or Canadian Bankers Acceptances, and contains financial covenants related to interest coverage, funded debt to cash flow and limitations on subsidiary indebtedness. We guaranteed the indebtedness of our Canadian subsidiary under this credit facility. The bank agreed to carry the amounts outstanding under the facility on a demand basis following the expiration of the revolver on September30, 2004, and the remaining balance was paid in October2004. Borrowings under this loan (which are included in 2003 short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Financial Statements) at December31, 2003 were $15.4 million.
In November2004, we entered into a C$25.0 million revolving credit facility that replaced the C$100.0 million facility that expired in September2004. The C$25.0 million facility expires in September2005. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December31, 2004.
30 At February17, 2005, our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings were A- by Standard& Poors and Baa1 by Moodys.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December31, 2004: Paymentsdueby Total Lessthan1year 1to3years 3to5years Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (Note 7) $ 654.2 $ 255.7 $ 249.7 $  $ 148.8 Operating leases   (Note 11) 107.9 14.6 19.9 61.2 12.2 Data processing agreement obligations (Note 11) 389.4 70.8 95.6 82.6 140.4 Other long-term   liabilities 129.8  29.1 38.0 62.7 Interest expense 286.2 30.6 43.4 20.7 191.5 $ 1,567.5 $ 371.7 $437.7 $202.5 $555.6 We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash and cash equivalent balances and access to committed and uncommitted credit facilities and the capital market, if required, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next 12 months, and the foreseeable future thereafter, although any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. A potential extraordinary use of cash would be the option that Computer Science Corporation (CSC) can exercise to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013. The option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if CSC were to exercise the option today, the option price would be approximately $650.0 to $700.0 million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business, current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. If CSC were to exercise its option, we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank credit and the issuance of public debt or equity financings. However, the availability and terms of any such financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the condition of the equity markets, general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition. Because we do not control the timing of CSCs exercise of its option, we could be required to seek such financing and increase our indebtedness at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable.
We continue to evaluate our ability to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities from lenders and restructure our long-term debt for strategic reasons, or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Off Balance Sheet Transactions Other than facility leasing arrangements, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. We have entered into a synthetic lease on our Atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to provide us with favorable financing terms with regard to this facility. This $29.0 million lease was entered into in 1998 and expires in 2010. Total lease payments for the remaining term total $9.7 million. Under this synthetic lease arrangement, we have also guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the 31 lessor. In the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term, we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds, up to a maximum amount of $23.2 million, which equals 80% of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term. Based on a current appraisal of the property, we determined that its fair value is $25.0 million. The $4.0 million shortfall against the residual value guarantee will be subsequently recognized as an expense ratably over the remaining lease term.
Letters of Credit and Guarantees We will, from time to time, issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of our business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is less than $8.0 million. We provide these guarantees from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. Except for our guarantee of the synthetic lease referred to above, our only outstanding guarantee that is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheets was extended in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to RMA Holdings, LLC (RMA) in October2000, at which time we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with RMA. The operating lease, which expires December11, 2011, has a remaining balance of $8.4 million based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments at December31, 2004. Our obligations under such guarantee are not secured. We believe the likelihood of demand for payment under this instrument is minimal and expect no material losses to occur in connection with this guarantee.
Subsidiary Funds Transfer Limitations The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds is limited in some cases by foreign government regulations. At December31, 2004, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries was not material.
Pension Plans Our defined benefit plan at December 31, 2004, the U.S. Retirement Income Plan (USRIP), is subject to the minimum funding requirements and maximum tax-deductible contribution limitations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). We made discretionary cash contributions to the USRIP of $20.0 million in each of 2003 and 2004.
We reduced the discount rate assumption used to measure the projected pension and postretirement benefit obligations from 6.25% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 5.92% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to a change in the methodology used to determine the rate and a decline in the level of long term interest rates. This reduction caused the projected benefit obligation to increase $23.8 million, from $453.5 million at December 31, 2003 to $477.3 million at December 31, 2004. At December31, 2004, the USRIP was unfunded with respect to its accumulated benefit obligation by $23.0 million as determined by SFAS No.87 Employers Accounting for Pensions.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long-term investment gain on those assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was 8.75% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 and will be 8.00% for the USRIP and 8.25% for the EIPP (defined below) for purposes of calculating SFAS No. 87 expense for 2005.
Effective January 1, 2005, we separated the USRIP into two separate ERISA defined benefits plans. The new plan, the Equifax Inc. Pension Plan (EIPP), was funded in January 2005, with a $20.0 million cash contribution from Equifax and the transfer of $17.0 million of assets from the USRIP to the EIPP. The EIPP contained all active employee participants of Equifax as of January1, 2005, and the USRIP contained all inactive vested participants as of that date. Inactive participants constituted approximately 85% of total participants prior to the separation. The benefits of participants in both plans were unaffected by the separation. The two groups of Equifax, participants - active and inactive - had projected patterns of 32 actuarial liabilities which were markedly different, due to the demographic differences between the two populations. The two plans will have separate assumed rates of return and separate asset allocation strategies, which will allow the corporation to more efficiently fund its respective pension liabilities. Additionally, the assets of one plan will not be available to fund the liabilities of the other plan. We expect to maintain essentially the same funding policy as was the case prior to the separation of the pension plans.
For our non-U.S. retirement tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations.
For the non-qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits to retired participants when payable to them but accrue the associated expense and assume the liabilities as required by GAAP accounting.
Acquisition of APPRO Systems,Inc.
Equifax financed the $92.0 million purchase price relating to the acquisition of APPRO Systems,Inc., through available cash and approximately $72.0 million in borrowings under its existing trade-receivables backed revolving credit facility. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16.
CEO Transition On August18, 2004, Equifax Inc. announced that Thomas F. Chapman, chairman and chief executive officer, informed the Board of Directors of his decision to retire after a successor is elected and the transition completed. The Board requested that Mr.Chapman remain through 2005 or such earlier period of time as would be necessary to ensure an orderly transition. On December20, 2004, Equifax entered into a transition retirement agreement with Mr.Chapman for this purpose.
Other We have an outstanding tax related matter with a Canadian tax authority. During 2003, we deposited $5.7 million representing a portion of one of the reassessment positions. It is the opinion of our outside legal and tax experts that we will prevail. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information.
Inflation We do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation could adversely affect our future operating results if it were to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No.00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No.00-21 provides guidance pertaining to the revenue recognition methodology to apply to revenue arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No.00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. We adopted EITF Issue No.00-21 on July1, 2003 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
33 In December2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to SFASNo.132 Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The purpose of the revision is to require additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. These additional disclosures include information describing the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurements date(s), plan obligations, cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized. As revised, SFAS132 enhances disclosures by providing more relevant information about the plan assets available to finance benefit payments, the obligation to pay benefits and an entitys obligation to fund the plan. This revised version of SFAS132 is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2003. We adopted the revisions to SFAS132 and have included the additional disclosures in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December2003, the FASB issued its revision to FASB Interpretation No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (an Interpretation of ARB No.51). FIN 46 addresses the consolidation by a reporting entity of variable interest entities that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or in which the equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Application of FIN 46 is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities (also referred to as special-purpose entities) for periods ending after December15, 2003. The FASB subsequently issued FASB Staff Positions (FSPs), which deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests in certain variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before February1, 2003 until the end of the first interim period ending after March15, 2004. These FSPs also required certain disclosures about variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities. We adopted the provisions of FIN 46 in March2004 and it has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104, or SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple-element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the SECs related Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104, which was effective upon issuance. We implemented SAB 104 in December2003 and it did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In May2004, the FASB issued FSP No.106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. This staff position supersedes FSP No.106-1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 by clarifying the guidance on the recognition of the effects of the Act on employers accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Employers that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that provides prescription benefits that are deemed actuarially equivalent to the Medicare PartD benefit are eligible for a federal subsidy. This subsidy is to be treated as an actuarial experience gain in the calculation of the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. FSP 106-2 is effective for the first interim period or annual period beginning after June15, 2004. We adopted the accounting and disclosure provisions of FSP 106-2 in July2004 and it did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In July2004, the EITF of the FASB reached consensus on Issue No.02-14 Whether the Equity Method of Accounting Applies When an Investor Does Not Have an Investment in Voting Stock of an 34 Investee but Exercises Significant Influence through Other Means. EITF Issue No.02-14 provides guidance pertaining to an investors accounting when the investor has significant influence over an investee through means other than voting stock. The provisions of EITF No.02-14 apply to reporting periods beginning after September15, 2004. The Companys accounting for such investments has been consistent with EITF02-14 and its adoption during the fourth quarter of 2004 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo. 123R Share-Based Payments. SFAS123R is a revision to SFAS123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS123R establishes standards for the accounting for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services from either employees or non-employees. This financial accounting standard requires the cost resulting from share-based payment transactions be recognized in the entitys financial statements as the goods are received or the services are rendered, and establishes fair value as the measurement objective for the accounting for such transactions. SFAS123R is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June15, 2005 and applies to (a) all new awards granted after June15, 2005; (b) modifications, repurchases or cancellations occurring after June15, 2005, but pertaining to awards granted before June15, 2005; and (c) the unvested service component of outstanding awards granted prior to June15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS123R in our third quarter beginning July 1, 2005 and expect that its impact on our financial position or results of operations will be in the range of our SFAS123 pro forma amounts disclosed in Note 1 of our Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS153 Exchanges of Non monetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No.29. SFAS153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the fair value measurement principal exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to significantly change as result of the exchange. SFAS153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS153 in July2005 and do not expect that it will a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December2004, the FASB issued FSP No.109-2 Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). FSP109-2 specifically addresses the one-time tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the U.S. In accordance with this FSP, an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period covering the enactment of the Act, to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS109. FSP109-2 requires the following disclosures for an enterprise that has not completed its evaluation of the repatriation provisions: (a)a summary of the repatriation as it applies to the enterprise; (b)the expected completion date of the evaluation; (c)the expected effect on income tax expense or benefit; and (d)the amount of un-remitted earnings being considered for repatriation. FSP 109-2 is effective upon issuance. We are utilizing the time allowed by FSP 109-2 to evaluate the effect of the Act as it pertains to our foreign earnings and our application of SFAS109, and have included the requisite disclosures in Notes 2 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because 35 they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information see Item 8 of PartII, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, for which the corresponding products have been delivered or services have rendered, the pricing of which is either fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee arrangement is reasonably assured. Our sales are predicated upon the existence of a signed contract or purchase order which provides persuasive evidence of the arrangement, pertinent terms and conditions regarding products to be delivered or services to be rendered and the related pricing methodology. We consider the earnings process to be completed when we have fulfilled our specific obligations under the contract or purchase order as substantively demonstrated by evidence of product delivery or rendering of services. We consider the fee arrangement to be realizable or collectible when there exists a probable expectation of customer payment.
A significant portion of our revenues is based upon transactional activity generated by customers access to, or queries of, our propriety data bases. Product or service delivery, and customer acceptance is inherent in this process by nature of the value thereby transferred to and utilized by the customer. Revenues are typically usage based and incorporate predetermined volume-tiered unit pricing.
A small portion of our revenue is related to subscription-based contracts under which the customer pays a flat fee for a preset or unlimited volume of transactions or services. Revenue recognition in these cases is based upon pro-rating the related fee over the term of the contract. For pre-set volume contracts, if the actual periodic usage is more than the relative periodic prorated volume, the revenue related to the over-run is billed and recognized monthly; and if actual periodic usage is less than the relative periodic prorated volume, the revenue related to the under-run is deferred and recognized when cumulative volumes exceed the contracted volumes or at the end of the contract period.
In conjunction with certain products and services, we charge a non-refundable set-up, membership or right-to-use license fee which is recognized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
Revenue from, and customer billing for, the sale of complementary Information Service products such as the development of unique decision or predictive statistical models, and the sale of Marketing Service products such as demographic data lists, data queries and market research, is recognized upon completion, customer installation and acceptance.
For sales contracts having multiple elements that can be divided into separate units of accounting, we allocate revenue to these separate units based on their relative fair values. If relative fair values cannot be established, revenue recognition is deferred until all elements under the contract have been delivered. Multiple deliverable arrangements generally involve delivery of multiple product lines. These product lines are distinct enough to be separated into separate units of accounting. Each product line does not impact the value or usage of other deliverables in the arrangement, and each can be sold alone or purchased from 36 another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the remaining deliverables. Delivery of product lines generally occurs consistently over the contract period.
We consider revenue recognition to be critical to all of our operating segments due to the impact on our results of operations.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other accounts receivable, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on our past write-off experience (i.e. average percentage of receivables written off historically) and the length of time the receivables are past due. Allowances for doubtful accounts were approximately $9.3 million or 5% of the accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31, 2004. Accounts receivable, net of allowances, was approximately $195.1 million or 65% of total current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets of December31, 2004. We consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flow. If the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if economic conditions worsened, additional allowances may be required in the future, which could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts each period. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period, material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or expense recognized could result.
Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Goodwill and certain other intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS142, and all other long-lived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with SFASNo.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets (principally goodwill, purchased data files, systems development and other deferred costs and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries) may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include: changes in business strategy, market conditions or the manner of use of an asset; underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. In evaluating our long-lived assets other than goodwill for possible impairment, management estimates that assets future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life. While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations. In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS142, which among other things, eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated annually for impairment by applying a fair value-based test. We adopted the standard effective January1, 2002 for acquisitions prior to June30, 2001, and, in accordance with the standard, completed our first fair value-based impairment tests by June30, 2002. During 2004, we updated our impairment evaluation and determined that reporting unit goodwill remained unimpaired.
Legal Contingencies We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. Our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on our managements view of the expected outcome. We periodically review claims and legal proceedings 37 and assess whether we have potential financial exposure. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for estimated legal fees and settlements in accordance with SFASNo.5, Accounting for Contingencies.
Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFASNo.109, Accounting for Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning opportunities, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations. A valuation allowance is currently set against certain net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income or other tax planning opportunities. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected.
On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. Equifax may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations during its 2005 tax year. Equifax has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. Equifax expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $100.0 million. Due to complexity of the provisions of the AJCA and pending additional clarifying language, the range of possible income tax effects of potential repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Retirement Plans Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No.87 and SFASNo.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Our minimum pension liability, net of tax, as of December31, 2004, was approximately $117.0 million or 11% of the total liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2004. We consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because our management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, health care cost trends rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
38 Risk Factors Since our revenues depend to a large extent on our customers demand for consumer credit information, deterioration of current economic conditions or rising interest rates may harm our results of operations.
Consumer credit reports constitute our core product. In general, our customers use our credit reports and related services to process applications for new credit cards, automobile loans, home mortgages and refinancing and other consumer loans. They also use our credit reports and services to monitor existing credit relationships. Consumer demand for credit, i.e. rates of spending and levels of indebtedness, tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Rising rates of interest may also negatively impact consumer demand for credit, especially mortgage loan refinancing. A decline in consumer demand for credit reduces our customers demand for our consumer credit reports. Consequently, our revenues from consumer credit report products and services could be negatively affected and our results of operations harmed if consumer demand for credit decreases, or if interest rates increase.
The loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services.
We rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers and various government and public record services. Our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use. If a substantial number of data sources were to withdraw their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted, which could result in decreased revenues, net income and earnings per share.
Compliance with recent amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act will increase our compliance costs, which may not be offset by regulatory recovery fees and consumer marketing initiatives.
The FACT Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, became law in December2003. Beginning on December1, 2004, the FACT Act, among other things, requires us on an annual basis to provide free credit reports to consumers upon request. These reports may be requested by Internet, telephone or mail through centralized request facilities which we and other nationwide credit reporting agencies must establish and support. In addition, subject to final regulations to be adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers will be entitled to a free credit report upon request if a report results in the consumer obtaining credit terms less favorable than those provided to a majority of the credit providers customers (risk-based pricing). The FACT Act also requires us to provide credit scores to requesting consumers for a reasonable fee, as determined by the FTC. The FTC has issued regulations to implement many of these requirements, including establishment of the centralized request facilities and development of procedures to phase-in such requests, beginning in the Western region of the U.S. and expanding to include the Midwestern region on March1, 2005; the Southern region on June1, 2005; and the Eastern region on September1, 2005. Additional provisions of the FACT Act impose requirements designed to reduce consumer identity theft, limit provision of medical information and require reports to the FTC regarding consumer complaints.
We have modified our procedures and systems to deal with these and other FACT Act provisions where applicable. We have incurred significant compliance costs to implement the FACT Act requirements, and we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FTCs regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The net impact of the free report disclosure and other requirements of the FACT Act on our business will depend on numerous factors, including among others the actual demand of consumers for free credit reports, our ability to increase fees to customers to recover these regulatory costs, our experience marketing 39 fee-generating products to consumers requesting free credit file disclosures; the FTCs final determination of the fee we can charge for providing credit score disclosures to requesting consumers; the actual cost of resolving additional credit file and credit score reinvestigation requests from consumers; and approval of final FTC and Federal Reserve Board ruleson risk-based pricing transactions and other matters.
Changes in the legislative, regulatory and judicial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect, manage, aggregate and use data.
Our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions. Consequently, certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and Canada, and in those countries within Europe and Latin America where we do business. For instance, much of the data and services that we provide are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which regulates the use of consumer credit information and, to a lesser extent, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which regulates the use of non-public personal information held by financial institutions. We are also subject to the U.K.s Data Protection Act of 1998, which regulates the manner in which we can use third-party data and recent regulatory limitations relating to use of the Electoral Roll, one of our key data sources in the U.K. In addition, public interest in individual privacy rights and the collection, distribution and use of information about individuals may result in the adoption of new federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could include increased compliance requirements and restrictions on the purchase, sale and sharing of information about consumers for commercial purposes, and have a negative impact on our ability to collect such information provided by consumers voluntarily. Future international, federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection, management and use of data about individuals, and adverse publicity, judicial interpretations or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information, may result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense or a loss of revenue.
Our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share, or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our gross margins.
We operate in a number of geographic, product and service markets that are highly competitive. In consumer credit reporting services, we compete primarily with two global consumer credit reporting companies, Experian Information Solutions,Inc. and TransUnion LLC. We also compete with these and other companies, including Acxiom Corporation, Harte-Hanks,Inc. and InfoUSA,Inc. with respect to our direct marketing services. We cannot assure that competitors will not develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services.
The sizes of our competitors vary across market segments, as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target. Therefore, some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall. As a result, our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of products and services. Moreover, new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share. For instance, we may face competition from new entrants to the business and consumer marketing information industry as a result of the rapid expansion of the Internet, which is a substantial new channel for distributing consumer and business information to the market. If we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition, our ability to expand our business and sell our products and services will be negatively affected.
Some of our competitors may also be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data, technical superiority or economies of scale. Price reductions by our 40 competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations, and could also harm our ability to obtain new commercial relationships on favorable terms.
Our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services, and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services, our revenues may decline.
To increase our revenues, we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance. We believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer products and services. Products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development. We cannot assure that the marketplace will accept these products. If our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services, our ability to increase revenues will be impaired.
If we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies, our products and services could become less competitive or obsolete.
In our markets, technology changes rapidly, and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware, network operating systems, programming tools, programming languages, operating systems, database technology and the use of the Internet. Advances in technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and services and delivery formats. If we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, our products and services could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies; use leading third-party technologies effectively; continue to develop our technical expertise; anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs; and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes.
We may suffer adverse financial consequences if Computer Sciences Corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us.
In 1988, we entered into an agreement with CSC and certain of its affiliates under which CSCs credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services. Under the agreement, CSC has an option, exercisable at any time, to sell its credit reporting business to us. The option expires in 2013. The option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if CSC were to exercise the option today, the option price would be approximately $650.0 to $700.0million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the businesses, current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. Therefore, the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount. If CSC were to exercise its option, we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt and/or equity. However, the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the state of the equity markets, general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition. Because we do not control the timing of CSCs exercise of its option, we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable.
Our international operations subject us to additional business risks that may reduce our profitability or revenues.
We conduct business outside of the U.S. During the fiscal year ended December31, 2004, we received approximately 26% of our revenues from business outside the U.S. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the U.S. As a result, our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The risks and potential costs of our international operations, include: political and economic instability; changes in regulatory 41 requirements and policy and the adoption of laws detrimental to our operations, such as legislation relating to the collection and use of personal data; negative impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations; potentially adverse tax consequences; increased restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and general economic conditions in international markets. We may not be able to avoid significant expenditures in addressing these potential risks.
Security is important to our business, and breaches of security, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could harm our business.
Business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce, including that which is Internet-based, requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Several of our products are accessed through the Internet, including our consumer and commercial information services that are delivered via ePORT, our Internet delivery channel and our Personal Solutions services accessible through the www.equifax.com website. Security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services via ePORT, our Personal Solutions website or well-publicized security breaches not involving the Internet that may affect us or our industry, such as database intrusion, could be detrimental to our business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products, consumer services and proprietary database information.
If we experience system failures, the delivery of our products and services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted, which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers.
Our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers. Some of these systems have been outsourced to third party providers. Any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. Our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses. The steps we have taken to prevent a system failure may not be successful and our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.
We may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses.
We have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies. Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. Such risks include:  the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined business may not be achieved;  the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth;  unexpected liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses;  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;  the potential disruption of our ongoing business;  the potential dilution of our existing stockholders and earnings per share;  unanticipated liabilities, legal risks and costs;  the distraction of management from our ongoing business; and  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel.
42 These factors could harm our business, results of operations or financial position, particularly in the event of a significant acquisition. The acquisition of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our relative exposure to the risks of conducting operations in international markets.
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risk, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates, that could impact our results of operations and financial position. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge certain of these exposures. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk A substantial majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in U.S.dollars. However, we do transact business in other currencies, primarily the British pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. For most of these foreign currencies, we are a net recipient, and therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business.
We are required to translate, or express in U.S. dollars, the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year-end rate of exchange on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year. We record the resulting translation adjustment, and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, as components of our shareholders equity. Other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We do not, as a matter of policy, hedge translational foreign currency exposure. We will, however, hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency.
At December31, 2004, a 10% weaker U.S. dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2004, would have resulted in an increase of our revenues by $34.3 million, and an increase of our pre-tax operating profit by $7.8 million. A 10% stronger U.S. dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenues and pre-tax operating profit.
Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our variable rate revolving credit debt and the interest rate swap agreements associated with portions of our fixed rate public debt. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors.
We attempt to achieve the lowest all-in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt, and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt. At December31, 2004, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.9% and weighted average life of debt was 6.7 years.
We generally target a mix of fixed and floating rate debt which lies within a range of 30-70% fixed, with the balance being floating rate. At December31, 2004, 62% of our debt was fixed rate, and the remaining 38% floating rate. We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by 43 entering into interest rate swaps. As of December31, 2004, we had $279.0 million, notional amount, of interest rate swap agreements outstanding with bank counterparties.
Our variable rate indebtedness consists primarily of our $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and a separate C$25.0 million revolving credit facility in Canada. The rate of interest we pay on our $500.0 million facility is based on a floating rate pricing grid tied to our long-term senior unsecured debt rating. We are currently rated A- by Standard& Poors and Baa1 by Moodys. In the case of a split rating, pricing is based on the higher rating, i.e., currently A- from Standard& Poors. We can borrow under the facility at floating rates of interest tied to Base Rate and LIBOR. A competitive bid option is also available, dependent on liquidity in the bank market. At December31, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding and $500.0 million of additional borrowing capacity was available under this facility. Borrowings under our Canadian facility bear interest at a floating rate tied to Prime, LIBOR or Canadian Bankers Acceptances. At December31, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding, and C$25.0 million (US$20.8 million) of additional borrowing capacity was available under our Canadian facility.
We have interest rate swap agreements in place to float the interest rate on $250.0 million of our fixed rate, 6.3% senior unsecured notes through their maturity date in 2005. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, were documented as fully effective under SFAS133, and were valued on a mark-to-market basis as an asset totaling $5.6 million at December31, 2004. The offsetting liability of $5.6 million is included in short-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These swaps give us the right to receive fixed rate payments from the counterparties, in exchange for floating rate payments from us. The floating rate payments on these interest rate swaps are tied to six-month LIBOR plus a spread, with net settlements paid semi-annually. The final maturity of these interest rate swaps is July2005, coinciding with the final maturity of the associated notes.
We also have a $29.0 million floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, maturing 2010, which fixes the effective rate of interest on the $29.0 million synthetic lease for our Atlanta corporate headquarters. This derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, was documented as fully effective under SFAS133, and was valued on a mark-to-market basis as a liability totaling $3.1 million at December31, 2004. This interest rate swap gives us the right to receive a floating rate payment tied to three-month LIBOR plus a spread from the counterparty, in exchange for a fixed rate payment from us. The net settlements occur quarterly.
A 1% increase in the average rate of interest on the variable rate debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities during 2004 would have increased our pre-tax interest expense by $0.8 million.
A 1% increase in the average rate of interest associated with the floating rate payments due under our interest rate swap agreements during 2004 would have increased our pretax interest expense by $2.5 million. Since all of our interest rate swaps are fully effective per SFAS133, our income statement is unaffected by the non-cash quarterly mark-to-market adjustments associated with these derivatives.

Equifaxs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Equifax;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States;  provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Equifax are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the Board of Directors of Equifax; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of Equifaxs internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of Equifaxs internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December31, 2004, Equifax maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Equifax included in this report, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting which is included on page 47 of this report.
46 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equifax Inc.: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Equifax Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Equifax Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Equifax Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Equifax Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 of Equifax Inc. and our report dated March15, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion therein.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement position. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equifax Inc. at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

53 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES Accounting Principles.
Our financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Basis of Consolidation.
Our consolidated financial statements include Equifax and all subsidiaries. The Company consolidates all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries, uses the equity method of accounting for investments in which the Company is able to exercise significant influence and uses the cost method for all other investments. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Nature of Operations.
We collect, organize and manage various types of financial, demographic and marketing information. Our products and services enable businesses to make credit and service decisions, manage their portfolio risk and develop marketing strategies concerning consumers and commercial enterprises. We serve customers across a wide range of industries, including the financial services, mortgage, retail, telecommunications, utilities, automotive, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. We also enable consumers to manage and protect their financial health through a portfolio of products offered directly to individuals. We have approximately 4,400 employees worldwide, and manage our business globally through the following three reporting segments: Equifax North America, Equifax Europe and Equifax Latin America. Our operations are predominantly located within the U.S., with foreign operations principally located in Canada, the U.K. and Brazil.
Our products and services are categorized as follows: Information Services, Marketing Services and Personal Solutions. Our Information Services products and services allow customers to make credit decisions about consumers and commercial enterprises. Our Marketing Services information products and databases enable customers to identify a target audience for marketing purposes, and our Personal Solutions products and services provide information to consumers which enable them to reduce their exposure to identity fraud and to monitor their credit health.
We develop, maintain and enhance secured proprietary information databases through compilation of accounts receivable information about consumers and businesses that we obtain from a variety of sources, such as credit granting institutions, public record information, including bankruptcies, liens and judgments, and marketing information from surveys and warranty cards. We process this information utilizing our proprietary information management systems and make it available to our customers in virtually any medium or format they choose.
Use of Estimates.
GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, we make these estimates and assumptions after exercising judgment and we believe that the estimates and assumptions inherent in our financial statements are reasonable, based upon information available to us at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for long-lived asset impairments, contingencies and the allowance for doubtful accounts, the use, recoverability and/or realizability of certain assets, including deferred tax and other assets, restructuring costs, the valuation of pension plan obligations and assets and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue.
We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, for which the corresponding products have been delivered or services have been rendered, the pricing of which is either fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee arrangement is reasonably assured. We consider the earnings process to be completed when we have fulfilled our specific obligations under the contract as demonstrated by evidence of product delivery or rendering of services.
54 Most of our revenues are based upon transactional activity generated by customers access to, or queries of, our proprietary databases. Revenues are typically usage-based and incorporate predetermined volume-tiered unit pricing. Some of our revenue is related to subscription-based contracts under which the customer pays a flat fee for a preset or unlimited volume of transactions or services. Revenue recognition in these cases is based upon pro-rating the related fee over the term of the contract. In conjunction with certain products and services, we charge non-refundable set-up and membership fees which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Revenue from the sale of decision or statistical models is recognized upon customer installation and acceptance. For certain products and services sold on a subscription basis, we recognize revenue pro rata over the term of the contract.
Some of our sales contracts contain multiple elements pertaining to the delivery of distinct products and services such as decisioning models, prescreening services, and database management services. These deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting to which we allocate the contract revenues based on specific evidence of their relative fair values. The individual deliverables are generally independent of each other and can be sold on a stand-alone basis without affecting their usefulness to the customer. If relative fair values cannot be established, revenue recognition is deferred until all elements within the contract have been delivered. Failure to satisfy a specific element in the arrangement does not result in the cancellation of the entire contract but rather would result in a pro rata refund to the customer.
Deferred revenue represents the liability for amounts billed in advance of service delivery, and is classified as either current or long-term deferred revenue, with the current portion representing services expected to be provided within the next twelve months. Current deferred revenue is included with other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $33.8 million and $22.9million respectively at December31, 2004 and 2003. In conjunction with the divestiture of our risk management collections businesses in the U.S. and Canada in October2000, certain of the proceeds received related to contracts to provide credit information products and services to the buyers over the next five to six years and were recorded in current and long-term deferred revenue. At December31, 2004 and 2003, $10.1 million and $11.6million, respectively, remained unrecognized, with $7.7million and $9.2million, respectively, included in long-term deferred revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. This deferred revenue will be recognized as the contracted products and services are provided.
Accounts Receivable.
In September2004, we entered into a new trade receivables-backed revolving credit facility. At December31, 2004, $111.1million of net accounts receivable had been sold to our wholly-owned subsidiary and is included in accounts receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not recognize interest income on our trade receivables.
Allowance for Doubtful Trade Accounts Receivable.
The provision for estimated losses on trade accounts receivable is based on historical write-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns and the establishment of specific reserves for customers in adverse financial condition or for existing contractual disputes wherein we are not assured of a favorable outcome. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $9.3million and $11.9million, respectively, at December31, 2004 and 2003. Increases to the provision are recorded as bad debt expense and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Bad debt expense was $2.9 million or 0.23% of revenue for 2004, $8.8million or 0.72% of revenue for 2003 and $10.1million or 0.91% of revenue for 2002. We reassess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable each reporting period. During 2004, we wrote off $4.5 million of accounts receivable and recovered $3.4 of previously written-off accounts receivable. During 2003, we wrote-off $17.0million of accounts receivable, which included $11.0million from our eMarketing business unit, and recovered $0.6million of previously written-off accounts receivable.
55 Costs of Services.
Costs of services consist primarily of data acquisition and royalties; customer service costs, which include: personnel costs to collect, maintain and update our proprietary databases, to develop and maintain software application platforms and to provide consumer and customer call center support; hardware and software expense associated with transaction processing systems; telecommunication and computer network expense; and occupancy costs associated with facilities where these functions are performed.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs paid to sales and administrative employees and management, fees for professional and consulting services and advertising costs.
Advertising.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $15.7million in 2004, $4.6million in 2003 and $2.9million in 2002.
Legal Contingencies.
We periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and can be estimated, we accrue a liability for estimated settlements and incurred but unpaid legal fees for services performed to date.
Income Taxes.
We base income tax expense on pre-tax financial accounting income, and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Significant judgment is required to determine our overall local, state, federal and foreign income tax expense due to transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax consequence is uncertain. We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that we estimate is likely to be received. We believe that our estimates are reasonable, however, the final outcome of tax matters may be different than the estimates reflected on our financial statements.
Earnings Per Share.
Our basic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated as income from continuing operations or net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding. The income amount used in our EPS calculations is the same for both basic and diluted EPS. A reconciliation of the weighted average outstanding shares used in the two calculations is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Inmillions) Weighted average   shares outstanding (basic) 131.3 134.5 136.2 Effect of dilutive   securities: Stock options 1.6 2.0 2.3 Long-term incentive plans 0.6 0.2  Weighted average shares   outstanding (diluted) 133.5 136.7 138.5 Cash and cash equivalents.
We consider cash and cash equivalents to be short-term cash investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Property and Equipment.
The cost of property and equipment is depreciated primarily on the straight-line basis over estimated asset lives of 30 to 50 years for buildings; useful lives, not to exceed lease terms, for leasehold improvements; three to ten years for data processing equipment (including capitalized software); and five to seven years for other fixed assets.
Certain internal use software and systems development costs are deferred and capitalized in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software 56 Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 97-13 Accounting for Costs Incurred with a Business Process Reengineering Project. Accordingly the specifically identified costs incurred to develop or obtain software and accompanying hardware which is intended for internal use are not capitalized until the determination is made as to the availability of a technically feasible solution to solve the pre-defined user and operating performance requirements as established during the preliminary stage of an internal use software development project. Costs incurred during a software development projects preliminary stage are expensed. Application development activities which are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration, development of interfaces, coding, testing, installation and the development of training materials. Costs of business process reengineering are expensed as incurred. We monitor the activities undertaken in our various software and systems development projects and analyze the associated costs, making appropriate distinction between and accounting for costs to be capitalized and costs to be expensed. Internal use software and systems development project costs that are deferred and capitalized are subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over a three to ten year period after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for its intended use.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
We monitor the status of our long-lived assets annually or more frequently if necessary, in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include: changes in business strategy, market conditions or the manner in which an asset is used; underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends. If potential indicators of impairment exist, we estimate recoverability based on the assets ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset. We estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related long-lived asset group. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We utilize the discounted present value of the associated future estimated cash flows to determine the assets fair value. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized a $2.4 million, $30.6 million and $0.0 million impairment charge, respectively. See Note6 for further details.
Other Assets.
Other assets at December31, 2004 and 2003 consist of the following: 2004 2003 (Inmillions) Purchased   software $ 20.4 $ 14.8 Prepaid pension   cost 18.2 17.0 Investments in   unconsolidated companies 0.4 28.5 Data purchases 5.6 2.7 Other 42.4 28.4 $ 87.0 $ 91.4 As discussed above under Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, we regularly review these assets to determine if conditions or circumstances exist or events have occurred that would indicate that an asset could be impaired, and, if appropriate, we recognize impairments by recording a charge against income. We believe that the long-lived assets, as reflected in the above table and the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, were appropriately valued at December31, 2004 and 2003. Amortization expense for other assets was $8.0million in 2004, $17.6 million in 2003 and $6.6million in 2002. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, related accumulated amortization balances were $23.2million and $28.3million, respectively.
57 Foreign Currency Translation.
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is those subsidiaries local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries at the year-end rate of exchange, and revenue and expenses at the average rates prevailing during the year. We record the resulting translation adjustment as a component of shareholders equity. We also record gains and losses resulting from the translation of inter-company balances of a long-term investment nature as a component of shareholders equity. We record foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which are not material, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Financial Instruments.
Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and short-term and long-term debt. The carrying amounts of these items, other than long-term debt, approximate their fair market values due to their short maturity. As of December31, 2004, the fair value of our long-term debt (determined primarily by broker quotes) was $426.3 million compared to its carrying value of $398.5 million.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
In accordance with the accounting and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No.148 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, we have elected to apply APB Opinion No.25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option and performance share plans. Accordingly, by our use of the intrinsic value method to account for stock-based employee compensation, we do not recognize compensation cost in connection with our stock option plans.
We have computed the proforma disclosures required under SFAS No.123 and SFAS No.148 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions: 2004 2003 2002 Dividend yield 0.5 % 0.4 % 0.3 % Expected   volatility 36.3 % 40.7 % 40.8 % Risk-free   interest rate 3.6 % 1.1 % 3.5 % Expected life in years 4.5 2.8 2.9 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Grants (all at   market price) $ 8.75 $ 5.59 $ 7.51 58 If we had elected to recognize compensation cost for these plans based on the fair value at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No.123, net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below (in millions, except per share amounts): TwelveMonthsEnded December31, 2004 2003 2002 (Inmillions,exceptpersharedata) Net income, as   reported $ 234.7 $ 164.9 $ 178.0 Add: Total   stock-based employee compensation expense, net of related tax effect, included in reported net income 1.5 2.3 2.0 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation   expense determined under fair value-based method for all awards, net of   related tax effects (6.4 ) (14.4 ) (16.1 ) Pro forma net income $ 229.8 $ 152.8 $ 163.9 Earnings per share: Basicas reported $ 1.79 $ 1.23 $ 1.31 Basicpro forma $ 1.75 $ 1.14 $ 1.20 Dilutedas reported $ 1.76 $ 1.21 $ 1.29 Dilutedpro forma $ 1.72 $ 1.12 $ 1.18 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
We recognize derivatives as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet at fair value, and the gain or loss related to the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges as a component of other comprehensive income.
We enter into hedging transactions in order to reduce financial volatility and manage the fixed-floating mix of our debt portfolio. As of December31, 2004, the only hedging transactions to which we were a counterparty consisted of interest rate swap agreements.
At December31, 2004, we have a $29.0 million notional amount floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement in place with a bank counterparty that fixes the interest rate on the $29.0 million synthetic lease related to our corporate headquarters through its maturity in 2010. This hedge has been designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133, is fully effective, and at December31, 2004, was marked to market and valued as a liability totaling $3.1 million. We determine the fair value of our interest rate swap derivative through the inquiry of the counterparty banks. This liability is included with other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related loss of $1.8 million was recorded, net of income tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The termination of the lease, whenever that occurs, of our headquarters building will result in the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings for the cash flow hedge.
At December31, 2004, we also have interest rate swap agreements in place with a bank counterparty to float the interest rate on $250.0 million of our fixed rate senior unsecured notes through their maturity date in 2005. These derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges and are fully effective. The value of these swaps was $5.6 million at December31, 2004, and is included with other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding increase in the amount of currently maturing short-term debt. Changes in the fair value of these swaps and that of the related debt are recorded in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, the net of which is zero in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Our maximum economic exposure to loss due to credit risk on these interest rate swap agreements approximates $2.5 million if all bank counterparties were to default. We manage this exposure by 59 monitoring the concentration of risk that we have with any one bank, and through the use of minimum credit quality standards for all counterparties.
2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No.00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No.00-21 provides guidance pertaining to the revenue recognition methodology to apply to revenue arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No.00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. We adopted EITF Issue No.00-21 on July1, 2003 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to SFAS No.132 Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The purpose of the revision is to require additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. These additional disclosures include information describing the types of plan assets, investment strategy, measurements date(s), plan obligations, cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized. As revised, SFAS132 enhances disclosures by providing more relevant information about the plan assets available to finance benefit payments, the obligation to pay benefits and an entitys obligation to fund the plan. This revised version of SFAS132 is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2003. We adopted the revisions to SFAS132 and have included the additional disclosures in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December2003, the FASB issued its revision to FASB Interpretation No.46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (an Interpretation of ARB No.51). FIN 46 addresses the consolidation by a reporting entity of variable interest entities that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or in which the equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Application of FIN 46 is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities (also referred to as special-purpose entities) for periods ending after December15, 2003. The FASB subsequently issued FASB Staff Positions (FSPs), which deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests in certain variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before February1, 2003 until the end of the first interim period ending after March15, 2004. These FSPs also required certain disclosures about variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities. We adopted the provisions of FIN 46 in March2004 and it has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104, or SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple-element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the SECs related Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104, which was effective upon issuance. We implemented SAB 104 in December2003 and it did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
60 In May2004, the FASB issued FSP No.106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. This staff position supersedes FSP No.106-1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 by clarifying the guidance on the recognition of the effects of the Act on employers accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Employers that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that provides prescription benefits that are deemed actuarially equivalent to the Medicare PartD benefit are eligible for a federal subsidy. This subsidy is to be treated as an actuarial experience gain in the calculation of the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. FSP 106-2 is effective for the first interim period or annual period beginning after June15, 2004. We adopted the accounting and disclosure provisions of FSP 106-2 in July2004 and it did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In July2004, the EITF of the FASB reached consensus Issue No.02-14 Whether the Equity Method of Accounting Applies When an Investor Does Not Have an Investment in Voting Stock of an Investee but Exercises Significant Influence through Other Means. EITF Issue No.02-14 provides guidance pertaining to an investors accounting when the investor has significant influence over an investee through means other than voting stock. The provisions of EITF No.02-14 apply to reporting periods beginning after September15, 2004. The Companys accounting for such investments has been consistent with EITF02-14 and its adoption during the fourth quarter of 2004 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R Share-Based Payments. SFAS 123R is a revision to SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R establishes standards for the accounting for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services from either employees or non-employees. This financial accounting standard requires the cost resulting from share-based payment transactions be recognized in the entitys financial statements as the goods are received or the services are rendered, and establishes fair value as the measurement objective for the accounting for such transactions. SFAS 123R is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June15, 2005 and applies to (a) all new awards granted after June15, 2005; (b) modifications, repurchases or cancellations occurring after June15, 2005, but pertaining to awards granted before June15, 2005; and (c) the unvested service component of outstanding awards granted prior to June15, 2005. SFAS 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in our third quarter beginning July 1, 2005 and expect that its impact on our financial position or results of operations will be in the range of our SFAS 123 pro forma amounts disclosed in Note 1.
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153 Exchanges of Non-monetary AssetsAn Amendment of APB Opinion No.29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions. SFAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the fair value measurement principal exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that lack commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to significantly change as result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 153 in July2005 and do not expect that it will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In December2004, the FASB issued FSPNo.109-2 Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). FSP109-2 specifically addresses the one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are 61 repatriated. In accordance with this FSP an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period covering the enactment of the Act, to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS109. FSP109-2 requires the following disclosures for an enterprise that has not completed its evaluation of the repatriation provisions: (a)a summary of the repatriation as it applies to the enterprise; (b)the expected completion date of the evaluation; (c)the expected effect on income tax expense or benefit; and (d)the amount of un-remitted earnings being considered for repatriation. FSP109-2 is effective upon issuance. We are utilizing the time allowed by FSP109-2 to evaluate the effect of the Act as it pertains to our foreign earnings and our application of SFAS109, and have included the requisite disclosures in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
3.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In the third quarter of 2002, we made the decision to exit our commercial services business in Spain in our Equifax Europe segment. During 2003 and the first six months of 2004, this business component remained as held for sale. We completed the sale and final disposition of the business and recorded a $0.5 million gain in the third quarter of 2004, of which $1.7 million related to the recognition of a cumulative translation adjustment loss into income. In accordance with SFAS 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the net assets, results of operations and cash flows of the Spain commercial business for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were classified as discontinued operations. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, revenues for this business component were $1.3 million, $8.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively. We had a $0.1 million gain on discontinued operations in 2004, a $13.6 million loss on discontinued operations in 2003 and $13.3 million loss on discontinued operations in 2002. Included in the 2003 losses was an estimated loss on disposal of $8.6 million recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2003.
After incurring losses in each of the last four years, we decided to sell our Italian operations, which were formerly included in our Equifax Europe segment, in the fourth quarter of 2004. In accordance with SFAS 144, the net assets, results of operations and cash flows of the Italian business for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were classified as discontinued operations. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, revenues for this business component were $11.4 million, $14.7 million and $14.0, respectively. We recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million related to the write-down of purchased data during the second quarter of 2004. We had a $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $0.4 million loss on discontinued operations in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We recorded a gain on the sale of $2.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2004, of which $5.7 million related to the recognition of a cumulative translation adjustment gain into income.
62 4. GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill.
Goodwill allocated to our reporting units at January 1, 2003 and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004, are as follows: ReportingUnits Information Services Marketing Services European Operations LatinAmerica Operations Total (Inmillions) Balance, January1,   2003 $ 185.7 $ 267.7 $ 94.1 $ 103.0 $ 650.5 * Acquisitions 12.7 6.9   19.6 Adjustments to prior   years purchase price allocation 1.0 10.1   11.1 Reclassifications (0.3 ) 1.5 0.3  1.5 Foreign currency   translation 7.3  12.9 21.4 41.6 Balance,   December31, 2003 206.4 286.2 107.3 124.5 * 724.3 * Acquisitions 4.1    4.1 Adjustments to prior   years purchase price allocation  (4.5 ) 1.6  (2.9 ) Foreign currency   translation 3.5  8.8 9.7 22.0 Balance, December31, 2004 $ 214.0 $ 281.7 $ 117.7 $ 134.2 $ 747.5 * * Does not total due to rounding Goodwill is the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. At least annually we evaluate goodwill for impairment. This evaluation is performed on a reporting unit basis and involves the determination of the reporting unit fair values based on discounted cash flow analyses corroborated by market multiple comparables. An impairment charge would result if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its implied value. Reporting units combine two or more business components and were determined on the basis of similarities pertaining to market geography, product offerings, customer profile, economic characteristics, operating margins and product fulfillment and delivery and methodologies. We determined the existence of five reporting units, i.e., Information Services, Marketing Services, Personal Solutions, European Operations and Latin America Operations. There were no goodwill impairment charges during 2004, 2003 or 2002.
Prior to 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis predominately over periods from twenty to forty years. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, accumulated amortization balances were $89.7 million and $87.7 million, respectively. The adjustments to prior years purchase price allocation in the table above relates primarily to revisions of Naviant and Italy deferred tax assets.
SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that reporting unit goodwill be re-evaluated and tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. Accordingly, we have updated our impairment evaluation as of September30, 2004 and determined that reporting unit goodwill remained unimpaired. However, future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. We will continue to evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value.
63 Purchased Intangible Assets.
Purchased intangible assets, as recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets used in our products and services. Purchased data files, net, is the carrying value of files acquired primarily through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the U.S. and Canada. We expense the cost of modifying and updating credit files in the period such costs are incurred.
2004 2003 Gross Accumulated amortization Net Gross Accumulated amortization Net (Inmillions) Purchased data   files $ 405.4 $ (171.7 ) $ 233.7 $ 424.9 $ (181.6 ) $ 243.3 Acquired software 10.4 (8.2 ) 2.2 26.1 (21.9 ) 4.2 Non-compete   agreements 11.7 (7.3 ) 4.4 14.1 (6.4 ) 7.7 Contractual/territorial   rights 41.0  41.0 41.0  41.0 Total purchased   intangible assets $ 468.5 $ (187.2 ) $ 281.3 $ 506.1 $ (209.9 ) $ 296.2 We amortize purchased data files over a 15 year period on a straight line basis. Acquired software is amortized over a period of three to ten years; and non-compete agreements are amortized over a period of two to three years. Our contractual/territorial rights are perpetual in nature and, therefore, the useful lives are considered indefinite. Amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets was approximately $36.2 million, $51.8 million and $33.6 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Estimated future amortization expense related to finite-lived purchased intangible assets at December31, 2004 is as follows: Amount (Inmillions) 2005 $ 28.5 2006 24.8 2007 23.4 2008 23.1 2009 21.8 Thereafter 118.7 $ 240.3 We perform annual impairment tests for our purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. Based on the results of our impairment tests, we determined that no impairment of the contractual/territorial rights existed at December31, 2004 or December31, 2003. However, future impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. We will continue to evaluate our purchased intangible assets annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment of the asset value.

ACQUISITIONS During 2004, we acquired two independent credit reporting agencies located in the U.S. (also referred to as Affiliates) and one Affiliate located in Canada, that house their consumer information on our system. We acquired all of these businesses for $17.4million in cash, allocating $11.7million of the purchase price to purchased data files, $4.1million to goodwill and $1.6million to non-compete agreements. See Note 4 for a discussion of our purchased intangible assets. The results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition, and are not material.
During 2003, we acquired three Affiliates located in the U.S. and one Affiliate located in Canada, that house their consumer information on our system. Additionally, in April2003 we completed the purchase of 64 a small eMarketing business for $10.0million. We acquired all of these businesses for $41.0million in cash and $1.9 million in liabilities, allocating $15.5million of the purchase price to purchased data files, $19.6million to goodwill and $5.9million to non-compete agreements. In the case of the eMarketing business, the preliminary purchase price allocation did not include the involuntarily termination of certain employees of the acquired company during 2004. The results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition, and are not material.
The above acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and had a total cash purchase price of $58.4 million. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition dates.

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES In the second quarter of 2004, we determined that continued difficulties with our eMarketing operations indicated that certain remaining assets may not be fully recoverable. Subsequently, we estimated their recoverability using undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the related eMarketing long-lived asset. The carrying value of the asset exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and an impairment loss was recorded based on the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded its estimated value. We estimated the fair value of the asset by discounting the present value of the future cash flows of the asset. We recorded asset impairment and related charges of $2.4 million ($1.5 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). The asset impairment charges are primarily for purchased data in our Marketing Services segment. No restructuring charges were associated with this asset impairment. An analysis of the impairment charges taken is as follows (in millions): PurchasedData Other Totals Marketing   Services $ 1.4 $ 1.0 $ 2.4 65 In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded restructuring, impairment and other related charges related to our eMarketing business of $25.9 million ($16.3 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share). The restructuring charges, which totaled $3.3 million, were associated with reducing headcount, consolidating multiple locations and eliminating our bulk e-mail product. The asset impairment charges, which totaled $22.6 million, reflected our write-down of amortizable intangible assets, indefinite lived intangible assets and fixed assets of our eMarketing business. At December31, 2003, our remaining reserve balance was $3.3 million. During 2004, we paid $2.1 million against the reserve, leaving a remaining balance of $1.2 million. An analysis of 2004 activity in the reserve is as follows (in millions): Severance Facilities andOther Total Balance,   December31, 2003 $ 1.1 $ 2.2 $ 3.3 Less, current period payments (0.8 ) (1.3 ) (2.1 ) Balance,   December31, 2004 $ 0.3 $ 0.9 $ 1.2 7. LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Long-term debt at December31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: December31, 2004 December31, 2003 (Inmillions) Notes, 6.3%, due   2005, net of unamortized discount of $0.1 million and $0.3 million at December31,   2004 and December31, 2003, respectively $ 249.9 $ 249.7 Notes, 4.95%, due   2007, net of unamortized discount of $0.3 million and $0.4 million at   December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, respectively 249.7 249.6 Debentures, 6.9%,   due 2028, net of unamortized discount of $1.2 million at December31,   2004 and December31, 2003 148.8 148.8 Borrowings under   U.S. revolving credit facilities, weighted-average rate of 1.6% at   December31, 2003  137.1 Other 5.8 16.8 654.2 802.0 Less current   maturities 255.7 139.0 $398.5 $ 663.0 In July2004, $249.9 million of our 6.3% Notes due 2005 became current. These notes are classified as short-term debt in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2004. On July1, 2005, we expect to retire our 6.3% notes by utilizing our cash flow from operations and by borrowing under our revolving credit and asset securitization agreements.
In August2004, we entered into a new five-year, $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement. The new facility provides for a variable interest rate tied to a Base Rate, LIBOR plus a specified margin or competitive bid options similar to those contained in the previous facility. The new facility replaces a $465.0 million revolving credit facility. Under our senior credit agreement, we must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain a leverage ratio, consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated EBITDA (as defined by the agreement) from the preceding four quarters, of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 (raised to 3.25 to 1.0 for four fiscal quarters if the CSC Put option described in Note 11 below is exercised) and a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined by the agreement) for the preceding four quarters divided by consolidated interest expense for the preceding four quarters, of not less than 4.0 to 1.0. Compliance with 66 these financial covenants is tested quarterly on a rolling four quarters basis. At December 31, 2004, our maximum leverage ratio was 1.4 and our minimum interest coverage ratio was 14.4. The non-financial covenants include limitations on liens, cross defaults subsidiary debt, mergers, liquidations, asset dispositions and acquisitions. Our borrowings under this facility, which have not been guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries, are unsecured and will rank on parity in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. As of December31, 2004, $500.0 million was available and there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. As of December31, 2004, we were in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement.
In September2004, we entered into a new trade receivables-backed revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax may borrow up to $125.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability and other terms and conditions. Equifax will use the net proceeds received from the sale of its trade receivables to the subsidiary for general corporate purposes. The credit facility has an expiration date of September6, 2005, but may be extended for an additional period of up to three years if specified conditions are satisfied. Loans will bear interest at commercial paper rates, LIBOR or Base Rate plus a specified margin. Outstanding debt under the facility will be consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes. As of December31, 2004, $84.0 million was available and no amounts were outstanding under this facility.
In October2002, we issued new 4.95% fixed rate five-year senior unsecured notes with a face value of $250.0 million. The notes, which expire in 2007, were sold at a discount of $0.5 million. The discount, and related issuance costs, will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes. Our $200.0 million 6.5% senior unsecured notes, originally issued in 1993, matured in June2003. We borrowed $200.0 million under our revolving credit facility to retire the maturing notes. The indebtedness evidenced by our 4.95% senior unsecured notes, our 6.3% senior unsecured notes and our 6.9% senior unsecured debentures, none of which has been guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries, is unsecured, and ranks on parity in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
Scheduled maturities of long-term debt during the five years subsequent to December31, 2004, are as follows: Amount (Inmillions) 2005 $ 255.7 2006  2007 249.7 2008  2009  Thereafter 148.8 $ 654.2 Our short-term borrowings at December31, 2004 and 2003, totaled $0.0 million and $21.5 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of notes payable to banks. These notes had a weighted average interest rate of 1.8% at December31, 2003. One of our Canadian subsidiaries had an unsecured, 364-day C$100.0 million revolving credit facility that expired on September30, 2004. The agreement provided for borrowings tied to the Prime Rate, Base Rate, LIBOR or Canadian Bankers Acceptances, and contains financial covenants related to interest coverage, funded debt to cash flow and limitations on subsidiary indebtedness. We guaranteed the indebtedness of our Canadian subsidiary under this credit facility. The bank agreed to carry the amounts outstanding under the facility on a demand basis following the expiration of the revolver on September30, 2004, and the remaining balance was paid in October2004. Borrowings under this loan (which are included in the 2003 short-term borrowings totals above) at December31, 2003 were $15.4 million.
67 In November2004, we entered into a C$25.0 million revolving credit facility that replaced the C$100.0 million facility that expired in September2004. The C$25.0 million facility expires in September2005. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December31, 2004.
Cash paid for interest was $34.9 million in 2004, $39.6 million in 2003 and $41.8 million in 2002.
8. INCOME TAXES We record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of the following: 2004 2003 2002 (Inmillions) Current: Federal $ 74.7 $ 63.5 $ 71.9 State 12.9 5.7 10.0 Foreign 24.7 22.8 21.4 112.3 92.0 103.3 Deferred: Federal 30.9 11.4 23.3 State 2.7  (1.9 ) Foreign 2.0 1.2 (0.3 ) 35.6 12.6 21.1 $147.9 $ 104.6 $ 124.4 Domestic and foreign income from continuing operations before income taxes was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Inmillions) United States $ 302.8 $ 214.9 $ 264.5 Foreign 82.4 70.4 51.6 $385.2 $ 285.3 $ 316.1 The provision for income taxes from continuing operations is reconciled with the federal statutory rate, as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Inmillions) Federal statutory   rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Provision computed at federal statutory rate $ 134.8 $ 99.9 $ 110.6 State and local   taxes, net of federal tax benefit 10.3 0.6 5.0 Foreign 2.0 (9.1 ) (8.4 ) Valuation   allowance (13.0 ) 7.4 21.1 Tax reserves 12.9 (0.8)  Other 0.9 6.6 (3.9 ) $147.9 $ 104.6 $ 124.4 68 Components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 (Inmillions) Deferred income tax   assets: Reserves and accrued expenses $ 18.9 $ 17.1 Postretirement benefits 71.1 71.5 Employee compensation programs 17.1 12.6 Deferred revenue 4.8 7.0 Depreciation  0.2 Net operating loss carryforwards of subsidiaries 26.7 40.1 Foreign tax credits 21.9 19.1 Unrealized foreign exchange loss 41.4 58.5 Valuation allowance (88.0 ) (111.9 ) Other 4.2 3.6 118.1 117.8 Deferred income tax   liabilities: Data files and other assets (62.2 ) (50.5 ) Depreciation (1.5 )  Pension expense (70.2 ) (61.9 ) Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (7.9 ) (8.0 ) Other (1.7 ) (1.2 ) (143.5 ) (121.6 ) Net deferred income tax   liability $ (25.4 ) $ (3.8 ) Our deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December31, 2004 and 2003, are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: 2004 2003 (Inmillions) Current deferred   income tax assets $ 13.2 $ 15.5 Deferred income   tax liabilities (38.6 ) (19.3 ) Net deferred income tax   liability $ (25.4 ) $ (3.8 ) We record deferred income tax on the temporary differences of our foreign subsidiaries and branches, except for the temporary differences attributable to pre-2004 undistributed earnings of Canadian and Chilean subsidiaries which we consider to be indefinitely invested that amounted to approximately $74.5 million and $93.6 million at December31, 2003 and December31, 2004, respectively. We recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million in 2004 attributable to our Chilean subsidiary to reflect our determination that the pre-2004 undistributed earnings are indefinitely invested. If the pre-2004 earnings were not considered indefinitely invested, approximately $7.0 million of deferred income taxes would have been provided. Such taxes, if ultimately paid, may be recoverable as foreign tax credits in the U.S.
A provision for Canadian withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 million has been made on the 2004 retained earnings of Canadian subsidiaries of approximately $23.4 million. We have determined that the 2004 earnings of our Canadian subsidiaries are not indefinitely invested.
As of December31, 2004, we had a deferred tax asset of $41.4 million related to accumulated foreign currency translation loss for foreign locations, excluding adjustments for current year Canadian and 69 Chilean earnings. A full valuation allowance, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, has been provided due to uncertainty of future realization of this deferred tax asset.
At December31, 2004, we had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards of approximately $194.1 million of which $135.4 million related to U.S. federal and state and $58.8 million to foreign jurisdictions. Of the total net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, $22.1 million will expire in 2005, $35.9 million will expire in 2006 and $136.1 million will begin to expire at various times beginning in 2012. Additionally, we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $21.9 million of which $15.3 million will begin to expire in 2010 and the remaining $6.6 million will be utilized upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Tax effected state net operating loss, capital loss, foreign tax credit carryforwards and other foreign deferred tax assets of $46.6million have been fully reserved in the deferred tax valuation allowance due to the uncertainty resulting from a lack of previous foreign taxable income within certain foreign tax jurisdictions and uncertainty that sufficient capital gains will be generated.
A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We released valuation allowance of $12.9 million in 2004 for capital loss carryovers in the U.S. and foreign net operating loss carryforwards relating to Spain. In addition, we released valuation allowance of $3.9million in 2004 associated with acquired net operating losses. The tax benefit of the $3.9million release was recorded as a reduction to goodwill.
On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. Equifax may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations during its 2005 tax year. Equifax has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. Equifax expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $100.0 million. Due to complexity of the provisions of the AJCA and pending additional clarifying language, the range of possible income tax effects of potential repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Cash paid for income taxes, net of amounts refunded was $102.2 million in 2004, $84.6 million in 2003 and $92.6 million in 2002.
9.
SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Rights Plan.
In 1995, our Board of Directors adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan (Rights Plan). Our Rights Plan contains provisions to protect our shareholders in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire us, including offers that do not treat all shareholders equally, the acquisition in the open market of shares constituting control without offering fair value to all shareholders and other coercive, unfair or inadequate takeover bids and practices that could impair the ability of our Board to represent shareholders interests fully. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, our Board declared a dividend of one Share Purchase Right for each outstanding share of our common stock, with distribution to be made to shareholders of record as of November24, 1995. The Rights, which will expire in November2005 unless renewed by the Board of Directors, initially will be represented by, and traded together with, our common stock. The Rights are not currently exercisable and do not become exercisable unless certain triggering events occur. Among the triggering events is the acquisition of 20% or more of our common stock by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons. Unless previously redeemed, upon the occurrence of one of the specified triggering events, each Right that is not held by the 20% or more shareholder will entitle its holder to purchase one share of common stock or, under certain circumstances, additional shares of common stock at a discounted price.
70 Treasury Stock.
During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we repurchased 5.4 million, 4.2 million and 2.9 million of our common shares through open market transactions at an aggregate investment of $138.0 million, $95.0 million and $72.5 million, respectively. In addition to the remaining authorized shares from our Board of Directors previous authorization in February2002, the Board authorized an additional $250.0 million in share repurchases in August2004. At December31, 2004, approximately $239.3 million remained available for future purchases from prior authorizations of our Board of Directors.
Stock Options.
Our shareholders have approved several stock option plans which provide that qualified and nonqualified options may be granted to officers and employees. Our Board of Directors has also approved a nonqualified stock option plan that cannot be used to grant shares to directors or executive officers. In addition, options remain outstanding under two plans from which no new grants may be made, one of which was approved by shareholders. In October 2004, the Board of Directors approved that authorized grants would only be made from shareholder approved plans, resulting in cancellation of shares previously available for future grants. All plans require that options be granted at exercise prices not less than market value on the date of grant. Generally, options vest over periods of up to 3 years and are exercisable for ten years from grant date. Certain of the plans also provide for awards of restricted shares of our common stock. At December31, 2004, there were 1.4 million shares available for future option grants and restricted stock awards.
A summary of changes in outstanding options and the related weighted average exercise price per share is shown in the following table: 2004 2003 2002 (Sharesinthousands) Shares AveragePrice Shares AveragePrice Shares AveragePrice Balance, December   31, 2003 11,126 $ 19.65 10,554 $ 18.47 10,824 $ 16.35 Granted (all at   market price) 935 25.70 2,984 21.06 2,398 25.05 Cancelled (270 ) 20.17 (738 ) 21.53 (354 ) 18.74 Exercised (2,307 ) 17.47 (1,674 ) 13.93 (2,314 ) 15.31 Balance, December   31, 2004 9,484 $ 20.76 11,126 $ 19.65 10,554 $ 18.47 Exercisable at   end of year 7,891 $ 20.16 9,076 $ 19.14 8,217 $ 17.58 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December31, 2004 (shares in thousands): OptionsOutstanding OptionsExercisable Weighted Average Remaining Weighted Weighted Contractual Average Average Lifein Exercise Exercise Rangeofexerciseprices Shares Years Price Shares Price $7.40 to $15.24 2,003 4.23 $ 13.53 2,003 $ 13.53 $15.47 to $20.87 1,509 5.63 18.13 1,386 18.03 $21.11 to $24.18 2,977 6.87 21.85 2,447 21.97 $24.30 to $25.50 1,886 7.09 25.43 1,566 25.46 $25.55 to $37.25 1,109 7.60 26.52 489 27.42 9,484 6.25 $ 20.76 7,891 $ 20.16 Restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of three to five years.

Chapman, chairman and chief executive officer, will fully vest in 2005 due to his retirement. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of general condition and Results of OperationsCEO Transition. Restricted Stock expense of 71 $2.4 million in 2004, $3.7 million in 2003 and $3.3 million in 2002 was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

We have a Key Management Long-Term Incentive Plan for certain key officers that provides for annual or long term cash awards at the end of various measurement periods based on the earnings per share and/or various other criteria over the measurement period. For certain awards, the employee may elect to receive some or all of their distribution as an equity interest. This feature of the plan ended with the 2002 payout. The total long-term related expense under this plan was $1.6 million in 2002.
In December2003, the Board approved a new Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for executives of Equifax that covers designated executives of Equifax Officers, effective January1, 2004. The total expense under this plan was $0.7 million and $0.0 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
10. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension Benefits.
Pension benefits are provided through U.S. and Canadian defined benefit pension plans and two supplemental executive defined benefit pension plans.
U.S. and Canadian Retirement Plans.
We have a non-contributory qualified retirement plan covering most U.S. salaried employees (the U.S. Retirement Income Plan, or USRIP) and maintain a defined benefit plan for most salaried employees in Canada (the Canadian Retirement Income Plan, or CRIP). Benefits of both plans are primarily a function of salary and years of service.
Supplemental Retirement Plans.
We maintain two supplemental executive retirement programs for certain key employees. The plans, which are unfunded, provide supplemental retirement payments based on salary and years of service.
Other Benefits.
We maintain certain health care and life insurance benefit plans for eligible retired employees. Substantially all of our U.S. employees may become eligible for the health care benefits if they reach retirement age while working for us and satisfy certain years of service requirements. The retiree life insurance program was frozen to new participants on December31, 2003. We accrue the cost of providing these benefits over the active service period of the employee.

The USRIP and the Supplemental Retirement Plans both have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of those plans respective assets as of December31, 2004. The aggregate projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for these two plans are $515.4 million, $499.1 million and $438.4 million, respectively, as of December31, 2004, and $483.9 million, $469.2 million and $398.3 million, respectively, as of December31, 2003.
Other comprehensive income includes a $2.6 million decrease in the minimum pension liability as of December 31, 2004 and a $3.6 million increase as of December 31, 2003.

The increase in the value of the pension plan assets was primarily related to a 13.2% investment return which was greater than the 8.75% expected rate of return set at December31, 2003. The calculation of the net periodic benefit cost for the USRIP utilizes a market-related value of assets. The market-related value of assets recognizes the difference between actual returns and expected returns over five years at a rate of 20% per year.
An initial 12% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2005. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% by 2010. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1- Percentage 1- Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Sensitivity to assumed health   care cost trend rate Effect on total   2004 service cost and interest cost components $ 0.2 $ (0.2 ) Effect on   December31, 2004 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 2.1 (1.8 ) On December8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As provided for in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the obligations reflect that we will recognize the 28% subsidy for post-65 drug 74 coverage as an offset to healthcare plan costs. The reduction in obligations due to the subsidy is reflected as an unrecognized net gain to the plan. The gain was reflected in net periodic benefit cost for the first time in 2004. For current and future retirees, the 28% subsidy is expected to reduce our prescription drug plan costs by $567 per individual in 2006 and this amount is expected to increase by the valuation trend rates. Our actuaries have determined that our prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug plan. The calculations do not reflect the final regulations issued in January2005.
Equifax estimates that the future benefits payable for the retirement and post-retirement plans in place are as follows at December 31, 2004: U.S.Defined BenefitPlans Non-U.S.Defined BenefitPlans Post-Retirement BenefitPlans (inmillions) Fiscal year   ending December31 2005 $ 32.4 $ 2.0 $ 3.0 2006 $ 33.7 $ 2.0 $ 3.3 2007 $ 33.6 $ 2.0 $ 3.4 2008 $ 33.9 $ 2.1 $ 3.6 2009 $ 34.1 $ 2.1 $ 3.6 Next five fiscal   years to December31, 2014 $ 175.7 $ 11.0 $ 15.7 USRIP (the Plan) Investment and Asset Allocation Strategies The primary goal of the asset allocation strategy of the Plan is to produce a total investment return, employing the lowest possible level of financial risk, which will: (1)satisfy annual cash benefits payments to Plan participants and (2)maintain and increase the total market value of the USRIP, after cash benefits payments, on a real (inflation adjusted) basis.
Maximization of total investment return is not, taken in isolation, a goal of the asset allocation strategy of the USRIP. Return maximization is pursued subject to the asset allocation risk control constraints noted previously.
The Plans investment managers are required to abide by the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Standards of performance for each manager include an expected return, a measure of volatility, and a time period of evaluation.
USRIP asset allocation strategy is determined based upon guidelines provided by our external advisor. This forecasting process takes into account projected investment returns by asset category, the correlation among those returns, the standard deviation of those returns and the future pattern of actuarial liabilities to which the plan is obligated. Asset/liability forecasting is conducted at regular intervals during the year, as needed, utilizing input from our in-house and external consulting actuaries, and our external investment advisor. All USRIP asset targets and ranges are approved by two in-house Plan Administrators, who are Named Fiduciaries under ERISA. Investment recommendations are made by our external advisor, working in conjunction with our in-house Investment Officer, who is also an ERISA Named Fiduciary. The 8.75% expected return on plan assets assumption for 2004 is based on the 50th percentile return from our asset/liability forecasting process.
75 The following USRIP asset allocation ranges, targets and actual allocations were in effect as of December31, 2004 and 2003: Target Range Actual 2004 Actual 2003 Large-Cap equity 25 % 20-35 % 20.5 % 30.5 % Mid-Cap equity 10 % 5-15 % 10.3 % 5.4 % Small-Cap equity 8 % 5-15 % 14.7 % 15.8 % International   equity 12 % 6-18 % 15.8 % 13.6 % Alternative   Assets 15 % 5-20 % 15.8 % 9.4 % Venture Capital 10 % 5-15 % 5.7 % 5.8 % Real Estate 5 % 0-12 % 3.5 % 3.2 % Fixed Income 15 % 10-35 % 12.8 % 15.7 % Cash minimal 0-2 % 0.9 % 0.7 % *Note: New USRIP asset allocation targets and ranges were put into place during 2003.
The USRIP, in an effort to meet its asset allocation objectives, utilizes a variety of asset classes which have historically produced returns which are relatively uncorrelated to those of the S&P 500. Asset classes included in this category are alternative assets (hedge funds-of-funds), venture capital (including secondary private equity) and real estate. The primary benefits to the USRIP of using these types of asset classes are: (1)their non-correlated returns reduce the over-all volatility of the USRIPs portfolio of assets, and (2)they produce superior risk-adjusted returns.
Additionally, the USRIP allows certain of its managers, subject to specific risk constraints, to utilize derivative instruments, in order to enhance asset return, reduce volatility or both. Derivatives are primarily employed by the Plan in its fixed income portfolio and in the hedge fund-of-funds area.
The USRIP is prohibited from investing additional amounts in Equifax Inc. stock once the market value of stock held by the plan exceeds 10% of the total market value of the USRIP. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the USRIPs assets included 1.8 million shares of Equifax common stock, with a market value of approximately $49.6 million and $43.2 million, respectively.
Additionally, the USRIP is subject to the transaction prohibitions imposed by ERISA. Not more than 5% of the portfolio (at cost) shall be invested in the securities of any one issuer with the exception of Equifax common stock, and U.S. Treasury and Government Agency securities.
Foreign Retirement Plans.
We also maintain defined contribution plans for certain employees in the U.K. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our expenses related to these plans were $1.4 million, $0.7 million and $1.2million for each year, respectively.
Employee Retirement Savings Plans.
Our retirement savings plans provide for annual contributions by us, within specified ranges, determined at the discretion of the Group Plans Administrative Committee, for the benefit of eligible employees in the form of units of Equifax common stock. Employees may transfer all or a part of these Equifax common stock investments into other available investments within the plan, at any time. Our matching contributions are expensed. Expenses for these plans were $3.2million in 2004, $3.1million in 2003 and $3.0million in 2002.
76 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases.
Our operating leases involve principally office space and office equipment. Under the terms of the $29.0 million operating lease for our headquarters building in Atlanta, Georgia, which commenced in 1998 and expires in 2010, we have guaranteed a portion of the residual value of the building at the end of the lease. Total lease payments for the remaining term total $9.7 million. In the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term, we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds, up to a maximum amount of $23.2 million, which equals 80% of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term. Based on a current appraisal of the property, we determined that its fair value is $25.0 million. The $4.0 million short-fall against the residual value guarantee will be subsequently recognized as an expense ratably over the remaining lease term.
Rental expense related to our operating leases was $22.3 million in 2004, $18.0 million in 2003 and $22.0 million in 2002. Our headquarters building operating lease has ground purchase options exercisable beginning in 2019, ground renewal options exercisable in 2048 and escalation clauses beginning in 2009. Our technology center lease in Alpharetta, Georgia expires in 2012 and includes renewal options through 2039. Future minimum payment obligations for non-cancelable operating leases exceeding one year are as follows as of December31, 2004: Amount (Inmillions) 2005 $ 14.6 2006 11.0 2007 8.9 2008 9.2 2009 52.0 Thereafter 12.2 $ 107.9 Data Processing and Outsourcing Services Agreements.
We have separate agreements with IBM, Polk/Acxiom and others with which we outsource portions of our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. The agreements expire between 2005 and 2013. The estimated aggregate minimal contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is $389.4 million as of December31, 2004, with no future year expected to exceed $70.8 million. Annual payment obligations in regards to these agreements vary due to factors such as the volume of data processed, changes in our servicing needs as a result of new product offerings, acquisitions or divestitures, the introduction of significant new technologies or the general rate of inflation. Our data processing outsourcing agreement with IBM was renegotiated in 2003 for a ten-year term. Under this agreement (which covers our operations in North America, the U.K., Ireland and Spain), we have outsourced our mainframe and midrange operations, help service and desktop support functions and the operation of our voice and data networks. During 2004, we paid $110.5 million for these services. The estimated future minimum contractual obligation under this agreement is $361.8 million, with no year expected to exceed $54.5 million. In certain circumstances (e.g., a change in control, or for our convenience), we may terminate these data processing and outsourcing agreements, and in doing so certain of these agreements require us to pay a significant penalty.
Agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation.
We have an agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation and certain of its affiliates, collectively, CSC, under which CSC-owned credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services. CSC retains ownership of its credit files and the revenues generated by its credit reporting activity. We receive a processing fee for maintaining the database and for each report supplied. The agreement was renewed by CSC for a ten-year period beginning August1, 1998. The agreement provides us with an option to purchase CSCs credit reporting 77 business if CSC does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of CSC while the agreement is in effect. Under the agreement CSC also has an option, exercisable at any time, to sell its credit reporting business to us. The option expires in 2013. The option exercise price will be determined by a third-party appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option. We estimate that if the option were exercised at this time, the price range would approximate $650.0 - $700.0 million. This estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the businesses, current market conditions and other factors, all of which are subject to constant change. Therefore, the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount. If CSC were to exercise its option, we would have to obtain additional sources of funding. We believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt and/or equity. However, the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors, including credit market conditions, the state of the equity markets, general economic conditions, and our financial performance and condition. See PartII, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk Factors included in our annual report on Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2004.
Change in Control Agreements.
We have Change in Control Agreements with certain of our key officers. These agreements have renewable five-year terms and become effective only upon a change in control of Equifax. A change in control is generally defined by the agreements to mean (i)an accumulation by any person, entity or group of 20% or more of the combined voting power of Equifaxs voting stock, or (ii)a business combination resulting in the shareholders immediately prior to the combination owning less than two-thirds of the common stock and combined voting power of the new company, (iii)a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of Equifaxs assets, or (iv)a complete liquidation or dissolution of Equifax. If any of these events occur and the officers employment terminates within three years after the date of the change in control, other than from death, disability or termination for cause or voluntary termination other than for good reason, the officer will be entitled to receive: (a)unpaid compensation accrued through the date of termination; (b)three times the sum of (i)the officers highest annual salary for the twelve months prior to termination, and (ii)the officers highest bonus for the three years prior to termination; (c)additional compensation and service credit under retirement plans to age 62 (five years maximum additional service credit); and (d)continuation of group health, dental, vision, life, disability, 401(k) and similar coverages for three years. Benefits payable under these agreements and other compensation or benefit plans of Equifax are not reduced to satisfy the limits of Section280G of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, any payments the officer receives will be increased, if necessary, so that after taking into account all taxes the officer would incur as a result of those payments, the officer would receive the same after-tax amount he or she would have received had no excise tax been imposed under Section4999 of the Code.
Assuming a change in control had occurred on December31, 2004, and employment had been terminated on that date, the approximate payments that would have been made under the Change in Control Agreements (not including the gross-up portion) would have been $31million, and the officers unvested outstanding stock options and restricted stock units would have become fully vested. The amount of the gross-up, if any, to be paid may be substantial and will depend upon numerous factors, including the price per share of Equifax common stock and the extent, if any, that payments or benefits made to the officers constitute excess parachute payments within the meaning of Section280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
Guarantees.
We will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. The aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby of all letters of credit is less than $8.0 million and all have a maturity of less than one year. Guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of operating units. The only outstanding guarantee that is not reflected as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was extended in 78 connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to RMA Holdings, LLC (RMA) in October2000, at which time we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with RMA to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan. The operating lease, which expires December11, 2011, has a remaining balance of $8.4 million based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments at December31, 2004. Our obligations under such guarantee are not secured. We believe the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expect no material losses to occur in connection with these instruments.
Subsidiary Dividends and Fund Transfers.
The ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments, which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends.
Litigation.
In November2001, the landlord of our former headquarters facility brought an action, 1600 Peachtree, L.L.C. v. EquifaxInc., against us in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, which asserted claims related to our guaranty obligations under our lease termination agreement. This lawsuit seeks damages, of approximately $28.0million, substantially all of which represents future rent contingencies, and punitive damages. On motions for summary judgment, the Superior Court ruled against our discharge defense and against plaintiffs fraud claim. On June29, 2004, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Courts rulings. Both parties appealed these rulings to the Georgia Supreme Court, which on September27, 2004 declined to hear the appeals. The remaining issues in the case will now be tried in Superior Court. Trial is set to commence on May4, 2005. We intend to continue to contest in the Superior Court the damages claimed by the plaintiff.
In the third quarter of 2003, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issued Notices of Reassessment asserting that Acrofax,Inc., a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Equifax, is liable for additional tax for the 1995 through 2000 tax years, related to certain intercompany capital contributions and loans. In 1995, Acrofax invested U.K. 30 million pounds in Luxembourg S.A., a Luxembourg subsidiary of Equifax (LUX), which subsequently lent that amount to Equifax PLC, a U.K. subsidiary of Equifax. In June2000, Acrofax distributed via dividend shares of LUX to Equifax Credit Information Services, Inc. another subsidiary of Equifax. The CRA claimed that (1)by using LUX as an intermediary, Acrofax avoided paying tax on interest earned on the loan to Equifax PLC and is therefore taxable on the dividends it received from LUX; and (2)in the alternative, the transactions should be recharacterized as a loan directly from Acrofax to Equifax PLC and tax should be paid by Acrofax on the amount of interest income that it would have received from such a loan as well as withholding tax on the loan principal. The additional tax sought by the CRA for these periods ranges, based on alternative theories, from $7.1 million to $15.8 million, plus interest and penalties. Acrofax has filed Notices of Objection in response to the Notices. On September2, 2003, we paid a statutorily-required deposit of $5.7 million against the CRAs primary assessment theory. We intend to vigorously contest these reassessments and do not believe we have violated any statutory provision or rule.
On December30, 2003, Equifax and Naviant served a demand for arbitration alleging, among other things, that the shareholder sellers of Naviant had breached various representations and warranties concerning information furnished to us in connection with our acquisition of Naviant in 2002. The arbitration demand seeks rescission of our Naviant purchase and the recovery of the purchase price or, in the alternative, recovery of monetary damages on various grounds. On March22, 2004, we recommenced our demand for arbitration in order to utilize the procedures of the American Arbitration Association. Some of the respondents have answered and denied liability. The arbitration has been stayed by agreement pending determination of the motions noted in the litigation described in the next paragraph. We cannot at this time predict the probable outcome of this matter.
79 On April28, 2004, in a case captioned Softbank Capital Partners LP, et al. v. Equifax Inc. and Naviant,Inc., certain of the former shareholders of Naviant filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida seeking declaratory relief to prevent Equifax and Naviant from proceeding with the arbitration discussed in the the preceding paragraph, except for claims asserted against Softbank Capital Partners LP, as Shareholders Representative, for certain indemnified losses capped at the amount of a $10.0 million escrow fund specified in the agreement pursuant to which Equifax acquired Naviant. The parties are awaiting rulings on the issues presented by the motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiffs and the motion to dismiss filed by Equifax and Naviant. Although Equifax believes it and Naviant have substantial factual and legal defenses to plaintiffs claims, we cannot at this time predict the probable outcome of this matter.
On August13, 2004, in a case captioned Equifax Inc. v. Austin Ventures VIII, L.P., et al., Equifax filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to preserve its claims against the shareholder sellers of Naviant pending the arbitration proceeding described above.
We are involved in other lawsuits, claims and proceedings as is normal in the ordinary course of our business. Any possible adverse outcome arising from these matters is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position, either individually or in the aggregate. However, our evaluation of the likely impact of these pending lawsuits could change in the future.
If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and can be estimated, we accrue a liability for estimated settlements and incurred but unpaid legal fees for services performed to date. In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
12. SALE OF INVESTMENT IN INTERSECTIONS INC.
On May5, 2004, Equifax, through its wholly owned subsidiary CD Holdings,Inc., completed the sale of 3,755,792 shares of common stock it owned in Intersections Inc., a provider of identity theft protection and credit management services, in an underwritten public offering of common stock for net proceeds of $59.4 million. Immediately prior to the public offering, CD Holdings converted a $20.0 million senior secured convertible note issued to it by Intersections in November2001 into 3,755,792 shares of Intersections common stock, or approximately 26.9% of Intersections outstanding stock. The book value of our investment in Intersections was $22.3 million, including accrued interest of $2.3 million. In the second quarter of 2004, we recorded, net of income taxes of $13.8 million, a net gain of $23.0 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We maintain lending, foreign exchange, debt underwriting, cash management, trust, investment management, acquisition valuation, derivative counterparty and shareholder services relationships with SunTrust Banks,Inc. (SunTrust) whom we consider a related party due to (a)L. Phillip Humann, a member of our board of directors, currently is the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust, and (b)Larry L. Prince, member of our board of directors, is a director of SunTrust. We paid SunTrust $2.8 million, $2.4million and $3.3million respectively during the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 for these services. We also provide credit management services to SunTrust, as a customer, from whom we received $4.3 million, $2.9million and $2.5million, respectively during the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, and had $0.3million and $0.2million of corresponding outstanding receivables with, as of at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our relationships with SunTrust are described more fully below:  On August20, 2004, Equifax entered into a new five-year $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. This facility replaced a prior $465.0 million revolving credit agreement which was composed of a $305.0 million multi-year portion, scheduled to expire on 80 October4, 2004, and a $160.0 million 364-day portion, which would have expired on September30, 2004. As of December31, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under the new $500.0 million credit facility. Borrowings outstanding under the prior $465.0 revolving credit facility totaled $137.1 million at December31, 2003.
SunTrust Bank (SunTrust), a subsidiary of SunTrust Banks,Inc., is the Administrative Agent for the aforementioned new $500.0 million revolving credit agreement, and also provides a $92.5 million committed portion of that facility. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, a division of SunTrust Capital Markets,Inc., served as Joint Lead Arranger of the new facility. SunTrust Capital Markets,Inc. is a subsidiary of SunTrust Banks,Inc. As of December31, 2003, SunTrust provided us a $100.0 committed portion of the prior $465.0 million U.S. revolving credit agreement. SunTrusts total commitment of $100.0 million at December31, 2003 was allocated 65.6% ($65.6 million) to the multi-year portion and 34.4% ($34.4 million) to the 364-day portion. Total borrowings outstanding under SunTrusts 364-day and multi-year portions of this facility were $29.5 million at December31, 2003.
SunTrust extends financing in the form of an amortizing term loan to a leveraged real estate limited partnership which owns our Atlanta data center located in Alpharetta, Georgia. We are the primary operating lease tenant in the data center. An unrelated bank leasing company is the equity owner of this partnership. Although this term loan is considered to be non-recourse financing to Equifax, SunTrust is dependent on the operating lease payments made by Equifax to the partnership to service interest expense and amortize principal on the term loans debt. The term loan is fully amortized in 2012. As of December31, 2004, and December31, 2003, $21.5million and $24.3 million, respectively, were outstanding under the term loan.
SunTrust provides the $29.0million synthetic lease facility related to our Atlanta corporate headquarters building. As of December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, the amount of this facility was $29.0million.
SunTrust provides investment management services for our USRIP through two of its subsidiaries, Trusco Capital and the Lighthouse Group. As of December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, a total of $48.4million and $37.6million, respectively, of USRIP assets were managed by these two subsidiaries of SunTrust.
During 2004 and 2003, SunTrust was the counterparty on $90.0million, notional value, of interest rate swaps with EquifaxInc.
Bank of America, N.A. (BofA), through its various subsidiaries, provides Equifax and our subsidiaries cash management, foreign exchange, lending and debt underwriting services. We consider BofA a related party because Jacquelyn M. Ward, a member of our board of directors, is also a director of BofA. We paid BofA $0.8 million, $0.8million and $2.0million respectively during the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 for these services. We also provide credit management services to BofA, as a customer, from whom we received $18.3 million, $15.3million and $11.2million, respectively during the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, and had $2.0million and $1.7million of corresponding outstanding receivables with, as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our relationships with BofA are described more fully below:  As of December31, 2003, and through the facilitys termination on August20, 2004, BofA served as the Administrative Agent on Equifax Inc.s $465.0 million revolving credit agreement, and provided a $100.0 committed portion of that facility. BofAs total commitment of $100.0 million at December31, 2003 was allocated 65.6% ($65.6 million) to the multi-year portion and 34.4% ($34.4 million) to the 364-day portion. Total borrowings outstanding under BofAs 364-day and multi-year portions of this facility were $29.5 million at December31, 2003.
81  BofA was the Syndication Agent for the new $500.0 million revolving credit agreement referenced above under SunTrust and executed in August2004, and also provides a $92.5 million committed portion of that facility. Banc of America Securities LLC, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, served as a Joint Lead Arranger of the new facility.
BofA extends an uncommitted $25.0million working capital line of credit to Equifax. The facility is cancelable at the discretion of either party. The uncommitted working capital line, at December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, had outstanding balances of $0.0million and $5.4million, respectively.
Bank of America Corporation provides investment management services for the USRIP through its subsidiary, Bank of America Capital Advisors, LLC. As of December31, 2004, a total of $5.2 million of USRIP assets was managed by this subsidiary.
At December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, BofA was the counterparty on $124.0million, notional value, of interest rate swaps with Equifax.
We sell telecommunication credit information reports and customer portfolio reviews to Certegy, Inc (Certegy). In addition Certegy provides customer invoice and disclosure notification printing/mailing services to us. We consider Certegy a related party because Lee A. Kennedy, a member of our board of directors, is also Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Certegy. Amounts paid to Certegy for fulfillment services were $9.2 million, $3.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002.

SEGMENT INFORMATION Our operations are organized into four reportable segments, with three primary reportable segments (i.e., Equifax North America, Equifax Europe and Equifax Latin America) dedicated to the marketing and selling of our core product lines (i.e., Information Services, Marketing Services and Personal Solutions) and related business operations within finite geographic regions. The fourth reportable segment (Other) pertains to an inactive product line. We also separately disclose the financial information pertaining to our divested operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in our summary of significant accounting and reporting policies (Note 1). We evaluate the performance of these segments based on their operating revenues, operating income and operating margins, excluding any unusual or infrequent items (if any). Inter-segment sales and transfers are not material. The measurement criteria for segment profit or loss and segment assets are substantially the same for each reportable segment. All transactions between segments are accounted for at cost, and no timing differences occur between segments.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of December 31, 2004.
No system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and procedures however are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Based on the evaluation discussed above, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were, as of the end of the period covered by this report, effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.
There were no changes in Equifaxs internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during Equifaxs fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Equifaxs internal control over financial reporting.
