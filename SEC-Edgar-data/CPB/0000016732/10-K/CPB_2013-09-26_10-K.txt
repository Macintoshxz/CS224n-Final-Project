Business The Company Campbell Soup Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (Campbell or the company), is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back to 1869. The companys principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.
Recent Developments On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of BF Bolthouse Holdco LLC (Bolthouse Farms) from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for $1.55 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments related to the amount of Bolthouse Farms cash, debt, working capital, transaction expenses and taxes.  Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added natural, healthy products. Bolthouse Farms has leading market positions in retail fresh carrots and super-premium beverages in the U.S. and Canada. Bolthouse Farms employs approximately 2,100 persons, and its two primary manufacturing facilities are company-owned and located in Bakersfield, California, and Prosser, Washington. Bolthouse Farms also leases agricultural property, which is primarily located in California. For additional information relating to the strategic rationale for the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview. The company funded the acquisition through a combination of short- and long-term borrowings. For additional information relating to the funding of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources. Since the Bolthouse Farms acquisition occurred subsequent to 2012, the results of Bolthouse Farms' operations are not included in this 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Report), and the discussion of the company's business and operations in this Report does not incorporate Bolthouse Farms' business and operations unless specifically stated otherwise.
On September 27, 2012, the company announced several initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network. The initiatives include closing the company's Sacramento, California, thermal plant, which produces soups, sauces and beverages, and the company's South Plainfield, New Jersey, spice plant, which supplies ingredients to the company's U.S. thermal plants. As a result of the initiatives, the company expects to incur pre-tax costs of approximately $115 million, most of which will be incurred in 2013. The company also expects to invest approximately $27 million in capital expenditures, primarily to relocate and refurbish a beverage filling and packaging line. For additional information relating to the initiatives, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reportable Segments The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and North America Foodservice. The company has 11 operating segments based on product type and geographic location and has aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics; products; production processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory environment. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The segments are discussed in greater detail below.
U.S. Simple Meals The U.S. Simple Meals segment aggregates the following operating segments: U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. The U.S. Soup retail business includes the following products: Campbells condensed and ready-to-serve soups; and Swanson broth and stocks. The U.S. Sauces retail business includes the following products: Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbells canned gravies, pasta, and beans; and Swanson canned poultry.
Global Baking and Snacking The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments: Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S. retail; and Arnotts biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific.
International Simple Meals and Beverages The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates the simple meals and beverages operating segments outside of the U.S., including Europe, the retail business in Canada, and the businesses in Asia Pacific, Latin America and China. The segments operations include Erasco and Heisse Tasse soups in Germany, Liebig and Royco soups in France, Devos Lemmens mayonnaise and cold sauces and Campbells and Royco soups in Belgium, and Bl Band soups and sauces in Sweden. In Canada, operations include Habitant and Campbells soups, Prego pasta sauces, Pace Mexican sauces, V8 juices and beverages and certain Pepperidge Farm products. In Asia Pacific, operations include Campbells soup and stock, Kimball sauces, V8 juices and beverages, 3 Prego pasta sauce and Swanson broths.
U.S. Beverages The U.S. Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail beverages business, including the following products: V8 juices and beverages and Campbells tomato juice.
North America Foodservice The North America Foodservice segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada.
Ingredients and Packaging The ingredient and packaging materials required for the manufacture of the companys food products are purchased from various suppliers. These items are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, energy costs, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements and regional drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price volatility, the company uses a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts and various commodity risk management tools for most of its ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At this time, the company does not anticipate any material restrictions on availability or shortages of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on the companys businesses. For information on the impact of inflation on the company, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Customers In most of the companys markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through the companys own sales force and its third-party broker and distributor partners. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America, the companys products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. In Europe, the companys products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the companys products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. The company makes shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders.
The company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 34% of the company's consolidated net sales in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 . The companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 17% of the companys consolidated net sales in 2012 and 2011 , and 18% in 2010 . All of the companys segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the companys consolidated net sales.
Trademarks and Technology As of September 14, 2012, the company owned over 4,200 trademark registrations and applications in over 165 countries, including the registrations acquired in the Bolthouse Farms acquisition. The company believes that its trademarks are of material importance to its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The company believes that its principal brands, including Campbells , Erasco , Liebig , Pepperidge Farm , Goldfish , V8 , Pace , Prego , Swanson , Royco and Arnotts , as well as the Bolthouse Farms brand acquired in the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. In addition, some of the companys products are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties.
Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Competition The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal products. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of generic and private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service.
4 Working Capital For information relating to the companys cash and working capital items, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Capital Expenditures During 2012 , the companys aggregate capital expenditures were $323 million . The company expects to spend approximately $330 million for capital projects in fiscal 2013 , including Bolthouse Farms projects. Major 2013 capital projects include a soup capacity expansion project for the North America Foodservice business, a cracker expansion project for Pepperidge Farm, the ongoing implementation of a series of related initiatives to simplify the soup-making process in North America (also known as the soup common platform initiative), the relocation and refurbishment of a U.S. beverage filling and packaging line, a packing automation project at one of the companys Australian biscuit plants, and the continued implementation of an advanced planning system in North America.
Research and Development During the last three fiscal years, the companys expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were $125 million in 2012 , $129 million in 2011 , and $123 million in 2010 . The decrease from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and other factors, partially offset by higher costs associated with product innovation in North America and the Asia Pacific region and inflation. The increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to costs associated with an ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America, costs associated with product innovation in North America, costs associated with a global baked snacks initiative, and the impact of currency, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. In fiscal 2013, the company expects to conduct much of its baking and snacking portfolio-related research and development at its new Pepperidge Farm innovation center, as well as its existing Arnott's innovation center.
Environmental Matters The company has requirements for the operation and design of its facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of the companys $323 million in capital expenditures made during 2012 , approximately $8 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. The company further estimates that approximately $18 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2013 will be for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations. The company believes that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company. In addition, the company continues to monitor pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these pending laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, the company does not believe that compliance with these pending laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.
Seasonality Demand for the companys products is somewhat seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the companys soup products. Demand for the companys sauce, beverage, baking and snacking products, however, is generally evenly distributed throughout the year.
Employees On July29, 2012 , there were approximately 17,700 employees of the company. In addition, as of July 29, 2012, Campbell Swire, the company's joint venture in China, employed approximately 170 persons.
Financial Information Financial information for the companys reportable segments and geographic areas is found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks attendant to the companys foreign operations, see Risk Factors.

5 Item 1A.
Risk Factors In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the companys business operations and financial condition.
The company operates in a highly competitive industry The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and experiences international competition in all of its principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of the company's primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the company's marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.
The company's results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company's products, including new or improved product and packaging introductions The company's results are dependent on successful marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company's products. The company's new or improved product and packaging introductions, along with its other marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new or improved products or packaging to address them. While the company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not be successful in developing new or improved products or packaging, or its new or improved products or packaging may not be accepted by customers or consumers.
Disruption to the company's supply chain could adversely affect its business Damage or disruption to the company's manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of the company's suppliers or contract manufacturers, whether as a result of adverse weather conditions (such as drought, temperature extremes or floods), natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, or other events, could impair the company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products. In addition, as part of the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, the company acquired a significant U.S. producer of fresh carrots. The production of carrots may be adversely impacted by the events listed above, as well as by water scarcity, crop disease and crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
The company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions Customer and consumer demand for the company's products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity  market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact the company's ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company.
The company may be adversely impacted by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions, such as the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, or divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends, in part, upon the company's ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and other benefits. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges or increase the company's exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and  risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, success is also dependent on effectively and efficiently separating the divested unit or business from the company and reducing or eliminating associated overhead costs. In cases where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted.
Increased regulation could adversely affect the company's business or financial results The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of the company's food products, as well as the health and safety of the company's employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well 6 as various state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. and by voluntary organizations, such as the National Advertising Division and the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed requirements designed to restrict food marketing), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the company's results The company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.dollar, primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and the euro. The company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.dollars, and therefore the company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S.dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S.dollar may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.
The company's results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials The raw and packaging materials used in the company's business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change), import and export requirements and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity.
Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace The company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of some of its products. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the company's business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
The company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores and club stores, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If the company is unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Also, during 2012, the company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 34% of the company's consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 17% of the company's consolidated net sales. The disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of the company's other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
The company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to its defined benefit pension plans The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the company's defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the company's obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company.
The company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, its information technology systems Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars involved is so significant, the company's information technology resources (some of which are managed by third parties) must provide connections among its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting functions. If the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to maintain the related computerized and manual control processes, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches (including the theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other system failures. If the company is unable to prevent such failures, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted.
7 The company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology or other initiatives The company's success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution of its products, which is necessary in the company's highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting functions.
The company's results may be impacted negatively by political conditions in the countries where the company does business The company has operations or does business in multiple countries. Because of its international reach, the company's performance may be impacted negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions, in these countries. The company may also be impacted by political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities and terrorist acts in these countries.
If the company's food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items, and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured The company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the company's reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the company's products. In addition, the company's results could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the company's products, ingredients or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case.
The company's results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brands The company has a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the company's business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company's ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about the company's products (whether or not valid), the company's failure to maintain the quality of its products, the failure of the company's products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about the company, its brands or products on social or digital media could seriously damage the company's brands and reputation.  If the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands, the company's results could be negatively impacted.

Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Description of the Company Campbell Soup Company is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and North America Foodservice.
Key Strategies Campbell's long-term goal is to drive profitable net sales growth as a means to deliver attractive, sustainable total shareowner returns. To grow net sales, the company is focused on expanding its brand and product platforms in three core categories -- simple meals, healthy beverages and baked snacks. Its plans are designed to tap into segments and adjacencies with high-growth profiles and strong prospects for growth within these categories. Three strategies guide this effort:  Stabilize and then profitably grow the company's North America soup and simple meals business.
Expand the company's international presence.
Continue to drive growth in the company's healthy beverages and baked snacks businesses.
By reducing less profitable promotional support and increasing consumer brand building in 2012, Campbell took steps towards stabilizing the profitability of its soup and simple meals business in North America. In 2013, the company is increasing its pipeline of consumer-driven innovation by expanding its product platforms and packaging formats to reach new consumers and new usage occasions. To this end, the company will introduce more than 50 new products in 2013 -- ranging from new varieties of Chunky ready-to-eat soups and Campbell's condensed soups to new products under the Campbell's Go platform and new sauces under the Campbell's Skillet Sauces brand. In addition to its innovation offerings, the company plans to increase its focus on other important growth drivers, such as product positioning, taste, availability, merchandising and price, to strengthen and grow its core soup and simple meals business portfolio in North America.
Campbell plans to expand its presence in international markets by extending product platforms in its current businesses, pursuing growth opportunities in faster-growing emerging markets, and expanding its export businesses in both existing and new geographies. The company's strategy for emerging market growth is likely to be centered on external development, ranging from acquisitions to strategic alliances such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships. Investments in its business in the People's Republic of China, where the company has a majority stake in a joint venture with Swire Pacific Limited, are expected to continue in 2013.
In Campbell's healthy beverages business, the company will continue the U.S. expansion of its V8 V-Fusion beverages into faster growing segments and channels, such as sparkling and energy beverages, teas and juice boxes. It will invest to revitalize the V8 100% vegetable juice franchise in the U.S. by reengaging both current and lapsed users with a new advertising campaign and new varieties. In the international beverage business, the company expects to attract new users in its Asia Pacific business through product improvements, such as the conversion from glass to PET packaging, and to further accelerate beverage growth in its Latin American business.
14 In Campbell's baked snacks portfolio, the company is increasing its focus on innovation while further enhancing collaboration between its Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's divisions to leverage new product ideas between these powerful brands. Pepperidge Farm will continue to drive growth in its very successful Goldfish brand, along with its savory cracker, cookie and bakery products. At Arnott's in Australia, the focus remains on innovation in sweet and savory biscuits, along with further development of products designed to address the light lunch eating occasion.
The Bolthouse Farms acquisition provides the company with a new growth platform within its portfolio. As previously discussed, Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added natural, healthy products. Bolthouse Farms' U.S. and Canadian market-leading super-premium refrigerated beverages complement the company's successful V8 beverage business, and Bolthouse Farms' leading U.S. and Canadian market position in fresh carrots anchors its business and provides significant cash flow. In addition, Bolthouse Farms' prominent position in the high-growth packaged fresh category augments the company's existing chilled soup business in North America, and offers opportunities for expansion into adjacent packaged fresh segments that respond directly to significant consumer trends.
Executive Summary This Executive Summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
Net sales were $7.707 billion in 2012, comparable to a year ago.
Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 38.8% from 40.2% a year ago.
Net earnings per share were $2.41 in 2012 , compared to $2.42 in 2011 . The current year included $.03 per share of expense from items that impacted comparability. The prior year included $.12 per share of expense from items that impacted comparability, as discussed below.
Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2012 Compared with 2011 The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and earnings per share:  In 2011, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its intent to exit the Russian market. In 2012, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $10 million ( $6 million after tax or $.02 per share) related to the initiatives.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $63 million ( $41 million after tax or $.12 per share) related to the initiatives.  See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges" for additional information; and  In 2012, the company recorded pre-tax transaction costs of $5 million ($3 million after tax or $.01 per share) related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms.
The items impacting comparability are summarized below: 2012 2011 Earnings Impact EPS Impact Earnings Impact EPS Impact (Millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings $ 774 $ 2.41 $ 805 $ 2.42 Restructuring charges $ (6 ) $ (.02 ) $ (41 ) $ (.12 ) Acquisition transaction costs (3 ) (.01 )   Impact of items on net earnings $ (9 ) $ (.03 ) $ (41 ) $ (.12 ) Net earnings were $774 million ( $2.41 per share) in 2012 , compared to $805 million ( $2.42 per share) in 2011 .  After adjusting for items impacting comparability, net earnings decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin percentage partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.   Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which was primarily due to share repurchases under the companys strategic share repurchase programs.
Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests The company owns a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture formed with Swire Pacific Limited to support the development of the companys business in China. The joint venture began operations on January 31, 2011, the beginning of the third quarter of 2011. The noncontrolling interests share in the net loss was included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
The company also owns a 70% controlling interest in a Malaysian food products manufacturing company.  Historically, the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were less than $1 million annually and, prior to the third quarter of 2011, were 15 included in Other expenses/(income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The earnings were not material in 2012 and in 2011 .
Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2011 Compared with 2010 In addition to the 2011 item that impacted comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share previously disclosed, the following items also impacted comparability:  In the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million ($8million after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs related to the 2008 initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term profitability. See Note6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Restructuring Charges for additional information; and  In the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded deferred tax expense of $10million, or $.03 per share, to reduce deferred tax assets as a result of the U.S. health care legislation enacted in March 2010.  The law changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees.
The items impacting comparability are summarized below: 2011 2010 Earnings Impact EPS Impact Earnings Impact EPS Impact (Millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings $ 805 $ 2.42 $ 844 $ 2.42 Restructuring charges $ (41 ) $ (.12 ) $ (8 ) $ (.02 ) Deferred tax expense from U.S. health care legislation   (10 ) (.03 ) Impact of items on net earnings $ (41 ) $ (.12 ) $ (18 ) $ (.05 ) Net earnings were $805 million ( $2.42 per share) in 2011 and $844 million ( $2.42 per share) in 2010 . After adjusting for the items impacting comparability, net earnings decreased in 2011 primarily due to a decline in gross margin percentage and lower sales volume, partly offset by lower marketing expenses and the impact of currency. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings per share increased in 2011 due to a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases under the company's strategic share repurchase program.

In 2012 , U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 1% . U.S. Soup declined 2% as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices, reflecting a continued cautious consumer environment. Further details of U.S. Soup include:  Sales of Campbells condensed soups increased 1% due to gains in eating varieties as cooking varieties were comparable to a year ago.
Sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 7%.  Ready-to-serve soup volumes were impacted by the company's shift to improve price realization through higher selling prices and reduced promotional spending.  The introduction of Campbells Slow Kettle soups in July 2011 positively impacted sales performance.
Broth sales increased 3% primarily due to volume gains and the introduction of Swanson Flavor Boost concentrated broth, which launched in July 2011.
U.S. Sauces sales increased slightly as gains in Prego pasta sauces were mostly offset by declines in sales of Pace Mexican sauces and other simple meal products. Sales of Pace Mexican sauces  were negatively impacted by increased private label competitive activity. In U.S. Sauces, promotional spending was increased to improve marketplace performance.
In 2011 , U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 6% . U.S.soup sales decreased 6% reflecting an overall weak economy; a challenging competitive environment in the U.S.food industry; changes in buying patterns among U.S.shoppers, particularly in stock up purchase behavior; and lower levels of product innovation. In this retail environment, the companys high levels of promotional support during the first half of the year did not deliver anticipated volume gains.
Sales of Campbells condensed soups declined 4% primarily due to declines in eating varieties. Sales of eating varieties were negatively impacted by promotional discounting in ready-to-serve soups.
Sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 9% with declines in both canned and microwavable varieties.
Broth sales decreased 1%.
In 2011, sales of Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces declined due to increased competitive activities.
In 2012 , Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 2% as  sales growth in Pepperidge Farm was partially offset by a decline in Arnott's. Sales at Pepperidge Farm reflected higher selling prices across the product portfolio, partly offset by increased promotional spending. Sales increased at double-digit rates in Goldfish snack crackers, and declined in cookies and frozen products. Sales at Arnott's declined reflecting an increase in promotional spending as the business was impacted by a difficult customer and consumer environment.
In 2011 , Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 9% as both Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts achieved volume gains and also benefited from higher selling prices. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily due to growth in Goldfish snack crackers and 17 bakery products, including whole-grain bread. In Arnotts, sales increased primarily due to currency, as well as gains in Shapes , Cruskits , and Vita-Weat savory crackers, and chocolate biscuits.
In 2012 , International Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 4% .  In Europe, sales declined primarily due to currency and declines in Germany. In Canada, sales declined primarily due to lower soup sales and the impact of currency. Promotional spending was increased within the segment to improve marketplace performance.
In 2011 , International Simple Meals and Beverages sales increased 3% , primarily due to currency. In Europe, sales declined due to currency. In Asia Pacific, sales increased primarily due to currency and volume-driven gains in Australia. In Canada, sales increased due to currency and volume gains, partially offset by increased promotional spending on soup products to be more competitive with other simple meal products. Sales in Latin America declined.
In 2012 , U.S. Beverages sales increased 2% . Sales of V8 Splash beverages and V8 V-Fusion beverages increased, while sales of V8 vegetable juice declined. Sales of V8 V-Fusion beverages benefited from a range of new products, including V8 V-Fusion Smoothies, Energy, Sparkling and juice boxes, as well as increased promotional support.
In 2011 , U.S. Beverages sales were comparable to 2010 as increased volume was offset by higher promotional spending. Promotional spending was increased to be more competitive with other beverages. Sales of V8 Splash beverages and V8 V-Fusion beverages increased, while sales of V8 vegetable juice declined.
In 2012 , North America Foodservice sales increased 3% primarily due to gains in refrigerated soup.
In 2011 , North America Foodservice sales increased 2% primarily due to gains in refrigerated soup.
Gross Profit Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, decreased by $111 million in 2012 from 2011 and decreased by $47 million in 2011 from 2010 . As a percent of sales, gross profit was 38.8% in 2012 , 40.2% in 2011 , and 41.0% in 2010 .
The 1.4 -percentage-point decrease in gross margin percentage in 2012 was due to the following factors: Margin Impact Cost inflation and other factors (3.7) Higher level of promotional spending (0.8) Mix (0.7) Higher selling prices 2.0 Productivity improvements 1.8 (1.4) The 0.8 -percentage-point decrease in gross margin percentage in 2011 was due to the following factors: Margin Impact Cost inflation and other factors, including higher plant costs (2.2) Higher level of promotional spending (0.7) Mix (0.2) Productivity improvements 1.9 Higher selling prices 0.4 (0.8) Marketing and Selling Expenses Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 13.2% in 2012 , 13.0% in 2011 , and 13.8% in 2010. Marketing and selling expenses increased 1% in 2012 from 2011 . The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 1 percentage point) and higher other marketing expenses (approximately 1percentage point), partly offset by lower selling expenses (approximately 1 percentage point). Advertising and consumer promotion expenses increased 3% in 2012 from 2011 , reflecting brand-building investments across many key brands. Marketing and selling expenses decreased 5% in 2011 from 2010 . The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising expenses (approximately 3percentage points); lower selling expenses (approximately 2percentage points); and lower other marketing expenses (approximately 2percentage points), partly offset by the impact of currency (approximately 2percentage points).
18 Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.9% in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 . Administrative expenses were comparable in 2012 and 2011 , as cost savings from restructuring initiatives and other factors (approximately 5 percentage points) were offset by higher compensation and benefit costs (approximately 2 percentage points) and higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 3 percentage points). Administrative expenses increased by 1% in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in pension and health care benefit costs (approximately 2percentage points); the impact of currency (approximately 2percentage points); and costs associated with the corporate headquarters facility (approximately 1percentage point), partially offset by lower compensation costs (approximately 2percentage points) and cost management efforts and other factors (approximately 2percentage points).
Research and Development  Expenses Research and development expenses decreased $4 million or 3% in 2012 from 2011 . The decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and other factors (approximately 6 percentage points), partially offset by higher costs associated with product innovation in North America and the Asia Pacific region (approximately 2 percentage points), and inflation (approximately 1 percentage point). Research and development expenses increased $6 million or 5% in 2011 from 2010 . The increase was primarily due to costs associated with an ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process and product innovation in North America (approximately 2 percentage points); costs associated with a global baked snacks initiative (approximately 2 percentage points), and the impact of currency (approximately 2 percentage points), partly offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point).
Other Expenses/(Income) Other expense in 2012 included a $3 million impairment charge associated with the Bl Band trademark  used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.  The charge was recorded as a result of the company's annual review of intangible assets. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense in 2012 also included $5 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms.  See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other expense in 2011 included a $3 million impairment charge associated with the Heisse Tasse trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings decreased 8% in 2012 from 2011 and decreased 1% in 2011 from 2010 .
An analysis of operating earnings by segment follows: %Change 2012 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 (Millions) U.S. Simple Meals $ 658 $ 657 $ 737  (11) Global Baking and Snacking 315 355 322 (11) 10 International Simple Meals and Beverages 153 185 161 (17) 15 U.S. Beverages 134 182 206 (26) (12) North America Foodservice 85 82 55 4 49 1,345 1,461 1,481 (8) (1) Unallocated corporate expenses (123 ) (119 ) (121 ) Restructuring charges(1) (10 ) (63 ) (12 ) Earnings before interest and taxes $ 1,212 $ 1,279 $ 1,348 __________________________________________ (1) See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.
Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals in 2012 and 2011 were comparable, as earnings gains in U.S. Soup were mostly offset by declines in U.S. Sauces. For the segment, higher selling prices, productivity improvements and lower promotional spending were mostly offset by lower volumes and cost inflation.
Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals decreased 11% in 2011 versus 2010 . The decline was primarily due to lower sales and a reduced gross margin percentage, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. In the first half of 2011 , in response to the overall competitive environment, the company maintained higher levels of promotional support, which did not deliver anticipated volume gains.
19 Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking decreased 11% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and higher advertising expense, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Promotional spending was increased to support the businesses.
Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased 10% in 2011 versus 2010 . The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and volume-driven growth in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts.
Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 17% in 2012 versus 2011 . The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower earnings in the Asia Pacific region and Canada, and increased costs associated with the company's market expansion in China.
Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages increased 15% in 2011 versus 2010 . The increase was primarily due to growth in the Asia Pacific region, the impact of currency and reduced investment in Russia.
Earnings from U.S. Beverages decreased 26% primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and advertising expense, partly offset by productivity improvements.
Earnings from U.S. Beverages decreased 12% in 2011 versus 2010 primarily due to increased promotional spending.
Earnings from North America Foodservice increased 4% due to higher selling prices and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation.
Earnings from North America Foodservice increased to $82 million in 2011 from $55 million in 2010 primarily due to reduced promotional spending, productivity improvements in excess of inflation, and lower administrative expense.
Interest Expense/Income Interest expense decreased to $114 million in 2012 from $122 million in 2011 , primarily due to lower interest rates on fixed-rate debt. Interest income decreased to $8 million in 2012 from $11 million in 2011 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest expense increased to $122 million in 2011 from $112 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase in fixed-rate debt and higher debt levels. Interest income increased to $11 million in 2011 from $6 million in 2010 primarily due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.
Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 30.9% in 2012 , 31.3% in 2011 , and 32.0% in 2010 . The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to lower tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2012.
The reduction in the effective tax rate in 2011 from 2010 was primarily due to $10million of deferred tax expense recognized in 2010 as a result of the enactment of U.S.health care legislation. The law changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees. The company recorded the adjustment to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset associated with the subsidy.
Restructuring Charges 2011 Initiatives On June28, 2011, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its intent to exit the Russian market.

This investment will occur through the second quarter of 2013 and will result in the elimination of approximately 190 positions. Further, the company improved asset utilization in the U.S. by shifting production of ready-to-serve soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012. In addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was closed in 2011, and manufacturing of Campbells Soup at Hand microwavable products was consolidated at the Maxton, North Carolina, plant in 2012.
The company streamlined its salaried workforce by approximately 510 positions around the world, including approximately 130 positions at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. These actions were substantially completed in 2011.

A summary 20 of the pre-tax charges and remaining costs associated with the initiatives is as follows: (Millions) Total Program Recognized as of July 29, 2012 Remaining Costs to be Recognized Severance pay and benefits $ 43 $ (41 ) $ 2 Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 23 (23 )  Other exit costs 9 (9 )  Total $ 75 $ (73 ) $ 2 Of the aggregate $75 million of pre-tax costs, the company expects approximately $50 million will be cash expenditures, the majority of which was spent in 2012. In addition, the company expects to invest approximately $40 million in capital expenditures in connection with the actions, of which approximately $18 million has been invested as of July 29, 2012. The remaining cash outflows related to these programs are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity. The initiatives are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.
The initiatives included in this program are expected to generate annual pre-tax cash savings of approximately $60 million beginning in 2012 and increasing to approximately $70million in 2014.
The total pre-tax costs of $75 million associated with each segment are expected to be as follows: U.S. Simple Meals $32 million ; Global Baking and Snacking $15 million ; International Simple Meals and Beverages $18 million ; U.S. Beverages $3 million ; North America Foodservice $1 million ; and Corporate $6 million . Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges as segment performance is evaluated excluding such charges.
2008 Initiatives On  April28, 2008, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company's management structure.
As a result of these initiatives, in 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million ($8million after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs associated with the 2008 initiatives. These costs related to the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.

23 MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 30% of 2012 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Belgium. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. Cross-currency swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.
The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, aluminum, wheat, natural gas and cocoa, which impact the cost of raw materials.

The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on the companys overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly 26 or annual financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
Valuation of long-lived assets Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.  As of July29, 2012 , the carrying value of goodwill was $2.013 billion . The company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the 2012 measurement, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 45%. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2012 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value. As of July29, 2012 , the carrying value of trademarks was $485 million. In 2012 , as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized related to the Bl Band trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.  As of July29, 2012 , certain European trademarks have a carrying value of approximately $40 million , which approximates fair value. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2012 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of all trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately $6 million .  In 2011, as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized related to the Heisse Tasse trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.
The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the companys control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
See also Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.
The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method.  Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is 27 amortized into earnings in the following year.
Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $102 million in 2012 , $98 million in 2011 , and $92 million in 2010 . The 2010 expense included $12 million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in Canada. Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Pension Discount rate for benefit obligations 4.05% 5.41% 5.46% Expected return on plan assets 7.65% 7.90% 8.15% Postretirement Discount rate for obligations 3.75% 5.00% 5.25% Initial health care trend rate 8.25% 8.25% 8.25% Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $18 million; a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $12 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million .
Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately $128 million in 2013 primarily due to increased amortization of unrecognized losses.
The company contributed $55 million and $100 million , respectively, to U.S. pension plans in 2012 and 2011 . Given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans, the company contributed $260 million to a U.S. plan in 2010. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were $16 million in 2012 , $44 million in 2011 , and $24 million in 2010 . The company contributed $75 million to U.S. plans in the first quarter of 2013. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not expected in 2013. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $13 million in 2013.
See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses.
Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Campbell Soup Company, together with its subsidiaries (the company), is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and entities in which the company maintains a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July31. There were 52 weeks in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 .
Use of Estimates Generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales promotion expenses, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupon redemption costs, are classified as a reduction of sales. The recognition of costs for promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Costs are recognized either upon sale or when the incentive is offered, based on the program.
Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
Inventories All inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods not exceeding 45 years and 20 years, respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in business climate or a plan of disposal. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.
Derivative Financial Instruments The company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee benefit obligations. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company's derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, shall be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated.
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, on the date the derivative contract is entered into, the company designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or 34 liability or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. If the underlying hedged item ceases to exist, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in earnings each period until the instrument matures. If a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of designated hedges is recognized in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.
Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities.
Advertising Production Costs Advertising production costs are expensed in the period that the advertisement first takes place.
Research and Development Costs The costs of research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and improvements to existing products and processes. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting, and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued additional authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The guidance requires a roll forward, separately presenting information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis, rather than net, of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2012. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance clarifying the required disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations. The guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2010.
In December 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill. The guidance clarifies the impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011. The company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In May 2011, the FASB issued further additional authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The company adopted the guidance in the third quarter of 2012.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring entities to present net income and other comprehensive income (OCI) in one continuous statement or two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and comprehensive income. The option to present items of OCI in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to defer indefinitely a requirement in the June 2011 standard that called for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to be measured and presented by income statement line item in net income and also in OCI.  The new requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2011, and for interim reporting periods within those years. The adoption will impact the presentation of financial statements and will not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In September 2011, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the 35 entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The company adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance related to disclosures about offsetting (netting) of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions that are offset in the statement of financial position, and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The scope includes financial instruments and derivative instruments. The disclosures are required for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Disclosures required under the guidance will be provided for all comparative periods presented. The adoption will impact disclosures and will not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.

Amortizable intangible assets consist substantially of process technology and customer intangibles. Amortization related to these assets was approximately $1 for 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 . The estimated aggregated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is less than $1 per year. Asset useful lives range from one to twenty years.
In 2012 , as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 was recognized related to the Bl Band trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of  a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows. In 2011 , as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 was recognized related to the Heisse Tasse trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows. The impairment charges were recorded in Other expenses/(income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of July 2012 , certain European trademarks have a carrying value of approximately $40 , which approximates fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. Actual cash flows could differ from management's estimates due to changes in business performance, operating performance, and economic conditions.

Business and Geographic Segment Information The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S.Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S.Beverages; and North America Foodservice. The company has 11 operating segments based on product type and geographic location and has aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics; products; production processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory environment. The segments are discussed in greater detail below.
The U.S.Simple Meals segment aggregates the following operating segments: U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. The U.S. Soup retail business includes the following products: Campbells condensed and ready-to-serve soups; and Swanson broth and stocks. The U.S. Sauces retail business includes the following products: Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbells canned gravies, pasta and beans; and Swanson canned poultry.
The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments: Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S.retail; and Arnotts biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific.
The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates the simple meals and beverages operating segments outside of the U.S., including Europe, the retail business in Canada, and the businesses in Asia Pacific, Latin America and China.
The U.S.Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail beverages business, including the following products: V8 juices and beverages; and Campbells tomato juice.
The North America Foodservice segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada.
The companys accounting policies for measuring segment assets and earnings before interest and taxes are substantially consistent with those described in Note 1. The company evaluates segment performance before interest, taxes and costs associated with restructuring activities. Beginning in 2012, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment operating earnings and are recorded in Corporate expenses as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases. Upon closing of the contracts, the realized gain or loss is transferred to segment operating earnings, which allows the segments to reflect the economic effects of the hedge without exposure to quarterly volatility of unrealized gains and losses. In prior periods, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedging activities were not material. Certain manufacturing, warehousing and 37 distribution  activities of the segments are integrated  in order to maximize efficiency and productivity.  As a result, asset information by segment is not discretely maintained for internal reporting or used in evaluating performance. Therefore, only geographic segment asset information is included in the disclosures.
The company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated net sales in 2012 and 2011 , and 18% in 2010 . All of the company's segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Restructuring Charges On June28, 2011, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its intent to exit the Russian market. Details of the initiatives include:  In Australia, the company will invest in a new system to automate packing operations at its biscuit plant in Virginia. This investment will occur through the second quarter of  2013 and will result in the elimination of approximately 190 positions. Further, the company improved asset utilization in the U.S. by shifting production of ready-to-serve soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012. In addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was closed in 2011, and manufacturing of Campbells Soup at Hand microwavable products was consolidated at the Maxton, North Carolina, plant in 2012.
The company streamlined its salaried workforce by approximately 510 positions around the world, including approximately 130 positions at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. These actions were substantially completed in 2011. As part of this initiative, the company outsourced a larger portion of its U.S. retail merchandising activities to its current retail sales agent, Acosta Sales and Marketing, and eliminated approximately 190 positions.
In connection with exiting the Russian market, the company has eliminated approximately 50 positions. The exit process commenced in 2011 and was substantially completed in 2012.
39 In 2012 , the company recorded a restructuring charge of $10 ( $6 after tax or $.02 per share) related to these initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $63 ( $41 after tax or $.12 per share). A summary of the pre-tax charges and remaining costs associated with the initiatives is as follows: Total Program Recognized as of July 29, 2012 Remaining Costs to be Recognized Severance pay and benefits $ 43 $ (41 ) $ 2 Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 23 (23 )  Other exit costs 9 (9 )  Total $ 75 $ (73 ) $ 2 Of the aggregate $75 of pre-tax costs, the company expects approximately $50 will be cash expenditures, the majority of which was spent in 2012. In addition, the company expects to invest approximately $40 in capital expenditures in connection with the actions, of which approximately $18 has been invested as of July 29, 2012. The initiatives are expected to be completed by the end of 2013.

Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges as segment performance is evaluated excluding such charges.
2008 Initiatives On  April28, 2008, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company's management structure.
As a result of these initiatives, in 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 ( $8 after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs associated with the 2008 initiatives. These costs related to the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.
40 Recent Development - 2013 Initiatives On September 27, 2012, the company announced several initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network. The initiatives include closing the company's Sacramento, California, thermal plant, which produces soups, sauces and beverages, and the company's South Plainfield, New Jersey, spice plant, which supplies ingredients to the company's U.S. thermal plants. As a result of the initiatives, the company expects to incur pre-tax costs of approximately $115 , most of which will be incurred in 2013. The company also expects to invest approximately $27 in capital expenditures, primarily to relocate and refurbish a beverage filling and packaging line. For additional information relating to the initiatives, see Note 19.

Earningsper Share The accounting guidance for earnings per share provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings.
The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareowners is as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company $ 774 $ 805 $ 844 Less: net earnings allocated to participating securities (5 ) (9 ) (14 ) Net earnings available to Campbell Soup Company common shareowners $ 769 $ 796 $ 830 Weighted average shares outstanding  basic 317 326 340 Effect of dilutive securities: stock options and other share-based payment awards 2 3 3 Weighted average shares outstanding  diluted 319 329 343 Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company per common share: Basic $ 2.43 $ 2.44 $ 2.44 Diluted $ 2.41 $ 2.42 $ 2.42 There were no antidilutive stock options in 2012 or 2011 . Stock options to purchase less than 1 million shares of capital stock in 2010 were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the stock options exceeded the average market price of the capital stock and, therefore, would be antidilutive.
8.
Noncontrolling Interests The company owns a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture formed with Swire Pacific Limited to support the development of the companys business in China. The joint venture began operations on January31, 2011, the beginning of the third quarter of  2011.  At the inception of the joint venture, the joint venture partner contributed net assets of $7 , including $9 of cash contributions, and the company made an $11 cash contribution. In July 2011, the company and joint venture partner contributed additional cash of $2 and $1 , respectively. In July 2012, the company and joint venture partner contributed additional cash of $3 and $2 , respectively. The noncontrolling interests share in the net loss was included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
The company owns a 70% controlling interest in a Malaysian food products manufacturing company. The earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest have historically been less than $1 annually and, prior to the third quarter of 2011, were included in Other expense/(income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Beginning in the third quarter of  2011, the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The earnings were not material in 2012 , 2011 , or 2010.
The noncontrolling interests in these entities were included in Total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension Benefits The company sponsors a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. In 1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continues to accrue for active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments through the year 2014. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the company from general funds. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the companys U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans.
Postretirement Benefits The company provides postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their dependents. The company established retiree medical account benefits for eligible U.S. retirees. The accounts were intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the retirement medical program was amended to eliminate the retiree medical account benefit for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. To preserve the benefit for employees close to retirement age, the retiree medical account will be available to employees who were at least age 50 with at least 10 years of service as of December 31, 2010, and who satisfy the other eligibility requirements for the retiree medical program.
The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for the benefit plans.

The remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with pension benefits were primarily due to net actuarial losses arising during the period and the impact of foreign currency.
The change in other comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits was due to the reclassification of actuarial losses into earnings of $9 and $7 in 2012 and 2011 . The remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits were primarily due to net actuarial losses arising during the period.
43 The following table provides information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: 2012 2011 Projected benefit obligation $ 2,739 $ 2,194 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 2,653 $ 2,131 Fair value of plan assets $ 2,114 $ 1,891 The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $ 2,657 at July29, 2012 and $ 2,299 at July31, 2011 .
Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the end of the year: Pension Postretirement 2012 2011 2012 2011 Discount rate 4.05 % 5.41 % 3.75 % 5.00 % Rate of compensation increase 3.31 % 3.31 % 3.25 % 3.25 % Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended: Pension 2012 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.41 % 5.46 % 6.00 % Expected return on plan assets 7.90 % 8.15 % 8.13 % Rate of compensation increase 3.31 % 3.29 % 3.29 % The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management.
The discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was 5.00% in 2012, 5.25% in 2011, and 6.00% in 2010.
Assumed health care cost trend rates at the end of the year: 2012 2011 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 8.25% 8.25% Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) 4.50% 4.50% Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2020 2019 A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care costs would have the following effects on 2012 reported amounts: Increase Decrease Effect on service and interest cost $ 1 $  Effect on the 2012 accumulated benefit obligation $ 35 $ (10 ) 44 Pension Plan Assets The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations.
The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to plan obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations.
The portfolio includes investments in the following asset classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives. Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the plans obligations. Equities are used for their high expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide diversification.
Asset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight.
The companys year-end pension plan weighted-average asset allocations by category were: Strategic Target 2012 2011 Equity securities 51% 48% 50% Debt securities 35% 36% 35% Real estate and other 14% 16% 15% Net periodic benefit expense 100% 100% 100% The company is required to categorize pension plan assets based on the following fair value hierarchy:  Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted)for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions.

Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as Level 1 at cost which approximates market value. Other investment vehicles are valued based upon a net asset value and are classified as Level 2.
Equities Common stocks and preferred stocks are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
Corporate bonds These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates.
Government and agency bonds These investments are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade data for identical or similar obligations.
Municipal bonds These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates.
Commingled funds Investments in commingled funds are classified as Level 2 assets as the funds are not traded in active markets. Commingled funds are valued based on the unit values of such funds. Unit values are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the funds derived from inputs principally based on quoted market prices in an active market or corroborated 46 by observable market data by correlation or other means. Blended commingled funds are invested in both equities and fixed income securities.
Mortgage and asset backed securities Fair value is based on prices obtained from third party pricing sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage backed securities are traded in the over-the-counter market.
Real estate Real estate investments consist of real estate investment trusts and property funds. Real estate investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether liquidity is limited or there are few observable market participant transactions. Fair value is based on third party appraisals.
Limited partnerships Investments in limited partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the general partners of the funds. The values of limited partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third parties, expected cash flows, and market-based information, including comparable transactions and performance multiples among other factors. The investments are classified as Level 3 since the valuation is determined using unobservable inputs.
Hedge funds Hedge fund investments include hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the fair value of underlying securities and are therefore classified as Level 2 assets. Hedge fund investments may include long and short positions in equity and fixed income securities, derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities, and other types of securities.
Guaranteed insurance contracts These assets are classified as Level 3 assets as they are valued using unobservable inputs. Guaranteed insurance contracts are valued based on the discounted stream of guaranteed benefit payments at a market rate increased for expected future profit sharing. The expected excess return is equal to expected indexation granted to participants. The discounted stream of guaranteed benefit payments is calculated based on the expected mortality rates of plan participants.
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included net accrued interest and dividends receivable, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and other payables.
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 investments for the years ended July29, 2012 and July31, 2011 : Real Estate Limited Partnerships Guaranteed Insurance Contracts Total Fair value at July 31, 2011 $ 19 $ 20 $  $ 39 Actual return on plan assets 2 2  4 Purchases     Sales (5 ) (3 )  (8 ) Settlements     Transfers out of Level 3     Fair value at July 29, 2012 $ 16 $ 19 $  $ 35 Real Estate Limited Partnerships Guaranteed Insurance Contracts Total Fair value at August 1, 2010 $ 18 $ 24 $ 8 $ 50 Actual return on plan assets 4 4 (2 ) 6 Purchases     Sales (3 ) (8 )  (11 ) Settlements   (6 ) (6 ) Transfers out of Level 3     Fair value at July 31, 2011 $ 19 $ 20 $  $ 39 A contribution of $75 was made to U.S. pension plans in the first quarter of 2013 .

Taxes on Earnings The provision for income taxes on earnings consists of the following: 2012 2011 2010 Income taxes: Currently Payable Federal $ 213 $ 215 253 State 29 27 46 Non-U.S.
55 78 45 297 320 344 Deferred Federal 37 47 38 State 2 (2 ) 1 Non-U.S.

184 224 191 $ 1,106 $ 1,168 $ 1,242 48 The following is a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate: 2012 2011 2010 Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes (net of federal tax benefit) 1.9 1.4 2.5 Tax effect of international items (3.8 ) (2.1 ) (2.5 ) Settlement of tax contingencies (0.1 ) (0.5 ) (0.7 ) Federal manufacturing deduction (1.8 ) (1.8 ) (1.3 ) Other (0.3 ) (0.7 ) (1.0 ) Effective income tax rate 30.9 % 31.3 % 32.0 % In 2011, the company recorded a tax benefit of $8 following the finalization of tax audits.
In the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded deferred tax expense of $10 due to the enactment of U.S. health care legislation in March 2010. The law changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees. Accordingly, the company recorded the non-cash charge to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset associated with the subsidy.
In 2010, the company recorded a tax benefit of $9 following the finalization of tax audits. The company recorded an additional tax benefit of $2 during the year related to the resolution of other tax contingencies.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: 2012 2011 Depreciation $ 279 $ 253 Amortization 474 474 Other 20 14 Deferred tax liabilities 773 741 Benefits and compensation 311 307 Pension benefits 194 93 Tax loss carryforwards 69 84 Capital loss carryforwards 117 122 Other 79 83 Gross deferred tax assets 770 689 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance (142 ) (156 ) Net deferred tax assets 628 533 Net deferred tax liability $ 145 $ 208 At July29, 2012 , U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company have tax loss carryforwards of approximately $317 . Of these carryforwards, $106 expire between 2013 and 2028 , and $211 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax rates in these countries range from 15% to 35% . At July29, 2012 , deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established to offset $83 of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, at July29, 2012 , non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $388 , which were fully offset by valuation allowances. U.S. subsidiaries of the company had a capital loss carryforward of $2 which expires in 2017 for which no valuation allowance had been established.
The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2012 was a decrease of $14 . The decrease was primarily due to the discontinuation of the company's Russian operations as well as the impact of currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign  loss carryforwards. The net change in the valuation allowance in 2011 was an increase of $33 . The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards.  The net change in the valuation allowance in 2010 was an increase of $15 . The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards that are not expected to be utilized prior to the expiration date.
As of July29, 2012 , Other deferred tax assets include $3 of foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire in 2022 , and $3 of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire between 2014 and 2021 . No valuation allowances have been established related to these deferred tax assets.
As of July29, 2012 , U.S. income taxes have not been provided on approximately $561 of undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
49 subsidiaries, which are deemed to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.
A reconciliation of the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits follows: 2012 2011 2010 Balance at beginning of year $ 43 $ 36 $ 42 Increases related to prior-year tax positions 2 6 14 Decreases related to prior-year tax positions (1 ) (4 ) (11 ) Increases related to current-year tax positions 9 9 4 Settlements   (11 ) Lapse of statute (5 ) (4 ) (2 ) Balance at end of year $ 48 $ 43 $ 36 As of July29, 2012 , July31, 2011 , and August1, 2010 , there were $18 , $17 , and $22 , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The company believes it is reasonably possible that settlement may be reached in the next 12 months on certain state matters resulting in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $17 .
The companys accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was not material in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $8 as of July29, 2012 , and July31, 2011 .
Approximately $6 of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, was reported as accrued taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July29, 2012 .  Approximately $50 and $51 of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, were reported as other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July29, 2012 and July31, 2011 , respectively.
The company does business internationally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the U.S., Australia, Canada, Belgium, France and Germany. The 2012 tax year is currently under audit by the IRS. The 2008 and 2009 tax years are currently under audit by Canada. In addition, several state income tax examinations are in progress for fiscal years 2001 to 2011.
With limited exceptions, the company has been audited for income tax purposes in Canada and Germany through fiscal year 2007, in France through fiscal year 2008, and in Belgium and Australia through fiscal year 2009.

Financial Instruments The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, the company follows established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, options, forwards and commodity futures. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The companys derivative programs include both instruments that qualify and that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Concentration of Credit Risk The company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate  counterparty credit risk, the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected, leading credit-worthy financial institutions, and distributes contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. The company does not have credit-risk-related contingent features in its derivative instruments as of July29, 2012 .  During 2012, the company's largest customer accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated net sales.  The company closely monitors credit risk associated with counterparties and customers.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Swedish krona, New Zealand dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts as well as cross-currency swaps to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. The company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to 18 months. To hedge 51 currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. As of July29, 2012 , cross-currency swap contracts mature in 2013 through 2015 . The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $156 at July29, 2012 and $287 at July31, 2011 . The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on the same line item and the same period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $908 and $861 at July29, 2012 and July31, 2011 , respectively.
Interest Rate Risk The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay variable rate interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair-value hedges. The notional amount of outstanding fair-value interest rate swaps totaled $500 at July29, 2012 and at July31, 2011 . These swaps mature in 2013 through 2014 . The company manages its exposure to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. Pay variable rate/receive fixed rate forward starting interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash-flow hedges.  The notional amount of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps totaled $600 at July29, 2012 .  These swaps mature in 2013 through 2015 .
Commodity Price Risk The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, aluminum, wheat, natural gas and cocoa, which impact the cost of raw materials. Commodity futures, options, and swap contracts are either accounted for as cash-flow hedges or are not designated as accounting hedges. The company hedges a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to 12 months. There were no commodity contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges at July29, 2012 . The notional amount of commodity contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges at July31, 2011 was $6 . The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was $95 at July29, 2012 and $81 at July31, 2011 .
Equity Price Risk The company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the companys capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index and, beginning in April 2012, the total return of the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the total return on company capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index; or the total return of the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index. These contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are entered into for periods typically not exceeding 12 months. The notional amounts of  the contracts as of July29, 2012 and July31, 2011 were $75 and $71 , respectively.

Fair Value Measurements The company is required to categorize financial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:  Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted)for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions.
Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted 54 market prices to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, the company bases fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for credit and nonperformance risk.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents the companys financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July29, 2012 , and July31, 2011 , consistent with the fair value hierarchy: Fair Value as of July 29, 2012 FairValueMeasurementsat July 29, 2012 Using Fair Value Hierarchy FairValue as of July31, 2011 FairValueMeasurementsat July31, 2011 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Interest rate swaps(1) $ 13 $  $ 13 $  $ 33 $  $ 33 $  Forward starting interest rate swaps(1) 2  2      Foreign exchange forward  contracts(2) 2  2      Cross-currency swap contracts(3) 19  19  1  1  Commodity derivative contracts(5) 8 8   3 3   Deferred compensation derivative contracts(4) 1  1      Total assets at fair value $ 45 $ 8 $ 37 $  $ 37 $ 3 $ 34 $  Fair Value as of July 29, 2012 FairValueMeasurementsat July 29, 2012 Using Fair Value Hierarchy FairValue as of July31, 2011 FairValueMeasurementsat July31, 2011 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Level1 Level2 Level3 Level1 Level2 Level3 Liabilities Foreign exchange forward  contracts(2) $  $  $  $  $ 9 $  $ 9 $  Cross-currency swap contracts(3) 79  79  129  129  Deferred compensation derivative contracts(4)     3  3  Commodity derivative contracts(5) 4 4   2 2   Deferred compensation obligation(6) 109 109   144 97 47  Total liabilities at fair value $ 192 $ 113 $ 79 $  $ 287 $ 99 $ 188 $  ____________________________________ (1) Based on LIBOR swap rates.

(5) Based on quoted futures exchanges.
(6) Based on the fair value of the participants investments.
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the company is also required to measure certain items at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. In 2012 and 2011, as  part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 was recognized on trademarks used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Fair value was determined based on unobservable Level 3 inputs. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates.
The following table presents the companys fair value measurements of intangible assets that were recognized in the years ended July29, 2012 , and July31, 2011 , respectively, consistent with the fair value hierarchy: 2012 2011 Impairment Fair Value Impairment Fair Value Intangible assets Bl Band $ 3 $ 20 $  $  Heisse Tasse $  $  $ 3 $ 11 The company also recognized $22 of asset impairment/accelerated depreciation in 2011 associated with the restructuring initiatives described in Note 6.  The carrying value of the assets was reduced to estimated fair value, which was not material.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial instruments, other than those presented in the disclosures above, include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short- and long-term borrowings. The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, approximate fair value.
Cash equivalents of $80 at July29, 2012 and $35 at July31, 2011 represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. Fair value of cash equivalents is based on Level 2 inputs.
The fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt in Short-term borrowings, was $2,663 at July29, 2012 and $2,603 at July31, 2011 . The carrying value was $2,408 at July29, 2012 and $2,427 at July31, 2011 . The fair value of long-term debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively over a three-year period at a rate of 30% , 60% and 100% , respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant.
Pursuant to the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in July 2005 the company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareowner return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, and time-lapse restricted stock/units. Initial grants made in accordance with this program were approved in September 2005. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing the companys total shareowner return during a three-year period to the respective total shareowner returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon the companys ranking in the performance peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 225% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units will be earned based upon the companys achievement of annual earnings per share goals. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 100% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, the company may issue special grants of time-lapse restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest ratably over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October. Annual stock option grants are not part of the long-term incentive compensation program for 2010, 2011 or 2012. However, stock options may still be granted on a selective basis under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans.
In fiscal 2012, the company issued time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units and, for the first time, strategic performance restricted stock units. The company did not issue TSR performance restricted stock units in fiscal 2012. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units will be earned based upon the achievement of net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a two-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant.
Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was $79 for 2012 , $87 for 2011 , and $88 for 2010 . Tax-related benefits of $29 were recognized for 2012 , $32 were recognized for 2011 , and $33 were recognized for 2010 .

Time-lapse restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS performance restricted stock units are expensed on a graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. There were approximately 300 thousand EPS performance target grants outstanding at July29, 2012 with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $33.56 . Strategic performance restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. There were approximately 1.28 million strategic performance target grants outstanding at July29, 2012 with a grant-date fair value of $32.37 . The actual number of EPS performance restricted stock units and strategic performance restricted stock units issued at the vesting date could range from 0% to 100% and 0% to 200% , respectively, of the initial grant, depending on actual performance achieved. Expense is estimated based on the number of awards expected to vest.
On July1, 2011, the company issued approximately 400 thousand special retention time-lapse restricted stock units to certain executives to support successful execution of the companys shift in strategic direction and leadership transition. These awards vest over a two-year period and are included in the table above. The grant-date fair value was $34.65 .
As of July29, 2012 , total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units and strategic performance restricted stock units was $48 , which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.5 years. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 was $38 , $40 , and $32 , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during 2011 and 2010 was $35.64 and $32.25 , respectively.
The following table summarizes TSR performance restricted stock units activity: Units Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value (Restrictedstock unitsinthousands) Nonvested at July 31, 2011 3,431 $ 40.78 Granted  $  Vested  $  Forfeited (1,288 ) $ 45.50 Nonvested at July 29, 2012 2,143 $ 37.94 The company estimated the fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. Assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation were as follows: 2011 2010 Risk-free interest rate 0.59 % 1.27 % Expected dividend yield 3.00 % 3.06 % Expected volatility 23.71 % 24.83 % Expected term 3 yrs.

58 Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period.  As of July29, 2012 , total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock units was $17 , which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.0 year. In the first quarter of 2012, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned 0% of the initial grants based upon the companys TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July29, 2011. The total fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units vested during 2011 and 2010 was $38 and $31 , respectively. The grant-date fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2011 and 2010 was $43.18 and $33.84 , respectively. There were no TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2012 .  In the first quarter of 2013, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units will receive 0% of the initial grant based upon the company's TSR ranking in a performance peer group during the three-year period ended July 27, 2012.
Prior to fiscal 2009, employees could elect to defer all types of restricted stock awards. These awards were classified as liabilities because of the possibility that they may be settled in cash. The fair value was adjusted quarterly. As of October 2010, these awards were fully vested. Total cash paid to settle the liabilities during 2011 and 2010 was not material.
The excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and vested restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing activities were $8 in 2012 , and $11 in 2011 and 2010 .  Cash received from the exercise of stock options was $112 , $96 , and $139 for 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively, and are reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Commitments and Contingencies The company is a party to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business.
Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal proceedings and claims and has recognized liabilities for such contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in managements opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the company.
The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily related to warehouse and office facilities, retail store space and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease commitments was $48 in 2012 , $50 in 2011 , and $48 in 2010 . Future minimum annual rental payments under these operating leases as of July29, 2012 are as follows: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter $42 $31 $24 $22 $20 $60 The company guarantees approximately 2,000 bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $164 . The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized as of July29, 2012 , and July31, 2011 ,were not material.
The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions. Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates. Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such matters were not material at July29, 2012 .

19. Subsequent Events On August6, 2012 , the company completed the acquisition of BF Bolthouse Holdco LLC (Bolthouse Farms) from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for $1,550 in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments related to the amount of Bolthouse Farms' cash, debt, working capital, transaction expenses and taxes. Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added natural, healthy products. Bolthouse Farms has leading market positions in retail fresh carrots and super-premium beverages in the U.S. and Canada. The acquisition was funded through a combination of short- and long-term borrowings. Approximately $300 was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. The terms of long-term borrowings, which were issued on August 2, 2012 to fund the transaction, were as follows:  $400 floating rate notes that mature on August1, 2014 . Interest on the notes is based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR . plus 0.30% Interest is payable quarterly beginning November 1, 2012;  $450 of 2.50% notes that mature on August2, 2022 . Interest is payable semi-annually beginning February 2, 2013. The company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption; and  $400 of 3.80% notes that mature on August2, 2042 . Interest is payable semi-annually beginning February 2, 2013. The company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption.
In 2012, the company recorded pre-tax transaction costs of $5 ( $3 after tax or $.01 per share) related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms. The company expects to incur an additional $11 in transaction costs in 2013. The company is currently working through the purchase price allocation process.
On September 27, 2012, the company announced several initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network. The company expects to eliminate approximately 727 positions in connection with the initiatives, which include the following:  The company will close its thermal plant in Sacramento, California, which produces soups, sauces and beverages. The closure will result in the elimination of approximately 700 full-time positions and will be completed in phases, with plans to cease operations in July 2013. The company plans to shift the majority of Sacramento's soup, sauce and beverage production to its thermal plants in Maxton, North Carolina; Napoleon, Ohio; and Paris, Texas.
The company will also close its spice plant in South Plainfield, New Jersey, which will result in the elimination of 27 positions. The company will consolidate spice production at its Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plant in 2013.
63 As a result of these initiatives, the company expects to incur aggregate pre-tax costs of approximately $115 , consisting of the following:  approximately $25 in employee severance and benefits;  approximately $75 in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment; and  approximately $15 in other costs.
The company expects to incur the majority of these costs in 2013. Approximately $38 of the pre-tax costs are expected to be cash expenditures. In addition, the company expects to invest approximately $27 in capital expenditures, primarily to relocate and refurbish a beverage filling and packaging line.

The financial information appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent with the financial statements. Management is responsible for the information and representations in such financial statements, including the estimates and judgments required for their preparation. The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the company, meets regularly with the companys worldwide internal auditing department, other management personnel, and the independent registered public accounting firm.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of July29, 2012.In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July29, 2012.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July29, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
