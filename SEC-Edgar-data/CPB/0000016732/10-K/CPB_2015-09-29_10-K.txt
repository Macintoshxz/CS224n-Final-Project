Business The Company Campbell Soup Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (Campbell or the company), is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back to 1869. The companys principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.
Background On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of BF Bolthouse Holdco LLC (Bolthouse Farms). Based in Bakersfield, California, Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added products. After taking into account customary purchase price adjustments, the final all-cash purchase price was $1.561 billion . For more information on the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On June 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Plum, PBC (Plum). Based in Emeryville, California, Plum is a leading provider of premium, organic foods and snacks that serve the nutritional needs of babies, toddlers and children. The final all-cash purchase price was $249 million. For more information on the Plum acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On August 8, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Kelsen Group A/S (Kelsen). Based in Nrre Snede, Denmark, Kelsen is a producer of quality baked snacks that are sold in 85 countries around the world. The final all-cash purchase price was $331 million. For more information on the Kelsen acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its European simple meals business to Soppa Investments S. r.l., an affiliate of CVC Capital Partners. The all-cash preliminary sale price was 400 million , or $548 million , and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. The company recognized a pre-tax gain of $141 million ( $72 million after tax or $.23 per share) in 2014. The company has reflected the results of the European simple meals business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. For more information on the sale of the European simple meals business, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reportable Segments The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and Bolthouse and Foodservice. The company has 10 operating segments based on product type and geographic location and has aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics; products; production processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory environment. See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail below.
U.S. Simple Meals The U.S.Simple Meals segment includes the following products: Campbells condensed and ready-to-serve soups; Swanson broth and stocks; Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbells gravies, pasta, beans and dinner sauces; Swanson canned poultry; and as of June 13, 2013, Plum Organics food and snacks.
Global Baking and Snacking The Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments: Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S.retail; Arnotts biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific; and as of August 8, 2013, Kelsen cookies globally.
International Simple Meals and Beverages The International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates the following operating segments: the retail business in Canada and the simple meals and beverages business in Asia Pacific, Latin America and China. See Background and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of the European simple meals business, which was historically included in this segment. The results of operations of the European simple meals business have been reflected as discontinued operations for the years presented.
3 U.S. Beverages The U.S.Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail beverages business, including the following products: V8 juices and beverages, and Campbells tomato juice.
Bolthouse and Foodservice Bolthouse and Foodservice comprises the Bolthouse Farms carrot products operating segment, including fresh carrots, juice concentrate and fiber; the Bolthouse Farms super-premium refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings operating segment; and the North America Foodservice operating segment. The North America Foodservice operating segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entres, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada. None of these operating segments meets the criteria for aggregation nor the thresholds for separate disclosure.
Ingredients and Packaging The ingredient and packaging materials required for the manufacture of the companys food products are purchased from various suppliers. These items are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, energy costs, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements and regional drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price volatility, the company uses a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts, inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of its ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At this time, the company does not anticipate any material restrictions on availability or shortages of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on the companys businesses. For information on the impact of inflation on the company, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Customers In most of the companys markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through the companys own sales force and its third-party broker and distributor partners. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America, the companys products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the companys products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. The company makes shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders.
The company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 35% of the company's consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2014, 36% in 2013 and 37% in 2012. The companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 19% of the companys consolidated net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012. All of the companys reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the companys consolidated net sales.
Trademarks and Technology As of September 15 , 2014, the company owned over 3,700 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries. The company believes its trademarks are of material importance to its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The company believes that its principal brands, including Arnott's, Bolthouse Farms, Campbell's, Goldfish, Kjeldsens, Pace, Pepperidge Farm, Plum Organics, Prego, Swanson and V8, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. In addition, some of the company's products are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties.
Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Competition The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal products. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of generic and private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service.
4 Working Capital For information relating to the companys cash and working capital items, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Capital Expenditures During 2014, the companys aggregate capital expenditures were $347 million . The company expects to spend approximately $400 million for capital projects in 2015. Major 2015 capital projects include a Bolthouse Farms beverage and salad dressing capacity expansion project, the ongoing implementation of a series of related initiatives to simplify and standardize the soup-making process in North America (also known as the soup common platform initiative), the ongoing Pepperidge Farm cracker capacity expansion project, the ongoing enhancement of the company's corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, an ongoing Bolthouse Farms warehouse capacity expansion project and an Indonesian biscuit capacity expansion project.
Research and Development During the last three fiscal years, the companys expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were $121 million in 2014, $128 million in 2013, and $116 million in 2012. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and cost savings from restructuring initiatives, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. The increase from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and benefit costs, the addition of Bolthouse Farms expenses and higher costs associated with product innovation in North America.
Environmental Matters The company has requirements for the operation and design of its facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of the companys $347 million in capital expenditures made during 2014, approximately $15 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. The company further estimates that approximately $16 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2015 will be for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations. The company believes that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company. In addition, the company continues to monitor pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere, including proposed regulations in the U.S. to limit carbon dioxide emissions from electric utilities, as well as other laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these pending laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, the company does not believe that compliance with these pending laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.
Seasonality Demand for the companys products is somewhat seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the companys soup products. Sales of Kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving. Demand for the companys other simple meal and baking and snacking products, as well as the company's beverage products, is generally evenly distributed throughout the year.
Employees On August3, 2014 , there were approximately 19,400 employees of the company.
Financial Information Financial information for the companys reportable segments and geographic areas is found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks attendant to the companys foreign operations, see Risk Factors.
Company Website The companys primary corporate website can be found at www.campbellsoupcompany.com . The company makes available free of charge at this website (under the Investor Center  Financial Information  SEC Filings caption) all of its reports (including amendments) filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its current reports on Form 8-K. These reports are made available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with, or furnishing to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair the companys business operations and financial condition.
5 The company operates in a highly competitive industry The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and experiences international competition in all of its principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of the company's primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to the company's marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.
The company's results are dependent on strengthening its established businesses while diversifying into higher-growth spaces The company's strategy is focused on strengthening its established businesses while diversifying its portfolio into higher-growth spaces. Its established simple meals, snacks and healthy beverages businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. Factors that may impact the company's success in strengthening these businesses and/or diversifying its portfolio into higher-growth spaces include:  the company's ability to identify and capitalize on higher-growth spaces;  the company's ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to new or improved products or packaging;  the company's ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans;  the company's ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs;  the company's ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and  changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which the company competes.
If the company is not successful in addressing theses factors, the company's strategy may not be successful and/or the company's business or financial results may be negatively impacted.
The company's results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully The company's ability to meet its objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on its ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include:  the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into the company's existing operations;  diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;  potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses;  potential assumption of unknown liabilities;  the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment;  potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and  the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience.
Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase the company's exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. The company's business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.
Disruption to the company's supply chain could adversely affect its business The company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products may be impaired by damage or disruption to its manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond the company's control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in the company's business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop disease and/or  crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect the company's business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect the company's ability to manufacture and/or sell its products, as well as its business or financial results.
6 The company's non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to the company's business In 2014, approximately 22% of the company's consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. The company's business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:  unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;  the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;  the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;  political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts;  the possible nationalization of operations;  the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and  restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially negative tax consequences.
In addition, the company holds assets and incurs liabilities, generates revenue, and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The company's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.dollars, and the company must translate its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S.dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S.dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the company's consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.
The company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions Customer and consumer demand for the company's products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact the company's ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company.
Increased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect the company's business or financial results The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of the company's food products, as well as the health and safety of the company's employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., the company is subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.  In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to the company's marketing could damage the company's reputation and/or could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
The company's results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials The raw and packaging materials used in the company's business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, import and export requirements and changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs.  To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, the company may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through its commodity hedging activity.
7 Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect the company's business or operations The company's business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:  unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;  disrupt the company's ability, or the ability of its suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute the company's products;  disrupt the retail operations of the company's customers; or  unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, the company's products.
In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace The company intends to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of its products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, the company's business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
The company may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of its customers The company's businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If the company is not successful in pursuing its strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, its business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If the company is unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted.
In 2014, the company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 35% of the company's consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 19% of the company's consolidated net sales. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of the company's other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect the company's business or financial results.
If the company's food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items, and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured The company may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the company's reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of its products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim.
8 The company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, its information technology systems The company's information technology systems are critically important to the company's operations. The company relies on  its information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of its functions, including its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, the company's business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If the company is unable to prevent material failures, the company's operations may be impacted, and the company may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations.
The company's results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of its brands The company has a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of the company's business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company's ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that the company has acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about the company's products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), the company's failure to maintain the quality of its products, the failure of the company's products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about the company, its brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage the company's brands and reputation.  If the company does not maintain the favorable perception of its brands, the company's results could be negatively impacted.
The company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology or other initiatives The company's success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in the company's highly competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an interruption to the company's sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service or accounting functions.
The company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to its defined benefit pension plans The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of the company's defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the company's obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company.

Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Description of the Company Campbell Soup Company is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and Bolthouse and Foodservice.
On August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm. After taking into account customary purchase price adjustments, the final all-cash purchase price was $1.561 billion . See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.
On June 13, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Plum. The final all-cash purchase price was $249 million . See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.
On August 8, 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Kelsen. The final all-cash purchase price was $331 million . See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.
On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its European simple meals business to Soppa Investments S. r.l., an affiliate of CVC Capital Partners. The all-cash preliminary sale price was 400 million , or $548 million , and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. The company has reflected the results of the European simple meals business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Key Strategies Campbell's long-term goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. In its efforts to achieve this goal, the company is guided by its purpose - "Real Food That Matters For Life's Moments" - which it articulated in 2014 as an expression of its core beliefs and the foundation of its historic connection with consumers. With this purpose as its compass, the company is pursuing a strategy that is focused on strengthening its established simple meals, snacks and healthy beverages businesses while diversifying its portfolio into higher-growth spaces.
Campbell plans to take a number of steps in 2015 to strengthen its established businesses. In its North American soup and simple meals business, the company expects to improve performance by enhancing product quality and elevating its marketing and brand-building efforts. The company will also introduce new soup and simple meal products responsive to consumers desire for indulgent or premium foods; their increasing appetite for ethnic and regional cuisines; and their growing interest in quick and easy home-cooking solutions. For its shelf-stable beverage business, the company will target health-conscious adults with its V8 branded beverages and households with children with its V8 Splash branded beverages. Pepperidge Farm will remain focused on building the Goldfish cracker brand, maintaining the momentum of its fresh bakery portfolio, and revitalizing its adult savory crackers business. The company will also continue its efforts to reinvigorate its businesses in Australia, focusing on Arnott's biscuits.
Since 2013, Campbell has acquired three businesses - Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen - and divested its European simple meals business as part of its effort to diversify its portfolio into higher-growth spaces. This effort will continue in 2015, with a focus on four key growth platforms:  Accelerating breakthrough innovation, including through continued expansion of the company's dinner sauces platform and the introduction of V8 Protein shakes and bars.
Becoming a branded leader in packaged fresh foods. For example, in 2015 Bolthouse Farms will introduce its first kid-focused line of refrigerated snacks and beverages, building on its existing businesses in fresh carrots, super-premium beverages and salad dressings.
Expanding in developing markets in Asia and Latin America, where the company already has footholds in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico.
14  Increasing the availability of the company's products. Across its portfolio, Campbell plans to increase the availability of many of its products by focusing on higher growth alternative retail grocery channels, such as the convenience, club and e-commerce channels.
Executive Summary This Executive Summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
There were 53 weeks in 2014. There were 52 weeks in 2013 and 2012.
Net sales increased 3% in 2014 to $8.268 billion . The Kelsen and Plum acquisitions contributed 3 points of growth and the 53 rd week contributed 2 points of growth.
Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 35.1% from 36.2% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to cost inflation and increased supply chain costs, higher promotional spending and the impact of acquisitions, partly offset by productivity improvements and a reduction in restructuring-related costs.
Administrative expenses decreased 15% to $573 million from $677 million a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost savings from restructuring initiatives and lower pension expenses, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.
Earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.33 in 2014, compared to $2.17 a year ago. The current and prior  year included expenses of $.20 and $.31 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below.
Earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2014 Compared with 2013 The following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:  In 2014, the company recognized pre-tax pension settlement charges in Cost of products sold of $22 million ( $14 million after tax or $.04 per share) associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California;  On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its simple meals business in Europe. In 2014, the company recorded a loss of $9 million ($6 million after tax or $.02 per share) on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of the European simple meals business. The loss was included in Other expenses. In addition, the company recorded tax expense of $7 million ($.02 per share) associated with the sale of the business;  In 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $ 54 million ( $33 million after tax or $.10 per share) associated with initiatives to streamline its salaried workforce in North America and its workforce in the Asia Pacific region; restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for its soup and broth business in China; improve supply chain efficiency in Australia; and reduce overhead across the organization. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges" for additional information;  In 2013, the company implemented several initiatives to improve its U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across its U.S. thermal plant network; expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico; improve its Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure; and reduce overhead in North America. In 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1 million and restructuring-related costs of $3 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $3 million after tax or $.01 per share) related to the 2013 initiatives. In 2013, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $51 million and restructuring-related costs of $91 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $90 million after tax or $.28 per share) related to the 2013 initiatives. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges" for additional information; and  In 2013, the company incurred pre-tax transaction costs of $10 million ( $7 million after tax or $.02 per share) associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which closed on August 6, 2012. The costs were included in Other expenses.

Earnings from continuing operations were $737 million ( $2.33 per share) in 2014, compared to $689 million ( $2.17 per share) in 2013. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings increased primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the benefit of the additional week and lower marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage, lower sales (excluding the impact of acquisitions and the 53 rd week), and a higher effective tax rate. The additional week contributed approximately $.08 per share to earnings from continuing operations in 2014.
The company sold its European simple meals business on October 28, 2013. See "Discontinued Operations" for additional information.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information; and  In 2012, the company recorded restructuring charges of $3 million ($2 million after tax or $.01 per share) associated with reducing overhead.

After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings increased in 2013 from 2012. The increase was primarily due to sales growth, lower marketing expenses, the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher administrative expenses and higher selling expenses. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, reflecting the impact of the companys strategic share repurchase program in 2012.

In 2014, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 3% . U.S. soup sales decreased 1%. Excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week, U.S. soup sales decreased 2%. Further details of U.S. soup, excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week, include:  Sales of Campbells condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in eating varieties partially offset by gains in cooking varieties. Lower volumes and increased promotional spending were partly offset by higher selling prices.
Sales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 6%, primarily due to declines in canned and microwavable soup varieties.
Broth sales increased 8%, primarily due to more effective marketing programs, innovation and distribution gains.
Sales of other simple meals increased 15%, primarily due to the acquisition of Plum in June 2013, which contributed 9 points of growth. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and the benefit of the 53 rd week, sales increased due to gains in Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of Alfredo sauces; and Campbell's dinner sauces, which benefited from the introduction in 2014 of Campbell's Slow Cooker Sauces; partially offset by declines in Campbell's canned gravy products.
In 2013, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 5% , reflecting increases in U.S. soup and and other simple meals. U.S. soup sales increased 5%, benefiting from improved execution and the favorable impact of weather. Further details of U.S. soup include:  Sales of Campbells condensed soups increased 2%, with gains in both cooking and eating varieties.
Sales of ready-to-serve soups increased 9%, due to volume-driven gains in Campbell's Chunky canned soups, which benefited from new varieties, increased promotional spending and a return to NFL-themed advertising.
Broth sales increased 4%, primarily driven by double-digit gains in aseptically packaged broth, partially offset by lower sales of canned products and lower sales of Swanson Flavor Boost concentrated broth, which was introduced in 2012.
Sales of other simple meals increased 5% primarily due to the acquisition of Plum in June 2013, growth in Prego pasta sauces, the 2013 launch of Campbell's Skillet Sauces, and growth in Pace Mexican sauces, partially offset by lower sales in other simple meals products.
In 2014, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 7% . The acquisition of Kelsen contributed $193 million to sales, or 8 points of growth. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and the benefit of the 53 rd week, sales decreased primarily due to the 18 impact of currency. Excluding the  benefit of the 53 rd week, Pepperidge Farm sales increased slightly with growth in fresh bakery and Goldfish crackers, partially offset by declines in adult cracker varieties and frozen products. In fresh bakery, sales increased due to gains in sandwich bread and rolls. In Arnott's, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency and sales declines in Australia in savory and chocolate varieties, partially offset by strong gains in Indonesia and the benefit of the 53 rd week. The company increased trade spending in Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm to remain competitive.
In 2013, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 4% with gains in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily due to growth in fresh bakery products, Goldfish crackers and cookies. Sales of fresh bakery products benefited from improved marketplace performance and increased shelf space at retail outlets resulting from the bankruptcy of a competitor.  Arnotts sales increased primarily due to gains in Indonesia, partially offset by the impact of currency.  Promotional spending was increased by Pepperidge Farm for competitive reasons and to capitalize on the opportunity to increase shelf space in the U.S. bread category and in Arnott's to remain competitive in the Australian marketplace.
In 2014, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 10% . In Canada, sales decreased due to the impact of currency and declines in beverages, partly offset by gains in snacks. In Latin America, sales declined due to the impact of presenting revenue on a net basis and lower selling prices in Mexico. In the Asia Pacific region, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency and declines in Australia, primarily in soup, partially offset by gains in Malaysia.
In 2013, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales were comparable to 2012. Sales declines in the Asia Pacific region, primarily due to currency and declines in exports, were partially offset by gains in China, Canada and Latin America. Promotional spending was increased , primarily to support the soup business in Canada, in response to more intense price competition in the marketplace.
In 2014, U.S. Beverages sales decreased 3% , primarily from declines in V8 V-Fusion multi-serve beverages and softness in single-serve beverages, due in part to the transition in 2014 to a new distribution network for the immediate consumption channel. U.S. Beverages continues to be under pressure from category weakness in shelf-stable juices, as well as from competition from specialty beverages and packaged fresh juices.
In 2013, U.S. Beverages sales decreased 4% due to declines in sales of V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion beverages, partially offset by an increase in V8 Splash beverages. Promotional spending was increased, primarily on V8 Splash beverages, in response to more price-based competition in the value segment.
In 2014, Bolthouse and Foodservice sales increased 5% . The increase was due in part to the benefit of the 53 rd week and the additional week of Bolthouse sales in 2014 as the business was acquired one week into 2013. Excluding the additional week of Bolthouse in 2014 and the benefit of the 53 rd week, segment sales increased as gains in Bolthouse beverages and salad dressings were partially offset by declines in North America Foodservice. The North America Foodservice decline was due to volume declines in fresh soup sold at retail perimeter and the impact of currency.
In 2013, Bolthouse and Foodservice sales increased due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms in 2013, which contributed $756 million to sales. North America Foodservice sales declined 8% primarily due to declines in frozen soup products, reflecting the loss of a major restaurant customer, and higher levels of trade spending to remain competitive.

Earnings from Bolthouse and Foodservice increased 1% in 2014 versus 2013. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the increase in sales and the benefit of the 53 rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased marketing investment for Bolthouse Farms.
Earnings from Bolthouse and Foodservice increased $31 million in 2013 from 2012 due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which contributed $63 million, partially offset by lower earnings in North America Foodservice resulting from the decline in sales.
Unallocated corporate expenses in 2014 included pension settlement charges of $22 million associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlement resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California. The current year also included a $9 million loss on foreign exchange forward contracts related to the sale of the European simple meals business and $3 million of restructuring-related costs. Unallocated corporate expenses in 2013 included $91 million of restructuring-related costs and $10 million of transaction costs associated with the Bolthouse Farms acquisition.

The prior year included a tax benefit of $55 million on $152 million of restructuring charges and related costs and acquisition transaction costs. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the remaining increase in the effective rate in 2014 was primarily due to the prior-year rate benefiting from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of state tax matters.
The decline in the effective tax rate in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to lower state taxes, including the favorable resolution of certain matters, and an increase in the U.S. manufacturing deduction.

26 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 2,000 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third-party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees the company could be required to make is $179 million . The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.
INFLATION In 2014, inflation in cost of products sold was higher than 2013. In 2013, inflation in cost of products sold was lower than 2012. The company continues to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.
MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for 22% of 2014 net sales from continuing operations, are concentrated principally in Australia and Canada. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. Cross-currency swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.
The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, wheat, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa and corn, which impact the cost of raw materials.
The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August3, 2014 . Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13 through 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt  represent the weighted-average rates at August3, 2014 . Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the weighted-average forward rates for the term of each contract.

The aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $383 million as of July28, 2013 , and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $24 million as of July28, 2013 .
The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted-average contract exchange rates as of August3, 2014 .

The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $1 million as of August3, 2014 . The total forward exchange contracts outstanding were $641 million, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $2 million as of July28, 2013 .
28 The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. The notional value of these contracts was $146 million , and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of August3, 2014 . The notional value of these contracts was $105 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $4 million as of July28, 2013 .
The company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the companys capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the total return on company capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on company capital stock was $25 million at August3, 2014 and $26 million at July28, 2013 . The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2015 , was 0.61% at August3, 2014 . The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was $22 million at August3, 2014 and $19 million at July28, 2013 . The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2015 , was 0.61% at August3, 2014 . The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $9 million at August3, 2014 and $5 million at July28, 2013 .

The fair value of these contracts was a $3 million loss at August3, 2014 and a $2 million gain at July28, 2013 .
The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on the companys overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
Valuation of long-lived assets Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
29 Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.
As of August3, 2014 , the carrying value of goodwill was $2,433 million . As of August3, 2014 , goodwill related to the acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 was as follows: Bolthouse Farms - $692 million , Plum - $128 million and Kelsen - $140 million . As of the 2014 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value, excluding the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, excluding the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, to be in excess of the fair value. Within the acquisitions, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of reporting units by at least 4% and as a result, holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would result in the carrying value to be in excess of the fair value. The fair value was based on significant management assumptions. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.
As of August3, 2014 , the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $957 million . As of August3, 2014 , trademarks related to the acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 were as follows: Bolthouse Farms - $383 million, Plum - $115 million and Kelsen - $147 million. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2014 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of  trademarks, and result in an impairment charge of approximately $25 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 million was recorded on goodwill and $36 million on trademarks for the simple meals business in Europe. The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. On August 12, 2013, the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of this business. The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The assets and liabilities have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 28, 2013.  On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its European simple meals business. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.
In 2012, as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized related to a trademark used in the European simple meals business, formerly included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.
The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the companys control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods.
The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method.  Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year.
Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $109 million in 2014, $130 million in 2013 and $102 million in 2012.
30 Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Pension Discount rate for benefit obligations 4.33% 4.82% 4.05% Expected return on plan assets 7.62% 7.62% 7.65% Postretirement Discount rate for obligations 4.00% 4.50% 3.75% Initial health care trend rate 8.25% 8.25% 8.25% Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $12 million; a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $12 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million.
Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to decrease to approximately $75 million in 2015. The reduction is primarily due to pension settlement charges of $22 million recognized in 2014 associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California.
The company contributed $35 million , $75 million and $55 million , respectively, to U.S. pension plans in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were $12 million in 2014 and 2013, and $16 million in 2012. The company does not expect to contribute to the U.S. pension plans in 2015. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $6 million in 2015.
See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses.
Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Campbell Soup Company, together with its subsidiaries (the company), is a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products.
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and entities in which the company maintains a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.The company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July31. There were 53 weeks in 2014, and 52 weeks in 2013 and 2012.
Use of Estimates Generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales promotion expenses, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupon redemption costs, are classified as a reduction of sales. The recognition of costs for promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Costs are recognized either upon sale or when the incentive is offered, based on the program. Revenues are presented on a net basis for arrangements under which suppliers perform certain additional services.
Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
Inventories All inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods not exceeding 45 yearsand 20 years, respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in business climate or a plan of disposal. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.
See Note 6 for information on intangible assets and an impairment charge recognized in 2013.
Derivative Financial Instruments The company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee benefit obligations. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company's derivative programs include strategies that qualify and strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated.
38 All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, on the date the derivative contract is entered into, the company designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. If the hedge is no longer effective, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in earnings each period until the instrument matures. If a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of designated hedges is recognized in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.
Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities.
Advertising Production Costs Advertising production costs are expensed in the period that the advertisement first takes place or when a decision is made not to use an advertisement.
Research and Development Costs The costs of research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and improvements to existing products and processes. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting, and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
2.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to disclosures about offsetting (netting) of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions that are offset in the statement of financial position, and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The scope includes financial instruments and derivative instruments. In January 2013, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance to limit the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosures to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending transactions to the extent that they are offset in the financial statements or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar arrangement. The disclosures were required for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2014. The adoption resulted in additional disclosures, but did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 14.
In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The company adopted the guidance in 2014. The adoption did not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount is fixed. Such obligations may include debt arrangements, legal settlements, and other contractual arrangements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for those obligations within scope that existed as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The company will apply the guidance to applicable transactions.
39 In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance which permits an entity to designate the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate, also referred to as the overnight index swap rate, as a benchmark interest rate in a hedge accounting relationship. In addition, the guidance removes the restriction on using different benchmark interest rates for similar hedges. The guidance was effective in July 2013. The company will apply the guidance to applicable transactions.
In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions.  Under the new standard, UTBs will be netted against all available same-jurisdiction loss or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized, rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the UTBs. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied prospectively to all UTBs that exist at the effective date. Retrospective application is permitted. The company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
In April 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance redefining discontinued operations, which changes the criteria  for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted.  The company will prospectively apply the guidance to applicable transactions.
In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating the new guidance.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill The following table shows the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment: U.S.
Simple Meals Global Baking and Snacking International SimpleMeals and Beverages U.S.
Beverages Bolthouse and Foodservice Total Balance at July 29, 2012 $ 322 $ 872 $ 561 $ 112 $ 146 $ 2,013 Acquisitions 128    692 820 Impairment   (360 )   (360 ) Reclassification to assets held for sale   (110 )   (110 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment  (97 ) 31   (66 ) Balance at July 28, 2013 $ 450 $ 775 $ 122 $ 112 $ 838 $ 2,297 Acquisition  140    140 Foreign currency translation adjustment  3 (7 )   (4 ) Balance at August 3, 2014 $ 450 $ 918 $ 115 $ 112 $ 838 $ 2,433 In 2014, the company acquired Kelsen for $331 and goodwill related to the acquisition was $140 . See Note 3.
In 2013, the company acquired Bolthouse Farms for $1,561 and Plum for $249 . Goodwill related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and Plum was $692 and $128 , respectively. See Note 3.
On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its European simple meals business.The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July28, 2013. The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 was recorded on goodwill for the simple meals business in Europe to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value of $110 . The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. The impairment charge was recorded in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
44 Intangible Assets The following table sets forth balance sheet information for intangible assets, excluding goodwill, subject to amortization and intangible assets not subject to amortization: Intangible Assets 2014 2013 Amortizable intangible assets Customer relationships $ 178 $ 156 Technology 40 40 Other 35 32 Total gross amortizable intangible assets $ 253 $ 228 Accumulated amortization (35 ) (17 ) Total net amortizable intangible assets $ 218 $ 211 Non-amortizable intangible assets Trademarks 957 810 Total net intangible assets $ 1,175 $ 1,021 Non-amortizable intangible assets consist of trademarks, which include Bolthouse Farms, Pace , Plum Organics, Kjeldsens and Royal Dansk . Trademarks of $150 used in the European simple meals business have been included in assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July28, 2013 . Other amortizable intangible assets consist of recipes, patents, trademarks and distributor relationships.
Amortization of intangible assets of continuing operations was $18 for 2014, $14 for 2013 and $1 for 2012. Amortization expense for the following 5 years is estimated to be $18 in each of the fiscal periods 2015 through 2017, and $14 in 2018 and 2019. Asset useful lives range from 5 to 20 years.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $36 was recognized related to certain trademarks of the European business held for sale, including Royco, Isomitta and Heisse Tasse . The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows as previously discussed. In 2012, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 was recognized related to trademarks of the European simple meals business. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows. The impairment charges were recorded in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
The discounted estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the companys control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.

Bolthouse and Foodservice comprises the Bolthouse Farms carrot products operating segment, including fresh carrots, juice concentrate and fiber; the Bolthouse Farms super-premium refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings operating segment; and the North America Foodservice operating segment. The North America Foodservice operating segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entres, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada. None of these operating segments meets the criteria for aggregation nor the thresholds for separate disclosure. Bolthouse Farms was acquired on August 6, 2012.
The company evaluates segment performance before interest, taxes and costs associated with restructuring activities. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment operating earnings and are recorded in Corporate expenses as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases. Upon closing of the contracts, the realized gain or loss is transferred to segment operating earnings, which allows the segments to reflect the economic effects of the hedge without exposure to quarterly volatility of unrealized gains and losses. Certain manufacturing, warehousing and distribution activities of the segments are integrated in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, asset information by segment is not discretely maintained for internal reporting or used in evaluating performance. Therefore, only geographic segment asset information is included in the disclosure.
The company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012. All of the company's reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Earningsper Share The accounting guidance for earnings per share provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and 51 participation rights in undistributed earnings. Awards issued by the company prior to 2011 contained non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.
The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders is as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company $ 737 $ 689 $ 734 Less: Allocation to participating securities   (4 ) Available to Campbell Soup Company common shareholders $ 737 $ 689 $ 730 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations $ 81 $ (231 ) $ 40 Less: Allocation to participating securities   (1 ) Available to Campbell Soup Company common shareholders $ 81 $ (231 ) $ 39 Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company $ 818 $ 458 $ 774 Less: Allocation to participating securities   (5 ) Available to Campbell Soup Company common shareholders $ 818 $ 458 $ 769 Weighted average shares outstanding  basic 314 314 317 Effect of dilutive securities: stock options and other share based payment awards 2 3 2 Weighted average shares outstanding  diluted 316 317 319 Earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company per common share: Basic $ 2.35 $ 2.19 $ 2.30 Diluted $ 2.33 $ 2.17 $ 2.29 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations per common share: Basic $ .26 $ (.74 ) $ .12 Diluted $ .26 $ (.73 ) $ .12 Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company per common share (1) : Basic $ 2.61 $ 1.46 $ 2.43 Diluted $ 2.59 $ 1.44 $ 2.41 ___________________________________ (1) The sum of the individual per share amounts may not add due to rounding.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension Benefits The company sponsors a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. In 1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continues to accrue through the year 2014 for active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the company from general funds. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the companys U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans.
Postretirement Benefits The company provides postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their dependents. The company established retiree medical account benefits for eligible U.S. retirees. The accounts were intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the retirement medical program was amended to eliminate the retiree medical account benefit for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. To preserve the benefit for employees close to retirement age, the retiree medical account will be available to employees who were at least age 50 with at least 10 years of service as of December 31, 2010, and who satisfy the other eligibility requirements for the retiree medical program.
The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for the benefit plans.
Components of benefit expense were as follows: Pension 2014 2013 2012 Service cost $ 42 $ 57 $ 55 Interest cost 115 108 122 Expected return on plan assets (176 ) (177 ) (178 ) Amortization of prior service credit (1 ) (1 )  Recognized net actuarial loss 76 108 74 Curtailment loss  3  Settlement charges 22   Net periodic benefit expense $ 78 $ 98 $ 73 The settlement charges of $22 in 2014 were associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan's assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California. The curtailment loss of $3 in 2013 related to the closure of the plant in Mexico and was included in the Restructuring charges. See also Note 8. In 2013 and 2012, net periodic benefit expense of $1 related to the simple meals business in Europe and was included in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations.

The amount reclassified in 2014 included the settlement charges and $2 of net actuarial losses recognized in discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the European simple meals business. The remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with pension benefits were primarily due to net actuarial losses arising during the period in 2014 and net actuarial gains arising during the period in 2013, as well as the impact of currency in both periods.
54 The change in other comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits was due to the reclassification of actuarial losses into earnings of $13 and $15 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with postretirement benefits were primarily due to net actuarial losses arising during the period in 2014 and net actuarial gains arising during the period in 2013.
The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss included $2 in 2013 related to the simple meals business in Europe.
The following table provides information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: 2014 2013 Projected benefit obligation $ 269 $ 1,817 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 257 $ 1,791 Fair value of plan assets $ 92 $ 1,625 The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $2,477 at August 3, 2014 and $2,423 at July28, 2013.
Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at the end of the year: Pension Postretirement 2014 2013 2014 2013 Discount rate 4.33% 4.82% 4.00% 4.50% Rate of compensation increase 3.30% 3.30% 3.25% 3.25% Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended: Pension 2014 2013 2012 Discount rate 4.82% 4.05% 5.41% Expected return on plan assets 7.62% 7.65% 7.90% Rate of compensation increase 3.30% 3.31% 3.31% The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management.
The discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was 4.50% in 2014, 3.75% in 2013 and 5.00% in 2012.
Assumed health care cost trend rates at the end of the year: 2014 2013 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 8.25% 8.25% Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) 4.50% 4.50% Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2022 2021 A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care costs would have the following effects on 2014 reported amounts: Increase Decrease Effect on service and interest cost $ 1 $ (1 ) Effect on the 2014 accumulated benefit obligation $ 16 $ (18 ) Pension Plan Assets The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations.
55 The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to plan obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations.
The portfolio includes investments in the following asset classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives. Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the plans obligations. Equities are used for their high expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide diversification.
Asset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight.
The companys year-end pension plan weighted-average asset allocations by category were: Strategic Target 2014 2013 Equity securities 51% 51% 54% Debt securities 35% 33% 32% Real estate and other 14% 16% 14% Net periodic benefit expense 100% 100% 100% Pension plan assets are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy:  Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted)for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on the company's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
56 The following table presents the companys pension plan assets by asset category at August 3, 2014 and July 28, 2013: Fair Value as of August 3, 2014 FairValueMeasurementsat August 3, 2014 Using Fair Value Hierarchy FairValue as of July28, 2013 FairValueMeasurementsat July28, 2013 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level1 Level 2 Level 3 Short-term investments $ 60 $ 23 $ 37 $  $ 78 $ 36 $ 42 $  Equities: U.S.

Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as Level 1 at cost which approximates market value. Other investment vehicles are valued based upon a net asset value and are classified as Level 2.
Equities Common stocks and preferred stocks are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
Corporate bonds These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates.
Government and agency bonds These investments are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade data for identical or similar obligations.
Municipal bonds These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates.
Commingled funds Investments in commingled funds are classified as Level 2 as the funds are not traded in active markets. Commingled funds are valued based on the unit values of such funds. Unit values are based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the funds derived from inputs principally based on quoted market prices in an active market or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Blended commingled funds are invested in both equities and fixed income securities.
57 Mortgage and asset backed securities Fair value is based on prices obtained from third party pricing sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage backed securities are traded in the over-the-counter market.
Real estate Real estate investments consist of real estate investment trusts, property funds and limited partnerships. Real estate investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether liquidity is limited or there are few observable market participant transactions. Fair value is based on third party appraisals. Limited partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the general partners of the funds. The values of limited partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third parties, expected cash flows, and market-based information, including comparable transactions and performance multiples among other factors. The investments are classified as Level 3 since the valuation is determined using unobservable inputs.
Hedge funds Hedge fund investments include hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the fair value of underlying securities and are therefore classified as Level 2. Hedge fund investments that are subject to liquidity restrictions or that are based on unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3. Hedge fund investments may include long and short positions in equity and fixed income securities, derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities and other types of securities.
Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included net accrued interest and dividends receivable, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and other payables.
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 investments for the years ended August 3, 2014 and July28, 2013: Real Estate Hedge Funds Total Fair value at July 28, 2013 $ 18 $ 30 $ 48 Actual return on plan assets 2 2 4 Purchases 3 22 25 Sales (3 )  (3 ) Settlements    Transfers out of Level 3    Fair value at August 3, 2014 $ 20 $ 54 $ 74 Real Estate Hedge Funds Total Fair value at July 29, 2012 $ 35 $  $ 35 Actual return on plan assets 2  2 Purchases  30 30 Sales (3 )  (3 ) Settlements    Transfers out of Level 3 (16 )  (16 ) Fair value at July 28, 2013 $ 18 $ 30 $ 48 No contributions are expected to be made to U.S. pension plans in 2015. Contributions to non-U.S. pension plans are expected to be approximately $6 in 2015.
Estimated future benefit payments are as follows: Pension Postretirement 2015 $ 151 $ 29 2016 $ 152 $ 30 2017 $ 153 $ 31 2018 $ 154 $ 31 2019 $ 160 $ 31 2020-2024 $ 838 $ 145 The estimated future benefit payments include payments from funded and unfunded plans.
58 Savings Plan The company sponsors employee savings plans which cover substantially all U.S. employees. Effective January 1, 2011, the company provides a matching contribution of 100% of employee contributions up to 4% of compensation for employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2011 who will not be eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements receive a contribution equal to 3% of compensation regardless of their participation in the Savings Plan. Prior to January 1, 2011, the company provided a matching contribution of 60% ( 50% at certain locations) of the employee contributions up to 5% of compensation after one year of continued service. Amounts charged to Costs and expenses were $29 in 2014, $27 in 2013 and $24 in 2012.
12.
Taxes on Earnings The provision for income taxes on earnings from continuing operations consists of the following: 2014 2013 2012 Income taxes: Currently payable: Federal $ 252 $ 268 $ 221 State 30 24 29 Non-U.S.
42 47 43 324 339 293 Deferred: Federal 32 (58 ) 31 State 2 (6 ) 2 Non-U.S.
(11 )  (1 ) 23 (64 ) 32 $ 347 $ 275 $ 325 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes: United States $ 995 $ 815 $ 918 Non-U.S.
78 140 131 $ 1,073 $ 955 $ 1,049 The following is a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate on continuing operations to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate: 2014 2013 2012 Federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes (net of federal tax benefit) 2.0 1.1 2.0 Tax effect of international items (1.0 ) (2.6 ) (3.8 ) Settlement of tax contingencies  (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Federal manufacturing deduction (2.3 ) (2.7 ) (1.9 ) Other (1.4 ) (1.9 ) (0.2 ) Effective income tax rate 32.3 % 28.8 % 31.0 % 59 Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: 2014 2013 Depreciation $ 300 $ 302 Amortization 541 484 Other 17 66 Deferred tax liabilities 858 852 Benefits and compensation 294 316 Pension benefits 63 61 Tax loss carryforwards 49 95 Capital loss carryforwards 112 104 Other 70 73 Gross deferred tax assets 588 649 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance (151 ) (148 ) Net deferred tax assets 437 501 Net deferred tax liability $ 421 $ 351 At August3, 2014 , U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $190 . Of these carryforwards, $145 expire between 2015 and 2033 , and $45 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax rates in these countries range from 15% to 35% . At August3, 2014 , deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established to offset $147 of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, at August3, 2014 , non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $418 , which were fully offset by valuation allowances.
The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2014 was an increase of $3 . The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards. The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2013 was an increase of $6 . The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards.
As of August3, 2014 , other deferred tax assets included $9 of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire between 2018 and 2024 . As of July28, 2013 , other deferred tax assets included $7 of foreign tax credit carryforwards that expire in 2023 , and $10 of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire between 2014 and 2022 . No valuation allowances have been established related to these deferred tax assets.
As of August3, 2014 , U.S. income taxes have not been provided on approximately $740 of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.
A reconciliation of the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits follows: 2014 2013 2012 Balance at beginning of year $ 61 $ 48 $ 43 Increases related to prior-year tax positions  28 2 Decreases related to prior-year tax positions (1 ) (7 ) (1 ) Increases related to current-year tax positions 11 9 9 Settlements  (15 )  Lapse of statute  (2 ) (5 ) Balance at end of year $ 71 $ 61 $ 48 The increase in 2013 for prior-year tax positions was primarily due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and Plum.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the annual effective tax rate was $23 as of August3, 2014 and July28, 2013 , and $18 as of July29, 2012 . The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change by approximately $27 within the next 12 months. It is likely that an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada will be settled that covers the years 2006 through 2013. The impact of the settlement is not expected to be material to the financial statements. As of August3, 2014 , $28 of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, were reported as accrued taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Approximately $2 of unrecognized tax benefits, including 60 interest and penalties, were reported as accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August3, 2014 , and July28, 2013 .
The companys accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was not material in 2014, 2013 and 2012. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $3 as of August3, 2014 , and $2 as of July28, 2013 .
The company does business internationally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the U.S., Australia, Canada and Denmark. The 2014 tax year is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, several state income tax examinations are in progress for the years 2006 to 2013.
With limited exceptions, the company has been audited for income tax purposes in Denmark through 2008, and in Canada and Australia through 2009.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings consist of the following: 2014 2013 Commercial paper $ 1,406 $ 1,162 Current portion of long-term debt 300 700 Variable-rate bank borrowings 47 44 Fixed-rate bank borrowings 17  Capital leases 1 2 Other (1)  1 $ 1,771 $ 1,909 _______________________________________ (1) Other includes unamortized net premium/discount on debt issuances and amounts related to interest rate swaps designated as fair-value hedges. For additional information on fair-value interest rate swaps, see Note14.
As of August 3, 2014, the weighted-average interest rate of commercial paper, which consisted of U.S. borrowings, was 0.27% . As of July28, 2013, the weighted-average interest rate of commercial paper, which consisted of U.S. borrowings, was 0.19% .
At August3, 2014 , the company had $1,771 of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $1,406 was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of August3, 2014 , $49 of standby letters of credit were issued on behalf of the company. In December 2013, the company renewed its committed revolving credit facilities, combining two previous facilities totaling $2,000 into a new five-year facility totaling $2,200 . The new facility matures in December 2018. This facility remained unused at August3, 2014 , except for $3 of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company.This revolving credit facility supports the companys commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. The company may also increase the commitment under the credit facility up to an additional $500 , upon the agreement of either existing lenders or of additional banks not currently parties to the existing credit agreements.
61 Long-term debt consists of the following: Type Fiscal Year of Maturity Rate 2014 2013 Notes 2014 4.88% $  $ 300 Notes 2014 LIBOR plus 0.30%  400 Notes 2015 3.38% 300 300 Notes 2017 3.05% 400 400 Notes 2019 4.50% 300 300 Notes 2021 4.25% 500 500 Debentures 2021 8.88% 200 200 Notes 2023 2.50% 450 450 Notes 2043 3.80% 400 400 Capital leases 3 4 Other (1) (9 ) (10 ) Total 2,544 3,244 Less current portion 300 700 Total long-term debt $ 2,244 $ 2,544 _______________________________________ (1) Other includes unamortized net premium/discount on debt issuances.

14.
Financial Instruments The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, the company follows established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, options, forwards and commodity futures. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The companys derivative programs include both instruments that qualify and that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Concentration of Credit Risk The company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected, leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, and distributes contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.The company does not have credit-risk-related contingent features in its derivative instruments as of August3, 2014 . During 2014, the company's largest customer accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales. The company closely monitors credit risk associated with counterparties and customers.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and U.S. dollar. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts, as well as cross-currency swaps, to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. The company hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to 18 months. To hedge currency exposures related to intercompany debt, foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts, as well as cross-currency swap contracts, are entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. As of August3, 2014 , cross-currency swap contracts mature between 11 and 35 months . The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $58 at August3, 2014 and $129 at July28, 2013 . The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on the same line item and the same period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross- 62 currency swap contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $561 and $895 at August3, 2014 and July28, 2013 , respectively.
Interest Rate Risk The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay variable rate interest rate swaps were accounted for as fair-value hedges. The notional amount of outstanding fair-value interest rate swaps totaled $200 at July28, 2013 . These swaps matured in October 2013. The company manages its exposure to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. Pay fixed rate/receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash-flow hedges. The notional amount of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps totaled $250 at August3, 2014 and at July28, 2013 . Forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $400 were settled in August 2012, at a loss of $2 , which was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The loss on the forward starting interest rate swaps will be amortized over the life of the 10-year debt issued in August 2012.
Commodity Price Risk The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, wheat, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa and corn, which impact the cost of raw materials. Commodity futures, options, and swap contracts are either accounted for as cash-flow hedges or are not designated as accounting hedges. The company hedges a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to 18 months. There were no commodity contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges as of August3, 2014 or July28, 2013 . The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was $146 at August3, 2014 and $105 at July28, 2013 .
Equity Price Risk The company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the companys capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the total return on company capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index.

Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy:  Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted)for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on the company's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, the company bases fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for credit and nonperformance risk.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents the companys financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of August3, 2014 , and July28, 2013 , consistent with the fair value hierarchy: Fair Value as of August 3, 2014 FairValueMeasurementsat August 3, 2014 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value as of July 28, 2013 FairValueMeasurementsat July 28, 2013 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets Interest rate swaps (1) $  $  $  $  $ 1 $  $ 1 $  Forward starting interest rate swaps (1) 11  11  23  23  Foreign exchange forward  contracts (2) 2  2  4  4  Commodity derivative contracts (3) 2 1 1  2 2   Deferred compensation derivative contracts (4)     2  2  Total assets at fair value $ 15 $ 1 $ 14 $  $ 32 $ 2 $ 30 $  66 Fair Value as of August 3, 2014 FairValueMeasurementsat August 3, 2014 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Fair Value as of July 28, 2013 FairValueMeasurementsat July 28, 2013 Using Fair Value Hierarchy Level1 Level2 Level3 Level1 Level2 Level3 Liabilities Foreign exchange forward  contracts (2) $ 3 $  $ 3 $  $ 6 $  $ 6 $  Cross-currency swap contracts (5) 6  6  24  24  Commodity derivative contracts (3) 11 11   6 5 1  Deferred compensation derivative contracts (4) 3  3      Deferred compensation obligation (6) 123 123   123 123   Total liabilities at fair value $ 146 $ 134 $ 12 $  $ 159 $ 128 $ 31 $  ___________________________________ (1) Based on LIBOR swap rates.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the company is also required to measure certain items at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
In the second quarter of 2014, the company recognized an impairment charge of $11 on plant assets associated with the initiative to restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for its soup and broth business in China. See also Note 8. The carrying value was reduced to estimated fair value based on expected proceeds. The carrying value was not material.
On October 28, 2013, the company completed the sale of its European simple meals business. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July28, 2013 .  The company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all years presented. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 was recorded on goodwill for the simple meals business in Europe to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value of $110 . The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management's assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses, which are unobservable Level 3 inputs, and taking into account the firm offer. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of the company's annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $36 was recognized on trademarks used in the European simple meals business. See also Note 6. Fair value was determined based on unobservable Level 3 inputs. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analysis that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates.

The carrying value of assets was reduced to estimated fair value based on expected proceeds. The carrying value was $29 at July28, 2013.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, approximate fair value.
Cash equivalents of $46 at August3, 2014 and $4 at July28, 2013 represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. Fair value of cash equivalents is based on Level 2 inputs.
The fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt in Short-term borrowings, was $2,647 at August3, 2014 and $3,299 at July28, 2013 . The carrying value was $2,544 at August3, 2014 and $3,244 at July28, 2013 . The fair value of long-term debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates.

Stock-based Compensation In 2003, shareholders approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 28 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. Approximately 3.2 million shares available under a previous long-term plan were rolled into the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, making the total number of available shares approximately 31.2 million . In November 2005, shareholders approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of awards.
Awards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively over a three -year period at a rate of 30% , 60% and 100% , respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant.
Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units and time-lapse restricted stock/units. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing the companys total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon the companys ranking in the performance peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 225% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units will be earned based upon the companys achievement of annual earnings per share 68 goals. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award of either 0% or 100% of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units are earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a two- or three-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, the company may issue special grants of time-lapse restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest ratably over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October. Annual stock option grants were not part of the long-term incentive compensation program for 2012 , 2013, or 2014. However, stock options may still be granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans.
In 2014, the company issued time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units, strategic performance restricted stock units and TSR performance restricted stock units.
Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in Earnings from continuing operations was $56 for 2014, $109 for 2013 and $76 for 2012. The pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations was $1 for 2014, $4 for 2013 and $3 for 2012. Tax-related benefits of $21 were recognized for 2014, $42 were recognized for 2013 and $29 were recognized for 2012.

Time-lapse restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. EPS performance restricted stock units are expensed on a graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an accelerated basis. There were 251 thousand EPS performance target grants outstanding at August3, 2014 with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $37.49 . Strategic performance restricted stock units are expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period. There were 887 thousand strategic performance target grants outstanding at August3, 2014 with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $37.80 .

As of August3, 2014 , total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock units was $15 , which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.8 years. In the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 , recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned 0% of the initial grants based upon the companys TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July26, 2013 and July 27, 2012, respectively. The grant-date fair value of the TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2013 was $39.76 . There were no TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2012.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of August3, 2014 .In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) . Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August3, 2014 .
76 The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of August3, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

OShea William J. OShea Vice President Controller (Principal Accounting Officer) September 24, 2014 77 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Directors of Campbell Soup Company In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Campbell Soup Company and its subsidiaries at August3, 2014 and July28, 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended August3, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August3, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
