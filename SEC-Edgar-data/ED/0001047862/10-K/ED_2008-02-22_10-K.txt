Con Edison Corporate Overview Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R). Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are referred to in this report as the Utilities. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. Con Edison has no significant business operations other than those of the Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. See Corporate Overview in Item7.
Operating Segments Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility segments, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility segments and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. For a discussion of operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see Results of Operations in Item7. For additional segment information see Note N to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edison of New York For information about Con Edison of New York, see below in this Item1.
O&R O&R, a subsidiary of Con Edison, has two wholly-owned utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO), a New Jersey corporation, and Pike County Light& Power Company (Pike), a Pennsylvania corporation.
O&R and its utility subsidiaries provide electric service in southeastern New York and in adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, an approximately 1,350 square mile service area. They also provide gas service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. O&Rs business is subject to regulation by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to O&R could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. O&Rs principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility businesses. In 2007, electric and gas operating revenues were 71 percent and 29 percent, respectively, of its operating revenues. See O&R Operating Statistics below.
Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edison pursues competitive energy opportunities through three wholly owned subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy) and Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions).
Con Edison Development owns, leases or operates energy and infrastructure projects, principally in the United States. Substantially all of its electric generation facilities are located in New England and the PJM Interconnection (PJM) markets. See Item2 for information about the companys generating capacity. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity 7 Table of Contents of approximately 1,706 megawatts. See Note U to the financial statements in Item8. Con Edison Development sells capacity and energy in wholesale markets administered by independent system operators in New England, New York and PJM. The company also sells capacity and energy to other utilities through its affiliate Con Edison Energy by participating in auctions for basic generation service or other wholesale supply transactions. These markets have developed significantly as states have opened their wholesale markets to competition.
Con Edison Development has investments in two Lease In/ Lease Out (LILO) transactionssee Note J to the financial statements in Item8. These leases involve gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands. Additionally, Con Edison Development has invested in tax-advantaged leases under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code. See Affordable Housing Program in Note H to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edison Energy markets the electric production of Con Edison Developments generation facilities and manages the fuel supply for those facilities. It also supplies electricity to wholesale customers, procures electricity for Con Edison Solutions, and offers plant optimization services to generation facilities in the northeastern United States.
Con Edison Solutions was reported by KEMA consulting in August 2007, as the ninth largest non-residential retail electricity provider in the United States. The company primarily sells electricity to industrial and large commercial customers and also to residential customers in the northeastern United States. At December31, 2007, it served approximately 48,300 customers, not including approximately 176,000 served under two aggregation agreements in Massachusetts. Con Edison Solutions sold 12.2million MWHs of electricity in 2007, a 15 percent increase over 2006 volumes.
Con Edison Solutions seeks to serve customers in utility service territories that encourage retail competition through transparent pricing, purchase of receivables or utility-sponsored customer acquisition programs. The company currently sells electricity in the service territories of 35 utilities in the states of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia.
Total peak load at the end of 2007 was 3,400 MWs. Most of the sales volumes were contracted by customers in New York, with essentially all of the remainder in New England and the Mid-Atlantic States. Con Edison Solutions entered the retail electricity supply market in Texas in 2006 and Illinois in 2007 but volumes remain small.
Con Edison Solutions offers the choice of green power to customers. In 2007 it sold approximately 130,000 MWHs of green power, ending the year with almost 13,000 customers. Green power is a term used by electricity suppliers to describe electricity produced from renewable energy sources, including wind, hydro and solar.
Con Edison Solutions also provides energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers. The services include the design and installation of lighting retrofits, high-efficiency heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment and other energy saving technologies. The company is compensated based primarily on the increased energy efficiency of installed equipment over a multi-year period. Con Edison Solutions has won competitive solicitations for energy savings contracts with the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and a shared energy savings contract with the United States Postal Service.

Regulation The Utilities are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including by state utility commissions and the FERC. Con Edison, itself, is not subject to such regulation except to the extent that the rules or orders of these agencies impose restrictions on relationships between Con Edison and the Utilities. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation has been granted authority by the FERC to set bulk system reliability standards and impose penalties upon utilities for violations of those standards. See Regulation in the discussion below of Con Edison of New Yorks business in this Item1.
8 Table of Contents Con Edison has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by legislative and regulatory developments. The Utilities are subject to extensive regulation in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to Con Edisons subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Companies. See Regulatory Matters in Item7.
Competition See Competition, below in the discussion of the businesses of Con Edison of New York in this Item1. The competitive energy businesses participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities.
Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edisons capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources and Capital Requirements and Financial and Commodity Market Risks in Item7.
State Anti-Takeover Law New York State law provides that a domestic corporation, such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporations board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent fair price formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.
Employees Con Edison has no employees other than those of Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses (which at December31, 2007 had 13,877, 1,051 and 286, employees, respectively). The collective bargaining agreements covering most of the employees of Con Edison of New York and O&R expire in June 2008 and June 2009, respectively.
Con Edison of New York Corporate Overview Con Edison of New York, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Con Edison of New York provides electric service in all of New York City (except part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million. It also provides gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens and Westchester, and steam service in parts of Manhattan.
Operating Segments Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses. In 2007, electric, gas and steam operating revenues were 75 percent, 18 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of its operating revenues. For a discussion of the companys operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see Results of Operations in Item7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item8.
Electric Operations Electric Sales.
Electric operating revenues were $7.4 billion in 2007 or 75 percent of Con Edison of New Yorks operating revenues. The percentages were 76 and 75 percent, respectively, in the two preceding years. In 2007, 43 percent of the electricity delivered by Con Edison of New York in its service area was sold by the company to its full-service customers, 37 percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions, a competitive energy business of Con Edison, to Con Edison of New Yorks customers under its electric retail access program and the balance was delivered to the state and municipal customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and the economic development customers of municipal electric agencies. The company charges its cost for the electricity it sells to full-service customers, and it charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity.
For additional information about electricity sales, see Con Edison of New York Operating Statistics, below, and Results of Operations in Item7.
Electric Peak Demand.
The electric peak demand in Con Edison of New Yorks service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The 2007 service area peak demand, which occurred on August8, 2007, was 12,807thousand kilowatts (MW). The 2007 peak demand included an estimated 6,004 MW for Con Edison of New Yorks full-service customers, 4,817 MW for customers participating in its electric retail access program and 1,986 MW for NYPAs customers and municipal electric agency customers. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) did not invoke demand reduction programs on August8, 2007, as it had on peak demand days in 2006 and 2005. Design weather for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the majority of demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs potential impact. However, the Con Edison of New York forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2008 service area peak demand will be 13,775 MW, including an estimated 6,430 MW for its full-service customers, 5,375 MW for its electric retail 9 Table of Contents access customers and 1,970 MW for NYPAs customers and municipal electric agency customers.
Electric Supply.
Most of the electricity sold by Con Edison of New York to its customers in 2007 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO.
The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers with electric energy purchased under contracts with non-utility generators (NUGs) or others, purchased through the NYISOs wholesale electricity or generated from its electric generating facilities.
For additional information about electric power purchases, see Electric Power Requirements in Item7 and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
For information about the companys contracts with NUGs for approximately 3,576 MW of electric generating capacity, see Note I to the financial statements in Item8.
For information about the companys current 704 MW of electric generating capacity, see Item2.
In 2002, the Governor of New York set a goal of having 25 percent of the electricity used in New York provided by renewable resources by 2013. In September 2004, the PSC issued an order, which provides that by 2013, 23.5 percent of the States energy needs would come from large renewable facilities such as wind, hydro, and biomass, 1 percent would come from green marketing efforts, and the remaining 0.5 percent is expected to come from on-site generation, limited to solar, fuel cells, and wind farms less than 300 kW in size. The PSC agreed with the Utilities that the responsibility for procuring the new renewable resources would rest with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and not the Utilities. NYSERDA is expected to enter into long-term agreements with developers that will pay renewable premiums to finance the construction of renewable projects. The renewable premiums plus NYSERDAs administrative fee are financed through a volumetric wires charge imposed on the delivery customers of each of the states utilities. Pursuant to the PSC order, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York billed customers renewable portfolio standard surcharges of $23 million and $21 million in 2007, respectively, and $12 million and $11 million in 2006, respectively. These surcharges may increase as NYSERDA increases its renewables commitments.
New York Independent System Operator.
The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of Con Edison of New York, as an integrated system and administers wholesale markets for electricity in New York State.
Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC), the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (either owned or contracted for) in an amount above the expected peak demand for their customers. NYSRC set the margin at 16.5 percent for the 2007/2008 capability year and, subject to approval by the appropriate regulatory agency at 15.0 percent for the 2008/2009 capability year, which begins May1, 2008. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough New York City-located capacity to cover a substantial percentage of their New York City customer peak demands. Con Edison of New York met the requirements applicable to it in 2007 and expects to meet them in 2008. As transmission owners participating in the NYISO, the Utilities may be required to construct projects that result from the NYISOs FERC-approved planning process.
Gas Operations Gas Sales.
Gas operating revenues in 2007 were $1.8 billion or 18 percent of Con Edison of New Yorks operating revenues. The percentages were 17 and 18 percent in the two preceding years. In 2007, 32 percent of the gas delivered by the company in its service area was sold by the company to its full-service (firm and interruptible) customers and 68 percent was sold by other suppliers. For additional information about gas sales, see Con Edison of New York Operating Statistics, below, and Results of Operations in Item7.
Gas Requirements and Peak Demand.
Firm demand for gas in Con Edison of New Yorks service area peaks during the winter heating season. The design criteria for the companys gas system assume severe weather conditions, which have not occurred since the 1933-34 winter. Under these criteria, the company estimated that its requirements to deliver gas to firm customers during the November 2007/March 2008 winter heating season would amount to 97,000 mdths (including 55,000 mdths to its firm sales customers and 42,000 mdths to its firm transportation customers). Through January14, 2008, the companys peak throughput day in this heating season occurred on January2, 2008, when it delivered 1,176 mdths of gas (including 564 mdths to its firm and interruptible sales customers, 77 mdths to NYPA, 375 mdths to its transportation customers and 160 mdths for use by the company in generating electricity and steam).
Under its design criteria, the company projects that for the November 2008/March 2009 winter heating season, its requirements for firm gas customers will amount to 98,000 mdths (including 55,700 mdths to firm sales customers and 42,300 mdths to firm transportation customers) and that the peak day requirements for these customers will amount to 1,332 mdths. The company expects to be able to meet these requirements.
10 Table of Contents Gas Supply.
Con Edison of New York and O&R have established a combined gas supply and capacity portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, Con Edison of New York (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the PSC. See Note R to the financial statements in Item8.
Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2012. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation and storage services. Charges under these contracts are approved by the FERC. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2023. The Utilities are required to pay certain charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $199 million in 2007, including $166 million for Con Edison of New York. See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesContractual Obligations in Item7. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and have interruptible gas transportation contracts. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
Steam Operations Steam Sales.
Con Edison of New York sells steam in Manhattan south of 96 th Street, mostly to large office buildings, apartment houses and hospitals. In 2007, steam operating revenues were $686 million or 7 percent of the companys operating revenues. The percentages were 7 percent in the two preceding years.
For additional information about Con Edison of New Yorks steam operations, see Regulatory Matters and Results of Operations in Item7, the discussion of Con Edison of New Yorks steam facilities in Item2 and Con Edison of New York Operating Statistics, below.
Steam Peak Demand and Capacity.
Demand for steam in Con Edison of New Yorks service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of 2007/2008 (through January31, 2008) occurred on January3, 2008 when the demand reached 8.4million pounds (mmlbs) per hour. The companys estimate for the winter of 2008/2009 peak demand of its steam customers is 10.6 mmlbs per hour under design criteria, which assume severe weather.
On December31, 2007, the steam system had the capability of delivering approximately 13.1 mmlbs of steam per hour and Con Edison of New York estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver this capacity in the 2008/2009 winter.
Steam Supply.
Fifty-one percent of the steam sold by Con Edison of New York in 2007 was produced in the companys steam-only generating stations; 34 percent was produced in the companys steam/electric generating stations, where it is first used to generate electricity; and 15 percent was purchased from others. See Item2 for a discussion of Con Edison of New Yorks steam facilities.
Regulation The PSC regulates, among other things, Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rates, the siting of its transmission lines and the issuance of its securities. Certain activities of the company are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. In addition, various matters relating to the construction and operation of the companys facilities are subject to regulation by other governmental agencies. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company. For additional information, including information about the companys electric, gas and steam rates, see Regulatory Matters in Item7.
The PSC from time to time conducts generic proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include those relating to utilities exiting the business of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities provider of last resort responsibility, the implementation of energy efficiency programs and consumer protections) and addressing any rate disincentives to the promotion of energy efficiency and distributed generation. The company typically is an active participant in such proceedings. The company does not expect that the pending generic proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
Competition Con Edison of New York is primarily a wires and pipes energy delivery company that:  has sold most of its electric generating capacity;  provides its customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas from other suppliers;  purchases substantially all of the electricity and all of the gas it sells to its full-service customers (the cost of which is recovered pursuant to provisions approved by the PSC); and  provides energy delivery services to customers pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.
See Rate Agreements in Note B and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for Con Edison of New York delivery customers. The company does not consider it 11 Table of Contents reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain PSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements and install facilities to provide the service. A new company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the PSC.
Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edison of New Yorks capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources and Capital Requirements and Financial and Commodity Market Risks in Item7.
Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenals (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of Con Edison of New York and its predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored. See Asbestos and Superfund in the discussion of Con Edison of New Yorks legal proceedings in Item3 and Note G to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edison of New Yorks capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $79 million in 2007 and are estimated to be $160 million in 2008.
Toxic Substances Control Act.
Virtually all electric utilities, including Con Edison of New York, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.
Water Quality.
Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of Con Edison of New Yorks service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.
Climate Change.
As indicated in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide are very likely changing the worlds climate.
Based on the most recent data (2006)published by the federal Department of Energy, Con Edison estimates that its greenhouse gas emissions constitute approximately 0.1 percent of the nations greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edisons emissions of greenhouse gases during the past five years (expressed in terms of millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) were: 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 7.0 6.9 8.3 8.1 7.9 The increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2007, as compared to 2006, reflects primarily increased steam production by Con Edison of New York during colder than normal winter weather and increased electric generation at the Con Edison Development generating projects (which are being soldsee Note U to the financial statements in Item8). Con Edison of New York significantly reduced its greenhouse gas emissions following 2005 when it replaced old generating facilities with its East River Repowering Project. The project, which consists of gas-fueled, combined-cycle combustion turbines, comprises almost 42 percent of the companys 704 MW of electric generating capacity, based on 2007 summer ratings.
The Companies are working to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edison of New York minimizes greenhouse gas emissions from its generating plants through the use of oil and gas fuels and cogeneration technologies that reduce emissions per unit of energy output. Also, it has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure, and by introducing new technologies. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing older equipment. The Utilities also reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency programs for customers.
Beginning in 2009, both Con Edison of New York and Con Edison Development will be subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations being established under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The initiative is a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states which will first cap and then reduce 12 Table of Contents carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to a level ten percent below current emissions by 2019. Under this program, affected electric generators will be required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, which will be available primarily through auctions administered by participating states or a secondary market. New Yorks proposed schedule is for auctions to begin in 2008 for portions of the 2009 and 2010 allowances.
Several bills have been introduced in Congress that would limit greenhouse gas emissions. Also, New York State has announced a goal to reduce forecast energy usage 15 percent from the levels predicted for 2015, and New York City is aiming to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2030.
The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the companys greenhouse gas emissions could be substantial.

Manufactured Gas Sites .Con Edison of New York and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for manufactured gas at sites in New York City and Westchester County (MGP Sites). Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than Con Edison of New York and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is requiring the company to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, which include 34 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.
The information available to Con Edison of New York for many of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required. Through the end of 2007, investigations have been started for all or portions of 35 MGP Sites, and have been completed at 11 of the sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas production/storage-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 27 MGP Sites, including locations within Manhattan and other parts of New York City and in Westchester County. Remediation has been completed at two sites and portions of eight other sites.
Astoria Site.
Con Edison of New York is permitted by the DEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its DEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The company has investigated various sections of the property and is performing additional investigations. The company has submitted to the DEC and the New York State Department of Health a report identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property will be at least $18 million.
Arthur Kill Site.
Following a September 1998 transformer fire at Con Edison of New Yorks former Arthur Kill Generating Station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of PCBs was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed DEC-approved cleanup programs for the stations facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July 1999 DEC consent order, the company completed a DEC-approved assessment of the nature and extent of the contamination in, and recommended a remediation program for the waterfront area of the station. DEC has selected the remediation program for the waterfront area and the company will implement it pursuant to an additional consent order entered into during 2005. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of PCB contamination at the site will be approximately $2.9 million.
Flushing Service Center Site.
The owner of a former Con Edison of New York service center facility in Flushing, New York, has informed the company that PCB contamination has been detected on a substantial portion of the property, which the owner has remediated, and is redeveloping for residential and commercial use pursuant to the New York Brownfield Cleanup Program administered by the DEC. The property owner has asserted a claim for $36 million for the costs of investigation and remediation of this site. The Company is negotiating with the property owner to resolve its liability. The DEC has also demanded that the company investigate PCB contamination in the adjacent Flushing River that may have emanated from this site. At this time, the company cannot estimate its liability for the investigation and cleanup of any PCB contamination that may have entered into the Flushing River from the site, but such liability may be substantial.
Other Superfund Sites.
Con Edison of New York is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.
20 Table of Contents The following table lists each of Con Edison of New Yorks other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under Start), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending, and the companys current estimate of its approximate potential liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring and environmental damages at the site or the unpaid share of any payments it is required to make under a settlement agreement resolving its liability for the site.

Superfund The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Four of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, three of which have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The DEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.
O&R has completed remedial investigations at all seven O&R MGP Sites. O&R has completed the remediation at one of its sites; is currently implementing remediation at its Nyack site; and has received DECs decision regarding the remedial work to be done at another site. Since the latter site is Company-owned and has no off-site impacts, remediation of this site has been deferred, with DECs concurrence, until approximately 2010.
West Nyack Site.
In 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with the DEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking underground storage tank was found as well. O&R has completed all remediation at the site that the DEC has required to date. O&R is conducting a supplemental groundwater investigation and an on-site vapor intrusion study that has been requested by the DEC.
Other Superfund Sites.
O&R is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and is expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2007 was $929 million or $3.49 a share. Net income for common stock in 2006 and 2005 was $737 million or $2.96 a share and $719 million or $2.95 a share, respectively. See Results of OperationsSummary, below.
Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. For segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements and Results of Operations, below.
For information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Companies, see Risk Factors, below.
Regulated Utilities Con Edison of New York provides electric service to approximately 3.2million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility businesses, provides electric service to approximately 0.3million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 0.1million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania.
The Utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The Utilities customers buy this energy from the Utilities, or from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets, and recover (generally on a current basis) the cost of the energy sold, pursuant to approved rate plans.
Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. The factors affecting demand for utility service include growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Demand for electric service peaks during the summer air conditioning season. Demand for gas and steam service peaks during the winter heating season.
28 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part past actual electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak usage. The weather during the summer of 2007 was cooler than design conditions. The highest peak electric demand reached in 2007 was 12,807 MW for Con Edison of New York on August8, 2007 and 1,474 MW for O&R on July10, 2007. The Utilities estimate that, under design weather conditions, the 2008 peak electric demand in their respective service areas will be 13,775 MW for Con Edison of New York and 1,645 MW for O&R. The Con Edison of New York forecasted peak demand includes the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately 1.2 percent for Con Edison of New York and 2.5 percent for O&R. The Companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that they currently provide (see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Requirements, below).
The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans are effective through March31, 2008,September30, 2010 and September30, 2008, respectively. In May 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) for new electric rates to be effective April1, 2008. In November 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request for a new steam rate plan, to be effective October1, 2008. O&Rs rate plans for its electric and gas service in New York and its subsidiarys electric service in New Jersey extend through June30, 2008,October31, 2009 and March31, 2010, respectively. In August 2007, O&R filed for new electric rates for its New York customers to be effective July10, 2008. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, charges to customers generally may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply, for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions. The New York rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on common equity capital. Changes in delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather-normalization or revenue decoupling provisions apply to the gas businesses, and subject to provisions in the rate plans for sharing above-target earnings with customers). See Regulatory Matters below and Recoverable Energy Costs and Rate Agreements in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements.
Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below.
Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edisons competitive energy businesses participate in segments of the electricity industry that are less comprehensively regulated than the Utilities. These segments include the operation of electric generation facilities, trading of electricity and fuel, sales of electricity to wholesale and retail customers and sales of certain energy-related goods and services. At December31, 2007, Con Edisons equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $615 million and their assets, including those held for sale (see below), amounted to $1.7 billion.
Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity directly to delivery-service customers of utilities primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions (including some of the Utilities customers) and also offers energy-related services. Con Edison Solutions does not sell electricity to the Utilities. The company sold approximately 12.2million MWHs of electricity to customers in 2007.
Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns, leases or operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects.

These risk factors include: The Utilities Revenues And Results Of Operations Reflect Regulatory Actions The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers. The prices are generally designed to cover the Utilities cost of service (including a return on equity) and generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards. Certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. Regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans. The regulators in the states in which the Utilities provide service generally permit the Utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service, other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred. Regulatory policies are subject to change. The Utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations. See Application of Critical Accounting Polices and Regulatory Matters, below.
Con Edisons Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Is Subject To Regulatory Restrictions Con Edisons ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are generally limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements.
The Companies Purchase Energy For Their Customers A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the Companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the Companies results of operations. The Companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply, including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterpartys non-performance. The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including the cost of hedging transactions, in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity-related price and volumetric risks. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below.
Energy Market Prices Are Volatile The impact of changing energy market prices on the Companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the Utilities recover energy supply costs. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below. High energy market prices result in increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage. If this were to occur, until the Utilities rates were adjusted to offset the effect of decreased usage, the Utilities would have decreased energy delivery revenues. Prices for electricity, fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses.
The Utilities Have A Substantial Ongoing Utility Construction Program The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $8 billion over the next three years. The ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission, substation and distribution system projects. The failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the Utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide. The Utilities expect to use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowing to fund the construction expenditures.
The Companies Are Active Participants in Financial Markets Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds. The Companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys), Standard& Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The interest rates on $636 million of Con Edison of New York tax-exempt debt and $99 million of O&R tax-exempt debt are also affected by the credit ratings of bond insurers. See Liquidity and Capital Resources  Capital Resources, below. Changes to financial market conditions could also adversely affect the return on investment of the plan assets for the Companies pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below.
The Companies Operate Essential Energy Facilities And Other Systems The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in, or close to, public places. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. See Power Outage Proceedings in Note B to the financial statements and 32 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Manhattan Steam Main Rupture in Note H to the financial statements. The Companies have information systems relating to their operations, billing, accounting and other matters, the failure of which could adversely affect the Companies operations and liquidity. In the event of failure or damage to these facilities or systems, the Utilities could incur substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The Utilities have training, operating, security, maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities and information systems.
Con Edisons Competitive Energy Businesses Are In Evolving Markets Con Edisons competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies, other organizations (such as independent system operators) and other competitive businesses. Compared to the Utilities, the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of Con Edisons investment in these competitive energy businesses is not as predictable.
The Companies May Be Affected By The Application Of Critical Accounting Policies And Rules The application of the Companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. These policies, which are described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below, include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities, the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other postretirement benefits, and accounting for contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. New accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies, rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the Companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities.
The Companies Are Exposed To Risks Relating To Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters in Item1 and Note G to the financial statements. Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are found wherever electricity is used. If a causal relationship between EMF and adverse health effects were established, there could be a material adverse effect on the Companies. Negative perceptions about EMF can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies operations.
The Companies Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Taxation The Companies operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service does not or may not agree, including tax positions with respect to Con Edisons lease in/lease out transactions and the deduction of certain construction-related costs for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. See Notes J and L to the financial statements. The Companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies.
The Companies Face Risks That Are Beyond Their Control The Companies results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Economic conditions can affect customers demand and ability to pay for service. The cost of repairing damage to the Companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to heat, storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, pandemic illnesses and other catastrophic events could be substantial. See Environmental MattersClimate Change in Item1 and Power Outage Proceedings in Note B to the financial statements. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the New York or United States economy. A lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect the Companies revenues and earnings and limit the Companies future growth prospects.

33 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases.
Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to SFAS No.71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No.71.
The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by SFAS No.71), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December31, 2007, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $4.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88, 106, and 132(R), SFAS No.87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No.106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. In addition, the Utilities apply SFAS No.71 to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2007, 2006 and 2005.
The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks current estimates for 2008 are decreases, compared with 2007, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $2 million and $3 million, respectively. The discount rate used to determine 2008 pension and other postretirement benefit accounting cost is 6.0 percent and the expected return on plan assets (tax-exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs) is 8.5 percent.
Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to decrease Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional $7 million in 2009. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2008, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.5 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $17 million and $16 million, respectively, in 2009.
The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moodys) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.
In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.
The following table illustrates the effect on 2008 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial 34 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 29 $ 4 $ 33 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 27 $ 3 $ 30 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 20 $ 2 $ 22 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 19 $ 2 $ 21 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % - $ 3 $ 3 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % - $ (1 ) $ (1 ) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 278 $ 44 $ 322 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 261 $ 38 $ 299 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % - $ 18 $ 18 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % - $ (3 ) $ (3 ) Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.
The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2007 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses made discretionary contributions to the plan in 2007 of $112 million, $36 million and $1 million, respectively, and expect to make discretionary contributions in 2008 of $98 million, $32 million and $1 million, respectively.
The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements.
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.5, Accounting for Contingencies, applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include service interruptions experienced in 2006 (Note B), the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes J and L); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with SFAS No.5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.
Accounting for Long-Lived Assets SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets requires that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No.144, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses test their assets for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long-lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the competitive energy businesses. Under SFAS No.144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of all possible outcomes must be weighted. With respect to the forecasted cash flows associated with Con Edison Developments generation facilities, a 10 percent 35 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these facilities would not result in an impairment charge. As a result of the 2005 tests, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax) with respect to Con Edison Communications. The 2006 tests did not result in an impairment charge. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW (see Note U to the financial statements). Based on the anticipated sales price of these assets, there was no impairment charge for 2007. See Impairments in Note A to the financial statements.
Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. See Note K to the financial statements. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
Goodwill was $408 million at December31, 2007. The most recent test, which was performed during 2007, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in the carrying value of any reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note O to the financial statements.
Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to SFAS No.133, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No.13, Accounting for Leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note J to the financial statements for information about Con Edison Developments Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the Internal Revenue Service and a possible future charge to earnings. In accordance with SFAS No.13, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below.
The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities, including, in 2007 and 2006, issuance of 14.6million and 12.2million shares of common stock for $685 and $510 million, respectively, of which $518 million and $447 million were invested in Con Edison of New York. In 2005, 2.8million shares of common stock were issued for $78 million.
The principal factors affecting Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowing to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short- 36 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities' cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.
Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See Risk Factors, and Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Contingencies, above, and Regulatory Matters, below.
Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (MillionsofDollars) 2007 2006 Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2005 Variance 2006 vs. 2005 Operating activities $ 1,555 $ 1,354 $ 201 $ 790 $ 564 Investing activities (2,086 ) (1,918 ) (168 ) (1,274 ) (644 ) Financing activities 647 577 70 539 38 Net change 116 13 103 55 (42 ) Balance at beginning of period 94 81 13 26 55 Balance at end of period $ 210 $ 94 $ 116 $ 81 $ 13 Con Edison of New York (MillionsofDollars) 2007 2006 Variance 2007 vs. 2006 2005 Variance 2006 vs. 2005 Operating activities $ 1,251 $ 1,163 $ 88 $ 818 $ 345 Investing activities (2,021 ) (1,839 ) (182 ) (1,167 ) (672 ) Financing activities 844 662 182 400 262 Net change 74 (14 ) 88 51 (65 ) Balance at beginning of period 47 61 (14 ) 10 51 Balance at end of period $ 121 $ 47 $ 74 $ 61 $ (14 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements.
Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges include depreciation and deferred income tax expense. Principal non-cash credits include the revenue requirement impact resulting from the reconciliation pursuant to Con Edison of New Yorks electric rate agreement of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation to the amounts reflected in electric rates (Net T&D Revenues), prepaid pension costs and amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities.
See Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Notes E and F to the financial statements.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $201 million and $88 million higher, respectively, than in the 2006 period primarily reflecting increased net income, depreciation expense, deferred income taxes and recovery of certain other receivables, described below, offset in part by higher non-cash credits for Net T&D Revenues, rate case amortizations and accruals and higher customer accounts receivable.
The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing issue is reflected within changes to accounts receivablecustomers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. The change in other deferred charges and noncurrent assets reflects a $160 million deposit paid by Con Edison to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the timing of deductions of certain construction related costs. See Note L to the financial statements. Con Edison of New Yorks portion of this deposit, also recorded as a noncurrent asset, was $147 million.

See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements.
The decrease in other receivables reflects primarily the recovery of a property tax credit associated with Con Edison of New Yorks East River Plant and lower hedging program broker margin deposits (reflecting higher commodity prices). For Con Edison, the decrease also reflects the expiration of certain wholesale load contracts, and receivables associated with other hedging activities at the competitive energy businesses.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2006 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $564 million and $345 million higher, respectively, than in the 2005 period. The increase in net cash flows reflects increased deferred tax benefits, the timing of Con Edison of New Yorks New York City property tax payments and higher energy prices in the last quarter of 2005. The company achieved a 1.5 percent reduction in its City property taxes for the fiscal year ending June30, 2006 by prepaying the annual tax amount due on June30, 2005 instead of paying semi-annual installments on their due dates (July 1, 2005 and January1, 2006). For the fiscal year ending June30, 2007, the company made a semi-annual installment on July1, 2006. The higher 2005 energy prices resulted in higher accounts receivable, net of allowance for uncollectibles, and accounts payable at the end of 2005 and increased collections of receivables from customers and accounts payable payments in the 2006 period. See Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities, below.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $168 million and $182 million higher, respectively, than in 2006. The increases for the Companies reflect primarily increased utility construction expenditures and lower net proceeds from the sale of certain properties ($30 million in 2007, as compared with $60 million in 2006). For Con Edison, the increase also reflects $39 million of net proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison Communications that offset cash flows used in investing activities in 2006.
Net cash flows used in investing activities in 2006 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $644 million and $672 million higher, respectively, than in 2005. The increases for the Companies reflect primarily increased utility construction expenditures and decreased net sale proceeds from the sale of certain properties ($60 million in 2006 as compared with $534 million in 2005). The $534 million represents proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison of New York properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan, collectively referred to as the First Avenue Properties, see Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B to the financial statements. For Con Edison, the increase was partially offset, relative to Con Edison of New York, by $39 million of net proceeds from the completion of the sale of Con Edison Communications in March 2006.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $70 million and $182 million in 2007 compared with 2006, and increased $38 million and $262 million, respectively, in 2006 compared with 2005.
Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 11million and 9.7million Con Edison common shares resulting in net proceeds of $558 million and $447 million, respectively. The 2007 proceeds were invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York ($518 million) and O&R ($40 million). The $447 million from the 2006 proceeds were invested in Con Edison of New York.
Cash flows from financing activities for 2007, 2006 and 2005 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2007: 3.6million shares for $121 million, 2006: 2.5million shares for $63 million, 2005: 2.8million shares for $78 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $38 million in 2007 and 2005 and $40 million in 2006.
Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 also reflect the following Con Edison of New York transactions: 2007  Issued $525 million 6.30% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes; and  Redeemed at maturity $330 million 6.45% 10-year debentures.
2006  Issued $400 million 5.85% 30-year debentures, $250 million 5.30% 10-year debentures and $250 million 5.70% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes;  Issued $400 million 6.20% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes and to redeem in advance of maturity $100 million 7.75% debentures due 2026; and 38 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED  Issued $400 million 5.50% 10-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $400 million 7.50% debentures due 2041.
2005  Issued $350 million 5.30% 30-year debentures, $125 million 5.25% 30-year debentures and $350 million 5.375% 10-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes;  Issued note for $126 million of variable-rate, tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2039, the proceeds of which were classified as restricted cash at June30, 2005 and used together with other funds to redeem in advance of maturity $128 million 6.10% fixed-rate tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2020; and  Redeemed at maturity $100 million 6.625% 10-year debentures and $350 million 6.625% 5-year debentures.
In 2007, Con Edison issued commercial paper and used available cash balances to redeem in advance of maturity $325 million 7.25% 40-year Public Income NotES.
Con Edisons net cash flows from financing activities also include O&Rs financings. In 2007, O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary redeemed at maturity $20 million 7.125% First Mortgage Bonds. In 2006, O&R issued $75 million of 5.45% 10-year debentures. In 2005, O&R issued $40 million of 5.30% 10-year debentures.
Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the average daily balances for 2007, 2006 and 2005 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were as follows: (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) 2007 2006 2005 Out- standing at Dec.31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec.31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec.31 Daily average Con Edison $ 840 $ 160 $ 117 $ 448 $ 755 $ 210 Con Edison of New York $ 555 $ 151 $ - $ 305 $ 520 $ 118 Weighted average yield 5.5 % 5.3 % 5.4 % 5.0 % 4.3 % 3.3 % Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions.

Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities at December31, 2007, compared with December31, 2006, that have not impacted the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows.
(Millions of Dollars) ConEdison 2007vs.2006 Variance ConEdisonof New York 2007 vs. 2006 Variance Assets Fair value of derivative assets $ (86 ) $ 10 Deferred derivative losses (205 ) (180 ) Liabilities Uncertain income taxes 155 142 Fair value of derivative liabilities (322 ) (148 ) For information on the adoption of FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, see Note L to the financial statements.
In the context of higher forward energy market prices and the realization of gains and losses in 2007, the Companies policies for managing their energy purchases resulted in a decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities at December31, 2007 as compared with year-end 2006. For Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, the decrease in the fair value of derivative liabilities resulted in a decrease in deferred derivative losses at December31, 2007 as compared with year-end 2006. For the Utilities, mark-to-market activity had no effect on net income as the amounts were deferred as regulatory assets/liabilities (deferred derivative losses/gains). In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers their energy supply costs, net of gains and losses on derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases. The mark-to-market accounting for Con Edisons competitive energy businesses resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities. The decline in the fair value of derivative assets reflects increasing capacity prices and the timing of entering into new derivative instruments, which was offset in part by the maturity of certain derivative instruments and the impact of increasing energy prices. The competitive energy businesses record mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative instruments in earnings in the reporting period in which such changes occur. See Note O to the financial statements. For the Companies, changes in fair value of derivative instruments may lead to collateral payments made to or received from counterparties or brokers that are reflected in other accounts receivable and other current liabilities.
Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital 39 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED requirements primarily through the sale of securities including the issuance in 2008 of between $225 million and $425 million of Con Edison common shares in addition to issuances under its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans and from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.
Con Edison expects to use the net proceeds from Con Edison Developments and its subsidiarys pending sale of their ownership interests in power generating projects to repay debt and invest the remaining proceeds in its subsidiaries. See Note U to the financial statements.
For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements.
For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements.
The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings.
The Companies are continuing to monitor developments in the capital markets, and currently believe that the Companies' will be able to access capital on reasonable terms.
In May 2005, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $4.4 billion of debt securities prior to December31, 2009, of which the company had issued $2.2 billion at December31, 2007. In January 2006, the PSC authorized O&R to issue up to $325 million of debt securities prior to December31, 2009, of which the company had issued $75million as of December31, 2007. In addition, the PSC has authorized the Utilities to refund outstanding debt securities and preferred stock should the Utilities determine that it is economic to do so.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings. See Note P to the financial statements.
For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was: Earnings to Fixed Charges (Times) 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison 3.4 3.0 3.3 2.8 3.2 Con Edison of New York 3.6 3.2 3.6 3.1 3.4 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was: Common Equity Ratio (Percent of total capitalization) 2007 2006 2005 Con Edison 53.7 48.5 49.0 Con Edison of New York 52.3 50.0 50.7 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P-1, A-2 and F1, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Con Edisons unsecured debt is rated A2, A- and A, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of Con Edison of New York is rated A1, A and A+, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated A2, A and A+, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Con Edison of New York has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by XL Capital Assurance Inc. Credit rating agencies have recently downgraded the ratings of these insurers from AAA to lower levels. The company believes that the interest rates on its insured tax-exempt debt have been adversely impacted by the downgrade. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax-exempt debt was 3.75 percent on February20, 2008. The weighted average interest rate was 3.77 percent, 3.45 percent and 2.44 percent for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
O&R has $99 million of tax-exempt debt that currently bears interest at rates determined weekly and is subject to tender by bondholders for purchase by the company. Of this amount, $55 million is insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and $44 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation. Recent downgrades in the credit ratings of these insurers have resulted in interest rates on this O&R debt that are significantly higher than the interest rates borne by Con Edison of New Yorks $225 million of uninsured weekly rate tender bonds. As of February 20, 2008, the weighted average annual interest rate on the O&R insured weekly rate tender bonds, excluding the effects of an interest rate swap agreement (see Interest Rate Hedging in Note B to the financial statements), was 5.61 percent and the rate on the Con Edison of New York weekly rate tender bonds was 2.22 percent. O&R is evaluating alternatives with respect to its tax-exempt debt, which could include redemption of the debt and termination of the interest rate swap agreement.

The Utilities have an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet the growth in demand for electricity and electric, gas and steam reliability needs. Amounts for 2005 also include expenditures for the East River Repowering Project. The increases in 2006 and 2007 reflect a higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system. The Utilities estimated construction expenditures for 2008, 2009, and 2010 are subject to change depending on the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings. See Note B to the financial statements.

(b) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.
(c) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the Other Purchase Obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their purchasing systems to enable them to report their Other Purchase Obligations in a different manner.
(d) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity and generating plant services entered into by Con Edison's competitive energy businesses. These obligations do not include any obligations related to the generation projects being sold. See Note U to the financial statements.
42 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F, O and Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements.
Electric Power Requirements In 2007, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts and through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2008.
In general, the Utilities recover prudently-incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial and Commodity Market RisksCommodity Price Risk," below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in 2008. See Notes I and O to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2008.
Con Edison of New York also owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December31, 2007, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 704 MW, based on 2007 summer ratings. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity.
In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New York's request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. In December 2007, the PSC initiated a proceeding to consider a form of integrated resource planning, which could involve the imposition of obligations on transmission owners (such as Con Edison of New York), that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses sell electricity to wholesale and retail customers in the NYISO, PJM Interconnection (PJM), ISO New England (ISO-NE) and other markets. In addition, at December31, 2007, Con Edison Development owned equity interests in electric generating facilities equivalent to 1,739 MW of net generating capacity, substantially all of which is located within the PJM or the ISO-NE. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities on the wholesale electricity markets or under contract. See Financial and Commodity Market RisksCommodity Price Risk, below. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in these power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 MW. See Note U to the financial statements.

In May 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for an electric rate increase of $1,225 million effective April1, 2008. The PSC is expected to rule on the companys request in March 2008. O&R has pending a request with the PSC for an increase in the rates it charges for electric service rendered in New York, effective July 2008, of $43.7 million. See Note B to the financial statements.
The Companies are actively participating in regulatory proceedings at the federal level that are underway to implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005, such as the implementation of mandatory reliability standards through the North American Electric Reliability Council and efforts to increase investment in infrastructure, including implementation of transmission pricing incentives. The Companies also participate in other federal regulatory proceedings that affect electric capacity and energy markets in New York and PJM regions, and those that affect gas pipeline companies.
44 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Companies estimate that at December31, 2007, each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of $7 million and $5 million, respectively.
In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note O to the financial statements.
Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements.
Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2007, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $99 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $64 million is for Con Edison of New York and $35 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December31, 2007, and 2006, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2007 2006 (MillionsofDollars) Average for the period $ 3 $ 3 High 7 10 Low 1 1 Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff.
The Utilities had $66 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2007, of which $28 million was with investment-grade counterparties and $38 million was with commodity exchange brokers.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses had $92 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2007, of which $71 million was with investment grade counterparties and $21 million was with commodity exchanges or independent system operators.

See Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December31, 2007, the pension plan investments consisted of 65 percent equity and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. See Notes E and F to the financial statements.
Environmental Matters For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Environmental Matters in Item1 and Note G to the financial statements.
Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially.
Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Contingencies, and Notes B, G, H, J and L to the financial statements.
Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above), rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Regulatory Matters, above) and demand for utility service. Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors.
The Companies results of operations for the 12 months ended December31, 2007 reflect sales growth, the Utilities rate plans (which are designed to recover increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and interest charges), the impact of storms and weather in 2007. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of OperationsSummary, above.
In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations.
Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 follows.

Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 12.7 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting the impact of the weather in 2007. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3 percent higher in 2007 compared with 2006. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income.
Non-firm transportation of customer-owned gas to electric generating plants increased in 2007 compared with 2006 because certain facilities resumed burning gas to generate electricity. The increase in gas burned had minimal impact on earnings because most revenues from these customers result from a fixed demand charge for local transportation.
Gas operating income increased by $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase reflects higher net revenues ($13 million) and lower taxes other than income taxes ($1 million, principally property taxes), offset in part by higher operations and maintenance costs ($7 million), income taxes ($1 million) and depreciation ($1 million).

Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) decreased $3 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to the sale of non-utility property and higher interest income in 2006.
Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $6 million in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to a new debt issuance in late 2006 and interest accrued for the potential repayment of tax benefits from the timing of tax deductions of certain construction related costs (see Note L to the financial statements).
Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses operating income and earnings from continuing operations increased $2 million and $18 million, respectively, in 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to higher gross margins from generating plants and wholesale sales, higher income from investments and lower mark-to-market losses, offset in part by lower gross margins from electric retail sales.
Operating revenues increased $384 million in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to higher electric wholesale and retail revenues. Electric wholesale revenues increased $134 million, of which $150 million was due to higher sales volume, offset by a $16 million decrease in unit prices. Electric retail revenues increased $190 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, of which $173 million was due to higher sales volumes and $17 million was due to an increase in unit prices. While electric retail revenues increased more than 16 percent from 2006 to 2007, gross margins decreased by approximately 20 percent due primarily to lower margins on indexed priced products. Revenue from the sale of electricity from the competitive energy businesses generation facilities increased $26 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to higher capacity prices. Net mark-to-market losses decreased $17 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to higher prices on electric and natural gas contracts, which were economic hedges that supported retail obligations (but were not accounted for as cash flow hedges). Other revenues increased $17 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to energy services revenue.
Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased $373 million in 2007 compared with 2006, reflecting increased purchased power ($348 million), other operations and maintenance costs ($19 million) and fuel costs ($8 million) offset in part by lower gas purchased for resale costs ($2 million).
Other income increased $12 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 due primarily to a $6 million gain from the sale of an equity investment.
Income taxes increased $10 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, reflecting primarily higher income.
Discontinued Operations Net income from discontinued operations was $4 million in 2007 compared with a $3 million loss in 2006, reflecting lower mark-to-market losses in 2007 from certain Con Edison Development generation projects. See Note U to the financial statements.

The increase is due primarily to higher costs of gas purchased for resale in 2006.
Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 12.6 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting the impact of the milder winter and spring weather in 2006. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 2.8 percent lower in 2006 compared with 2005 partially due to reduced customer usage. O&Rs revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income.
Non-firm transportation of customer-owned gas to electric generating plants increased in 2006 compared with 2005 because certain facilities resumed burning gas to generate electricity. The increase in gas burned had minimal impact on earnings because most revenues from these customers result from a fixed demand charge for local transportation.
Gas operating income decreased by $1 million in 2006 compared with 2005.

Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased by $6 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to lower income in the 2006 period.
Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to the sale of non-utility property and increased interest income.
Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $4 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to higher interest rates on and principal amounts of commercial paper and new debt issuances in the 2006 period.
Competitive Energy Businesses The competitive energy businesses operating income and earnings from continuing operations increased $28 million and $27 million, respectively, in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to higher operating revenues and gross margins on wholesale and retail electric sales, offset in part by higher mark-to-market losses.
Operating revenues increased $629 million in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to higher electric wholesale and retail revenues offset in part by decreased generation and other revenues and increased net mark-to-market losses. Electric wholesale revenues increased $602 million, of which $564 million was due to higher sales volume and $38 million was due to an increase in unit prices. Electric retail revenues increased $124 million in 2006 as compared with 2005, of which $71 million was due to higher sales volumes and $53 million was due to an increase in unit prices. While electric retail revenues increased more than 12 percent from 2005 to 2006, gross margins increased at a greater rate as more customers shifted from indexed contracts to fixed-price contracts as energy prices declined during the year. Renewal rates for customers have remained above 90 percent for the past two years. Revenue from the sale of electricity from the competitive energy businesses generation facilities was $49 million lower, reflecting lower unit prices and volumes, partially offset by reliability-related capacity payments for two of its Massachusetts generating facilities. The development of capacity markets in New England and PJM is expected to result in more predictable capacity revenues. Net mark-to-market losses increased $12 million in 2006 as compared with 2005 due primarily to lower prices on natural gas contracts, which were economic hedges that supported retail obligations (but did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting). Other revenue, primarily wholesale revenue and intercompany revenue, decreased $36 million.
Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased $583 million in 2006 compared with 2005, reflecting increased purchased power ($624 million) and other operations and maintenance costs ($19 million), offset in part by lower fuel costs ($42 million), gas purchased for resale costs ($17 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($1 million).
Income taxes increased $19 million in 2006 as compared with 2005, reflecting primarily higher income.
Other income (deductions) decreased $1 million in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to an impairment of $6 million on an equity investment (see Impairments in Note A to the financial statements), offset in part by higher interest income.
Discontinued Operations Losses from discontinued operations were $23 million lower in 2006 as compared with 2005 due primarily to losses from Con Edison Communications in 2005 ($13 million) and higher margins from certain Con Edison Development generation projects in 2006 ($10 million). See Notes T and U to the financial statements.
Other For Con Edison, Other in 2006 reflects a $9 million expense (which will not be recoverable under the Utilities rate plans) for a charitable commitment to the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and a $9 million expense to effectively reclassify from retained earnings to additional paid-in capital the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options that had been recognized in income in prior years. For Con Edison, Other also includes inter-company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses.

61 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Con Edison is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of Con Edison assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in I nternal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on that assessment, management has concluded that Con Edison had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.
The effectiveness of Con Edisons internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Con Edisons independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Kevin Burke Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Robert Hoglund Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February15, 2008 62 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Consolidated Edison, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Notes E and F to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2006.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

71 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of Con Edison of New York is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of Con Edison of New York assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on that assessment, management has concluded that Con Edison of New York had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.
The effectiveness of Con Edison of New Yorks internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Con Edison of New Yorks independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Kevin Burke Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Hoglund Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February15, 2008 72 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholder and Board of Trustees of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits (which was an integrated audit in 2007). We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Notes E and F to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2006.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

81 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements General These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the separate consolidated financial statements of each of the two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison of New York). Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, which are presented separately in the Con Edison of New York consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Con Edisons other utility subsidiary, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses (discussed below) in Con Edisons consolidated financial statements. The term Utilities is used in these notes to refer to Con Edison of New York and O&R.
As used in these notes, the term Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, Con Edison of New York makes no representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.
Con Edison has two regulated utility subsidiaries: Con Edison of New York and O&R. Con Edison of New York provides electric service and gas service in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. Con Edison has the following competitive energy businesses: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity and also offers energy-related services; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; and Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns, leases or operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects. In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 megawatts. See Note U to the financial statements.
Note ASummary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Companies consolidated financial statements include the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (see Note P), as required. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No.71.
The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Other significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced below in this Note A and in the notes that follow.
Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property is charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement, the original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation. See Note Q.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate of return on the Utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC or the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to 82 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the Utilities own funds are credited to other income (deductions). The AFDC rates for Con Edison of New York were 7.3 percent, 6.7 percent and 7.4 percent for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The AFDC rates for O&R were 5.2 percent, 5.0 percent and 3.9 percent for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The Utilities generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors. The average depreciation rate for Con Edison of New York was 2.9 percent for 2007, 2006 and 2005. The average depreciation rates for O&R were 2.8 percent for 2007 and 2006 and 2.9 percent for 2005.
The estimated lives for utility plant for Con Edison of New York range from 5 to 80 years for electric, 5 to 85 years for gas, 5 to 70 years for steam and 5 to 50 years for general plant. For O&R, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 65 years for electric, 5 to 75 years for gas and 5 to 55 years for general plant.
At December31, 2007 and 2006, the capitalized cost of the Companies utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, was as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (MillionsofDollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Electric Generation $ 344 $ 319 $ 344 $ 319 Transmission 1,857 1,675 1,733 1,564 Distribution 10,498 9,612 9,954 9,095 Gas* 2,729 2,599 2,424 2,307 Steam 1,458 1,430 1,458 1,430 General 1,142 1,069 1,055 990 Held for future use 57 47 52 43 Construction work in progress 1,028 872 973 832 Net utility plant $ 19,113 $ 17,623 $ 17,993 $ 16,580 * Primarily distribution.
Non-Utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication facilities that are currently not used within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edisons competitive energy businesses, non-utility plant consists primarily of electric generating facilities. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 75 years. See Note U.
The average non-utility plant depreciation rates for Con Edison Development were 2.5 percent for 2007 and 2.8 percent for 2006 and 2005.
Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. See Note K.
Impairments In accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Companies evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets, based on projections of undiscounted future cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event an evaluation indicates that such cash flows cannot be expected to be sufficient to fully recover the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, Con Edison Development recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $7 million and $6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively related to its equity investment in a 29 MW electric generating plant in Michigan. Con Edison also wrote-off its cost-based investment of $6 million in 2007 related to a supply chain services company due to a decline in the investments value that was deemed to be other than temporary.
Revenues The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas and steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period net interruptible gas revenues, other than those authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to be retained by the Utilities, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. O&R and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy service not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edisons balance sheet at December31, 2007 and 2006 were $149 million and $122 83 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued million, respectively. Con Edison of New York estimates its unbilled revenues at December31, 2007 and 2006 to be approximately $410 million and $357 million, respectively.
The PSC requires utilities to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is generally provided for in the revenue requirement within each of the respective PSC approved rate plans.
Recoverable Energy Costs The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy supply costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference in most cases is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed electric and steam supply costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). In addition, Con Edison of New York recovers the costs of its electric demand management program, in excess of the costs reflected in rates, as part of recoverable energy costs. For the Utilities gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a subsequent 12-month period.
New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) The Utilities purchase electricity through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The difference between purchased power and related costs initially billed to the Utilities by the NYISO and the actual cost of power subsequently calculated by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities customers. See Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B.
Certain other payments to or receipts from the NYISO are also subject to reconciliation, with shortfalls or amounts in excess of specified rate allowances recoverable from or refundable to customers. These include proceeds from the sale through the NYISO of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system (Transmission Congestion Contracts or TCCs). See Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B.
Sulfur Dioxide Allowances In accordance with the federal Clean Air Act, Con Edison of New York has been allocated sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances which the company may sell, trade or hold for future use. Generally, Con Edison of New York defers its proceeds from the sale of SO 2 allowances as regulatory liabilities to be applied for customer benefit. See Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B. For the competitive energy businesses, sales of SO 2 allowances are reflected in earnings in the periods in which the sales occur. The proceeds received from the sale of SO 2 allowances are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows.
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly-liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses, which are accounted for under the equity method (depending on the subsidiaries percentage ownership) or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No.13, Accounting for Leases. See Note J for a discussion of investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions. Utilities investments are recorded at either cost or cash surrender value and include deferred income plans and supplemental retirement income plans trust owned life insurance assets.
Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or turn-around of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense. See Notes B and L. In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No.109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates. In January 2007, the Companies adopted FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Statement No.109. See Note L.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.
84 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays or receives an amount based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.
State Income Tax Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives an amount based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
Research and Development Costs Generally research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs were as follows: FortheYearsEndedDecember31, (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Con Edison $ 15 $ 14 $ 14 Con Edison of New York $ 14 $ 13 $ 14 Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Earnings Per Common Share In accordance with SFAS No.128, Earnings per Share, Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share (EPS) are calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders (Net income on Con Edisons consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.
Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and stock options for which the average market price of the common shares for the period was greater than the exercise price. See Note M.
Basic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows: FortheYearsEnded December31, (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts/Shares in Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Income from continuing operations $ 925 $ 740 $ 745 Gain/(Loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 4 (3 ) (26 ) Net income $ 929 $ 737 $ 719 Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic 266.3 249.3 243.9 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities 1.0 1.0 0.8 Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding  Diluted 267.3 250.3 244.7 Earnings per Common Share  Basic Continuing operations $ 3.48 $ 2.97 $ 3.05 Discontinued operations 0.01 (0.01 ) (0.10 ) Net income $ 3.49 $ 2.96 $ 2.95 Earnings per Common Share  Diluted Continuing operations $ 3.46 $ 2.96 $ 3.04 Discontinued operations 0.01 (0.01 ) (0.10 ) Net income $ 3.47 $ 2.95 $ 2.94 The computation of diluted earnings per share does not exclude any Con Edison common shares for the year ended December31, 2007 because the exercise prices on the options did not exceed the average closing market price during this period. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes 0.1million and 0.9million Con Edison common shares for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, because the exercise prices on the options exceeded the average closing market price during these periods.
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
85 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Note BRegulatory Matters Rate Agreements Con Edison of New YorkElectric In March 2005, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for electric delivery service (the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement). The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement covers the three-year period April 2005 through March 2008, pursuant to which Con Edison of New Yorks electric base rates were increased $104.6 million, effective April1, 2005, and were increased an additional $220.4 million (of which $60 million was accrued over the period beginning April1, 2006 to March31, 2007), effective April1, 2007. In addition, the company retains the first $60 million of auction proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on the companys transmission system in each of the three years. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization is a non-cash increase in electric revenues of $128 million, $173 million and $249 million in the first, second and third rate years, respectively.
The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement provides for annual reconciliations of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation (Net T&D) and the actual amount of certain operating costs experienced over the term of the agreement, as compared in each case to the amounts reflected in electric rates.
If the actual Net T&D is greater than the Net T&D reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory asset and increase its revenues by the revenue requirement impact of such difference (i.e., a return on investment, depreciation and income taxes). If the actual Net T&D is less than the Net T&D reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory liability and decrease its revenues by the revenue requirement impact of such difference. For the period from April1, 2005 through December31, 2007, actual Net T&D has exceeded the Net T&D reflected in rates by $1.4 billion. The company accrued revenues of $187 million, $115 million and $38 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to reflect the revenue requirement impact of the Net T&D difference. In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, the accrued revenues were offset at the end of each rate year with a like amount of regulatory liabilities.
Under the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, if the actual amount of pension or other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs and, if the variation exceeds 2.5 percent, property taxes or the cost of moving facilities to avoid interfering with government projects is greater than the respective amount for each such cost reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory asset for the difference and defer recognition in income of the difference. If the actual amount is less than the amount reflected in electric rates, the company will accrue a regulatory liability for the difference and defer recognition in income of the difference. As a result of the cost reconciliations, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company deferred expenses of $35 million, $30 million and $17 million, respectively.
Under the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, for each rate year, any earnings attributable to the companys electric business, excluding the effect of the incentives and revenue reductions discussed below, (Adjusted Earnings) between an 11.4 percent and a 13 percent return on equity (based on the companys actual capitalization, subject to a maximum ratio of 50 percent) are to be used to offset 50 percent of any regulatory asset to be recorded in that year resulting from the cost reconciliations. See Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, below in this Note B. The company can retain 50 percent of any remaining above-target Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers. If Adjusted Earnings exceed a 13 percent return, no regulatory asset resulting from the cost reconciliations is to be accrued, but the company can retain 25 percent of the above-target Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers.
In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, at December31, 2005, Con Edison of New York estimated that its Adjusted Earnings for the rate year ending March31, 2006 would exceed an 11.4 percent return on equity by $59 million, of which $47 million was accounted for as an offset to regulatory assets arising from the cost reconciliations and $6 million was reserved for customer benefit. Actual Adjusted Earnings for the rate year exceeded this target by $38 million. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2006, the company reduced the regulatory asset offset by $9 million and eliminated the $6 million reserve for customer benefit (which had the effect of increasing revenues for 2006 by $15 million). At December31, 2007 and 2006, Con Edison of New York estimated that its Adjusted Earnings for the rate years ending March31, 2007 and March31, 2008 would not exceed an 11.4 percent return on equity.
The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement also provides for the continuation of the rate provisions pursuant to which the company recovers its potential strandable costs and its purchased power and fuel costs from customers.
The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement includes potential positive earnings adjustments (incentives) if the company meets certain standards for its retail access and demand side management programs, and potential negative earnings adjustments (revenue reductions), which could be substantial, if it does not meet certain standards for (i)frequency and duration of service interruptions; (ii)major outages; (iii)repair, removal or 86 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued replacement of damaged poles, temporary shunts, street lights, traffic signals and circuit breakers; and (iv)customer service. In 2007, the company recorded an incentive for demand side management initiatives of $11 million. In 2007 and 2006, the company recorded incentives of $4 million and $6 million, respectively, associated with its efforts to promote retail access in its service territory. In 2007 and 2006, the company recorded revenue reductions of $9 million and $18 million, respectively, for not meeting certain standards for frequency and duration of service interruptions and in 2005, $8 million was recorded for duration of service interruptions. See Power Outage Proceedings below in Note B.
In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, the company recognized a $100 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to prior period pension credits.
In May 2007, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for an electric rate increase of $1,225 million effective April1, 2008. The PSC is expected to rule on the companys request in March 2008.
In January 2008, PSC administrative law judges (ALJs) issued a decision recommending that the PSC grant the company an electric rate increase, effective April1, 2008, of approximately $600 million. The ALJs also recommended that the PSC consider making up to $330 million of the rate increase, which relates to the companys construction expenditures, temporary and subject to refund to customers pending the results of a management and operations audit to be performed by an auditor to be selected by the PSC. Additionally, the ALJs recommended that a total of $200 million of regulatory assets relating to the Net T&D reconciliation that were offset against regulatory liabilities in 2006 and 2007 also be subject to refund pending the results of the audit. The ALJs recommended decision reflected the following major items:  a return on common equity of 9.0 percent instead of the return on common equity of 11.5 percent requested by the company;  increasing to $150 million from $60 million the level of revenues that, for purposes of setting rates, is assumed the company will receive and retain from the sale of transmission rights on the companys transmission system;  a higher sales forecast, certain rate base reductions, decreases in advertising and certain other programs and longer amortization periods for certain regulatory assets;  a one-year rate period, which would discontinue the provisions of the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement under which property taxes, environmental remediation expenses and costs to move facilities to avoid interfering with government projects are reconciled to amounts reflected in rates;  that the potential negative earnings adjustment (revenue reductions) provisions of the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement be continued and expanded at amounts at or above current levels, to be determined by the PSC; and  a revenue decoupling mechanism.
In general, revenue decoupling mechanisms are intended to promote energy efficiency by breaking the linkage between energy sales and utility revenues and/or profits and, thereby, eliminate the disincentive a utility would have to promote energy efficiency. Under a revenue decoupling mechanism, the utilitys actual energy delivery revenues would be compared, on a periodic basis, with the authorized delivery revenues or revenues per customer, with the difference accrued, with interest, for refund to, or recovery from, customers, as applicable.
O&RElectric In October 2003, the PSC approved an agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covered the period from July 2003 through October 2006, provided for no changes to electric base rates and provided for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which was to reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million (pre tax) over the period covered by the agreement. The agreement provided for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis. It also provided for O&R to share equally with customers earnings above a 12.75 percent return on common equity during the three-year period from July 2003 through June 2006. Beginning July 2006, O&R was not subject to earnings sharing. Pursuant to these provisions, $3.6 million and $6.7 million was deferred for future customer benefit in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
In October 2007, the PSC issued an order that continues O&Rs rates for electric service rendered in New York at current levels. The order, which is based on an allowed annual rate of return on common equity of 9.1 percent increased, effective July1, 2007, by $13.1 million annually the amount recognized for pension and other postretirement benefit costs. Because O&R, in accordance with applicable New York regulatory provisions, defers the difference between the actual amount of such costs and the amounts for such costs reflected in rates, the effect of the increase was to decrease the companys deferrals of such costs and increase other operations and maintenance expense by a like amount. As required by the order, the company also reduced other operating revenues and recorded a regulatory liability of $3million for earnings attributable to its New York electric business in excess of a 9.1 percent annual rate of return on 87 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued common equity applicable to the period March through June 2007. In June 2007, O&R commenced an action in New York State Supreme Court seeking to annul the March 2007 PSC order that initiated the proceeding in which the October 2007 order was issued.
In August 2007, O&R filed a request with the PSC for an increase in the rates it charges for electric service rendered in New York, effective July 2008, of $47.8 million. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11.5 percent and a common equity ratio of 48.6 percent. The filing proposes continuation of the current provisions with respect to recovery from customers of the cost of purchased power, and the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to the electric business to the amounts for such costs reflected in electric rates for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental and research and development costs. In October 2007, O&R submitted to the PSC a revenue decoupling proposal applicable to the companys electric service in New York. In November 2007, O&R updated its rate request to reflect the impact of applying all available credits, including $3.3 million of earnings above the 9.1 percent allowed ROE during March through June 2007, as directed by the PSC in its October 2007 Order. The impact of this and other changes reduced the requested rate increase to $43.7 million. In December 2007, PSC Staff submitted direct testimony and exhibits supporting a $17.5 million rate increase, based on a return on equity of 8.9 percent and an equity ratio of 48 percent. A decision in this case is expected in June 2008.
In July 2003, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), O&Rs New Jersey regulated utility subsidiary, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7 million decrease in RECOs electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECOs recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest.
In July 2004, the NJBPU approved RECOs Phase II petition to increase base rates annually by $2.7 million, effective August1, 2004. The Phase II decision provides for the recovery of carrying costs for two substation projects and specified additional reliability programs. Also in July 2004, a special purpose entity formed by RECO (which is included in the consolidated financial statements of Con Edison) issued $46 million of 5.22% Transition Bonds and used the proceeds thereof to purchase from RECO the right to be paid a Transition Bond Charge (TBC) and associated tax charges by its customers relating to the balance of previously deferred purchased power costs, discussed above.
In March 2007, the NJBPU approved a new three-year electric base rate plan for RECO that went into effect on April1, 2007.
The plan provides for a $6.4 million rate increase during the first year, with no further increase during the final two years. The plan reflects a return on common equity of 9.75 percent and a common equity ratio of 46.5 percent of capitalization.
Con Edison of New YorkGas In September 2004, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company could charge its customers for gas and steam services. The approved gas rate plan covered the three-year period October 2004 through September 2007, and provided for an increase in gas base rates of $46.8 million, effective October1, 2004, with deferral accounting to be used to allocate the income statement effect of the increase over the term of the agreement. The rate increase was net of a $17.5 million pre-tax charge to gas operating revenues, which the company recognized in 2004, to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. In addition to this rate increase, the company retained the first $35 million of net revenues from non-firm customer transactions in each year of the plan. The rate increase also included the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization was a non-cash increase in gas revenues of $41 million over the period of the three-year rate plan.
Additional provisions of the gas rate plan included: equal sharing with customers of earnings above an 11.75 percent return on common equity (earnings for the rate years ended September 2005, 2006 and 2007 were below this level); reconciliation of pension and other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the gas business to the amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers; opportunities to retain for shareholders a percentage of annual gas net revenues from non-firm customer transactions (20 percent of revenues between $35 million and $50 million, 25 percent between $50 million and $70 million and 10 percent over $70 million), and to earn an incentive of up to $8.5 million over the period of the rate plan depending upon the number of customers that migrate to retail access; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of purchased gas and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; continuation of provisions pursuant to which the effects of weather on gas income are moderated; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.
In September 2007, the PSC approved the Joint Proposal that Con Edison of New York had entered into in June 2007 with the staff of 88 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for gas service. The Joint Proposal had provided for rate increases of $84.6 million, $32.7 million and $42.7 million, effective October1, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, along with annual funding for new energy efficiency programs of $14 million. The PSC modified the Joint Proposal to provide for levelized annual rate increases of $67.5 million in each year of the three year rate plan, by accruing, over the first rate year as gas service is provided, $31.1 million of revenues and a related regulatory asset, which, together with interest, will be billed to customers in the second and third rate years.
The Joint Proposal continues the previous gas rate plan provisions with respect to recovery from customers of the cost of purchased gas and environmental remediation expenses; continuation of provisions pursuant to which the effects of weather on gas income are moderated; and the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to the gas business to the amounts for such costs reflected in gas rates for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, property taxes and interference costs. Additional provisions of the gas rate plan include: a revenue decoupling mechanism and equal sharing with customers of earnings above a 10.7 percent return on common equity (earnings for the year ended December31, 2007 include a $10 million regulatory liability for earnings above the 10.7 percent threshold for the rate year ending September30, 2008).
O&RGas In October 2003, the PSC approved a gas rate agreement among O&R, the PSC staff and other parties. This agreement, which covered the period November 2003 through October 2006, provided for annual increases in gas base rates of $9 million effective November 2003, $9 million effective November 2004 and $5 million effective November 2005. The agreement provided for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity. Earnings for the rate years ended October 2004, 2005 and 2006 were below this level. The rate agreement also included the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization was a non-cash increase in gas revenues of $2 million over the period of the three-year rate plan.
In October 2006, the PSC approved the June 2006 settlement agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties. The settlement agreement establishes a rate plan that covers the three-year period November1, 2006 through October31, 2009. The rate plan provides for rate increases in base rates of $12 million in the first year, $0.7 million in the second year and $1.1 million in the third year. To phase-in the effect of the increase for customers, the rate plan provides for O&R to accrue revenues for, but defer billing to customers of, $5.5 million of the first rate year rate increase by establishing a regulatory asset which, together with interest, will be billed to customers in the second and third years. As a result, O&Rs billings to customers will increase $6.5 million in each of the first two years and $6.3 million in the third. The first year rate increase includes $2.3 million relating to a change in the way customers are provided the benefit of non-firm revenue from sales of pipeline transportation capacity. Under the prior rate plan, base rates were reduced to reflect the assumption that the company would realize these revenues. Under the new rate plan, such revenues will be used to offset the cost of gas to be recovered from customers. The rate plan continues the provisions pursuant to which the company recovers its cost of purchasing gas and the provisions pursuant to which the effects of weather on gas income are moderated.
The rate plan provides that if the actual amount of pension or other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, property taxes and certain other costs vary from the respective amount for each such cost reflected in gas rates (cost reconciliations), the company will defer recognition of the variation in income and, as the case may be, establish a regulatory asset or liability for recovery from, or refund to, customers of the variation (86 percent of the variation, in the case of property tax differences due to assessment changes).
Earnings attributable to its gas business excluding any revenue reductions (O&R Adjusted Earnings) up to an 11 percent annual return on common equity (based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum 50 percent of capitalization) are retained by the company. O&R Adjusted Earnings above an 11 percent return are to be used to offset up to one-half of any regulatory asset to be recorded in that year resulting from the cost reconciliations (discussed in the preceding paragraph). One-half of any remaining O&R Adjusted Earnings between 11 and 12 percent return are retained by the company, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers. Thirty-five percent of any remaining O&R Adjusted Earnings between a 12 and 14 percent return are retained by the company, with the balance deferred for the benefit of customers. Any remaining O&R Adjusted Earnings above a 14 percent return are to be deferred for the benefit of customers. For purposes of these earnings sharing provisions, if in any rate year O&R Adjusted Earnings is less than 11 percent, the shortfall will be deducted from O&R Adjusted Earnings for the other rate years. The earnings sharing thresholds will each be reduced by 20 basis points if certain objectives relating to the companys retail choice program are not met. In 2007, O&R recorded a $1.3 million regulatory liability for earnings in excess of the 11 percent target return on equity for the rate year ended October31, 2007.
The rate plan also includes up to $1 million of potential revenue reductions in the first year of the agreement, increasing up to 89 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued $1.2 million, if the company does not comply with certain requirements regarding safety and customer service. In 2007, O&R recorded a $0.2 million regulatory liability for not complying with certain requirements regarding safety and customer service for the rate year ended October31, 2007.
Con Edison of New YorkSteam In September 2004, the PSC approved a steam rate plan covering the two-year period October 2004 through September 2006. The plan provided for increases in steam base rates of $49.6 million, effective October1, 2004, and $27.4 million, effective October1, 2005. The increases were net of a $6.2 million pre-tax charge to steam operating revenues, which the company recognized in 2004 to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization was to decrease steam revenues by $3 million over the period of the two-year rate plan.
Additional provisions of the steam rate plan included: equal sharing with customers of earnings in excess of an 11.75 percent return on common equity (earnings for the rate years ended September 2005 and 2006 were below this level); reconciliation of pension and other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the steam business to the amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of fuel and purchased steam and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.
In September 2006, the PSC approved the June 2006 settlement agreement among Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties. The settlement agreement establishes a rate plan that covers the two-year period October1, 2006 through September30, 2008. The rate plan provides for no changes in base rates or in the rate provisions pursuant to which the company recovers its fuel and purchased steam costs (the fuel adjustment clause), except for changes in the manner in which certain costs are recovered.
The rate plan provides that if the actual amount of pension or other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, property taxes or interference costs is greater than the respective amount for each such cost reflected in steam rates, the company will recognize a regulatory asset for the difference (90 percent of the difference, in the case of property taxes and interference costs) and defer recognition in expense of the difference. If the actual amount of such costs is less than the amount reflected in steam rates, the company will recognize a regulatory liability for the difference and decrease its revenues by the amount of such difference (90 percent of the difference, in the case of property taxes and interference costs).
Earnings attributable to the steam business, excluding the net revenue effect of steam sales related to colder-than-normal weather and certain other items, (Steam Adjusted Earnings) for a rate year up to 11 percent return on common equity (based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum of 50 percent of capitalization) are retained by the company. Steam Adjusted Earnings between 11 and 12 percent are to be used first to offset up to one-half of any regulatory asset recorded in the year resulting from the cost reconciliations (discussed in the preceding paragraph) for the rate year. The company then retains one-half of any remaining such Steam Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers. Any Steam Adjusted Earnings in excess of a 12 percent return on common equity are to be used first to offset any regulatory asset resulting from the cost reconciliations, with the company retaining one-quarter of any remaining Steam Adjusted Earnings and the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers. The earnings sharing thresholds would each be reduced by 20 basis points if certain requirements are not met. Earnings for the rate year ended September30, 2007 were below the 11 percent return on common equity.
The rate plan also includes up to approximately $4 million of potential revenue reductions if the company does not comply with certain requirements regarding steam business development and certain other matters. There were no revenue reductions recorded for the rate year ending September30, 2007.
In November 2007, the company filed with the PSC for an increase in steam base rates of $127 million, or 19 percent overall, effective October1, 2008. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11.5 percent and a common equity ratio of 48.4 percent. The filing also includes a proposal for a three-year rate plan, with additional increases of $22 million and $15 million effective October1, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The company also proposed to implement a steam revenue adjustment mechanism, new energy efficiency and demand reduction programs, and to continue business development programs.
In February 2008, the PSC initiated a proceeding to determine the prudence of the companys actions and practices relating to the July 2007 steam main rupture and, if the company was not prudent, whether and to what extent the expenses and capital expenditures the company has incurred, or in the future will incur, as result of the July 2007 steam main rupture should be borne by the companys ratepayers or whether additional remedies would be appropriate.

90 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Regulatory assets and liabilities at December31, 2007 and 2006 were comprised of the following items: Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Regulatory assets Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs $ 2,106 $ 1,929 $ 1,956 $ 1,776 Future federal income tax 1,112 995 1,057 941 Environmental remediation costs 378 318 312 255 Pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals 152 157 96 98 World Trade Center restoration costs 154 147 154 147 Net T&D reconciliation 142 94 142 94 Revenue taxes 77 68 75 67 O&R transition bond charges 63 67 - - Recoverable energy costs 50 55 50 55 Unbilled gas revenue 44 44 44 44 Workers compensation 41 42 41 42 Other retirement program costs 16 20 16 20 Electric rate increase accrual 14 44 14 44 Asbestos-related costs 10 10 10 10 Deferred derivative losses  long-term 5 18 4 15 Other 167 171 152 156 Regulatory assets 4,531 4,179 4,123 3,764 Deferred derivative losses  current 45 237 44 213 Recoverable energy costs  current 213 235 190 213 Total Regulatory Assets $ 4,789 $ 4,651 $ 4,357 $ 4,190 Regulatory liabilities Allowance for cost of removal less salvage $ 422 $ 492 $ 362 $ 432 Gain on sale of First Avenue properties 124 144 124 144 Prior year deferred tax amortization 51 81 51 81 NYS tax law changes 42 38 41 28 Interest on federal income tax refund 41 41 41 41 Property tax reconciliation 41 39 41 39 Transmission congestion contracts 40 96 40 96 Net electric deferrals 33 164 33 164 O&R refundable energy costs 29 40 - - Net steam deferrals 21 48 21 48 Deferred derivative gains  long-term 21 2 8 1 EPA SO 2 allowance proceeds  electric and steam 18 106 18 106 2004 electric, gas and steam one-time rate agreement charges 16 85 16 85 Gain on sale of W. 24 th St. property 10 46 10 46 DC service incentive 10 13 10 13 Gas interruptible sales credits 10 8 10 8 Gas excess earnings 10 - 10 - Other 158 214 140 192 Regulatory liabilities 1,097 1,657 976 1,524 Deferred derivative gains  current 10 6 5 5 Total Regulatory Liabilities $ 1,107 $ 1,663 $ 981 $ 1,529 91 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued During 2007 and 2006, in accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York offset $265 million and $141 million, respectively, of regulatory liabilities against an equal amount of regulatory assets.
For 2007, the regulatory liabilities settled related primarily to proceeds from the sale of SO 2 allowances, prior years transmission congestion contracts auction proceeds, gains from the sale of properties, revenue reductions related to customer outages, and the cost reconciliations for property taxes and interference costs.
The regulatory assets recovered related primarily to the Net T&D reconciliation and cost reconciliations for pension and other postretirement benefit costs.
For 2006, the regulatory liabilities settled related primarily to Adjusted Earnings in excess of an 11.4 percent return on equity, refunds received from the NYISO, and the cost reconciliations for property taxes and interference costs. The regulatory assets recovered related primarily to the Net T&D reconciliation and cost reconciliations for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and environmental remediation costs.
At December31, 2007 and 2006, net regulatory assets relating to the Net T&D reconciliation amounted to $142 million and $94 million, respectively. Consistent with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, the company expects to recover the regulatory assets related to the Net T&D reconciliation, in March 2008, by offsetting it against an equal amount of regulatory liabilities.
Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs represents the net regulatory asset associated with Con Edisons adoption of FASB Statement No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No.87, 88,106, and 132(R) (SFAS No.158) in December 2006. See Notes E and F.
World Trade Center restoration costs represents the non-capital costs (net of federal reimbursement and insurance recoveries) incurred by Con Edison of New York for emergency response to the September11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and for restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged in the attack. Non-capital costs include primarily the costs of moving facilities to avoid interfering with governmental projects (interference costs) and interest on capital and non-capital costs previously deferred. Con Edison of New York expects the PSC to permit recovery from customers of all costs relating to the World Trade Center attack (net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings). The companys current rate agreements provide for recovery from customers of $25.8 million annually of these World Trade Center restoration costs.
Revenue taxes represents the difference between taxes collected and the actual tax expense resulting from the repeal or reduction of certain revenue-based taxes and the imposition of a net income-based tax under the New York State tax law applicable to utilities that took effect in January 2000. For Con Edison of New York, effective October 2004, state income tax is being recovered through base rates for its gas and steam businesses and effective April 2005, for its electric business. For O&R, state income tax is being recovered through base rates for its electric and gas businesses effective November 2003. Base rates have been adjusted to reflect state income tax. An additional 1.53 percent income tax surcharge is used to fund mass transportation. For the Utilities, the surcharge is reconciled and differences between actual and billed amounts are charged or refunded to customers over a subsequent 12-month period.
Net electric deferrals represents the remaining unamortized balance of certain regulatory assets and liabilities of Con Edison of New York that were combined effective April1, 2005 and are being amortized to income over the period April 2005 through March 2008, in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks 2005 Electric Rate Agreement.
In May 2005, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of certain properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan. Net proceeds from the sale received at closing totaled $534 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $256 million. In accordance with the PSC order approving the sale of the properties, the company has deferred the net gain for the benefit of customers. The net after-tax gain on the sale, including additional expenses incurred in 2006, is $195 million. The net after-tax gain has been further reduced by $51 million to mitigate the steam revenue requirement in accordance with the current steam rate agreement. There may be additional proceeds in the event of certain zoning changes or other developments.
The $81 million prior year deferred tax amortization at December31, 2006 represents the revenue equivalent of $48 million for the amortization of deferred taxes in the years 2000 to 2004 that was not recorded during that period. The correction was recognized in 2005 with this balance deferred as a regulatory liability pending disposition by the PSC. In September 2007, the PSC granted Con Edison of New Yorks petition associated with this regulatory liability by directing the company to credit customers $51 million to reflect the impact on electric and steam rates of correcting the amortization of these deferred taxes. Accordingly, the company reduced this regulatory liability to $51 million. The impact of this accounting was a $17 million benefit to net income in 2007.
92 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Power Outage Proceedings During a July 2006 heat wave, electric service was interrupted to a number of Con Edison of New Yorks customers, predominantly in the companys Long Island City distribution network in Queens, New York. Also, a number of the companys customers in Westchester County, New York, experienced weather-related outages in 2006.
In April 2007, the PSC expanded its ongoing proceeding investigating the Queens outage to also consider the prudence of the companys conduct with respect to the outage. In February 2008, a PSC administrative law judge expanded the proceeding to also include an examination of whether the company was grossly negligent or acted in wanton disregard of the consequences with respect to the outage. The investigation has been reviewing the circumstances surrounding the outage, the companys response, communication and restoration efforts, the need for changes to the companys practices and procedures and the costs incurred by the company related to the outage. The PSC indicated that the prudence examination should consider and address, among other things: (i)the reasonableness of the companys response to the outage, its monitoring of its distribution system, its use of available information, its procedures for determining whether to shut down the Long Island City network (and the prudence of its decision not to do so) and its operation and maintenance of equipment in the Long Island City network; and (ii)whether and to what extent, the expenses and capital expenditures associated with the outage that the company has incurred, or may incur, should be borne by the companys customers. In February 2007, the PSC staff issued a report on the outage which, among other things, includes the PSC staffs (i)finding that the overriding cause of the outage was the companys failure to adequately operate, maintain and oversee the Long Island City network, (ii)conclusion that the company should have, but failed to, shut down the Long Island City network to minimize the impact of the outage to customers, and (iii)recommendation that the PSC initiate a proceeding to consider the prudence of the companys actions or inactions during the outage.
The PSC is also reviewing the Westchester outages, and has ordered the company to show cause why it should not be liable for certain food spoilage claims in connection with the September 2006 outage in Westchester resulting from Tropical Storm Ernesto.
The PSC engaged an independent third party consultant to audit the companys performance in response to outage emergencies and planning for restoration of service. In October 2007, the consultant issued its report which identified opportunities for improvement in emergency response, policy, organization, performance and communication. The consultant, among other things, recommended that (i)the company prepare a multi-year strategic plan focusing on system reliability, emergency preparedness, and major outage prevention and event restoration; (ii)the company restructure its emergency organizational function in accordance with the strategic plan; and (iii)a comprehensive study be done to determine if the company is providing adequate resources to support its infrastructure.
From July 2006 through December31, 2007, Con Edison of New York had paid $14 million, $5 million of which was reimbursed by insurers, to compensate customers for spoilage of food and other perishables resulting from the Queens outage, incurred estimated operating costs of $40 million, $1 million of which was reimbursed by insurers, invested $50 million in capital assets and retirements in the Long Island City network after the Queens outage, and reduced revenues under its 2005 Electric Rate Agreement by $18 million relating to customer outages. Twenty lawsuits have been filed against the company in connection with the Queens outage seeking generally unspecified compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages, for personal injury, property damage and business interruption.
The tariff provisions under which Con Edison of New York provides electric service limits the companys liability to pay for damages resulting from service interruptions to circumstances in which the company was grossly negligent and provides reimbursement to electric consumers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions in certain circumstances. In general, under the tariff provisions approved by the PSC in November 2007, the company is obligated to reimburse affected residential and commercial customers for food spoilage of up to $450 and $9,000, respectively and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. Reimbursement of such spoilage losses is limited to a maximum aggregate of $15 million for an outage. The company is not required to provide reimbursement for outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond its control, such as storms, provided the company makes reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as practicable.
The Companies believe that their financial statements appropriately reflect in all material respects the outage and related proceedings based upon available information but are unable to predict whether the outages and any related proceedings will have any further material adverse effect on their results of operations or have a material adverse effect on their financial position or liquidity.

In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New Yorks common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.
Long-term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2008-2012 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork 2008 $ 809 $ 280 2009 478 475 2010 684 625 2011 3 - 2012 304 300 The Utilities have issued $324 million of tax-exempt debt through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) that currently bear interest at a rate determined weekly and is subject to tender by bondholders for purchase by the Utilities.
Long-term debt is stated at cost, which in total, as of December31, 2007, approximates fair value (estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities), except for $225 million of Con Edison of New Yorks tax-exempt financing. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note O.
At December31, 2007 and 2006, long-term debt of Con Edison included $40 million and $42 million, respectively, of Transition Bonds issued by O&Rs New Jersey utility subsidiary through a special purpose entity (See Note B). At December31, 2007 and 2006, long-term debt of Con Edison included: $80 million (included in current and non-current liabilities held for sale) and 94 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued $98 million, respectively, of non-recourse debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a pledge of the Lakewood power plant, a related power purchase agreement and project assets; and $326 million (which was classified as long-term debt due within one year) and $330 million, respectively, of debt secured by the Newington power plant and related assets. See Note P. At December31, 2007 and 2006, restricted cash relating to the operations of the Lakewood plant was $13 million (included in current assets held for sale) and $16 million, respectively. See Note U.
Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison or Con Edison of New York, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below. The Companies believe that they were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at December31, 2007.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. The arrangements include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied might and, in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.
The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($100 million for Con Edison of New York).
Note D  Short-Term Borrowing In June 2006, Con Edison and the Utilities entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) under which banks are committed to provide loans and letters of credit, on a revolving credit basis. In June 2007, the Credit Agreement, which was to expire in June 2011, was extended for an additional year. Under the Credit Agreement, there is a maximum of $2.25 billion ($2.2 billion in the additional year) of credit available, with the full amount available to Con Edison of New York and $1 billion available to Con Edison. The Credit Agreement supports the Companies commercial paper programs. The Companies have not borrowed under the Credit Agreement.
At December31, 2007, Con Edison had $840 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $555 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks program. The weighted average interest rate was 5.5 percent and 5.6 percent for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively. At December31, 2006, Con Edison had $117 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4 percent, none of which was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks program.
The banks commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no event of default. The commitments are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change. Upon a change of control of, or upon an event of default by one of the Companies, the banks may terminate their commitments with respect to that company and declare any amounts owed by that company under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. Events of default include the exceeding at any time of a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital of 0.65 to 1 (at December31, 2007, this ratio was 0.50 to 1 for Con Edison and 0.49 to 1 for Con Edison of New York); having liens on its assets in an aggregate amount exceeding 5 percent of its consolidated total capital, subject to certain exceptions; and the failure by the company, following any applicable notice period, to meet certain other customary covenants. The fees charged for the revolving credit facilities and any loans made or letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reflect the Companies respective credit ratings. At December31, 2007 and 2006, $58.7 million and $15.8 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, respectively.
See Note R for information about short-term borrowing between related parties.
Note E  Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York and O&R and certain employees of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In addition, Con Edison maintains additional non-qualified supplemental pension plans. Investment 95 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period and other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period, subject to the deferral provisions discussed in the next paragraph. This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which provides a corridor method for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
In accordance with its current electric, gas and steam rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is deferring the difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the rate allowance. Generally, O&R has also been deferring such difference pursuant to its rate agreements. See Note B.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost The components of the Companies net periodic benefit costs for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Service cost  including administrative expenses $ 131 $ 133 $ 118 $ 122 $ 123 $ 108 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 491 460 430 459 430 402 Expected return on plan assets (646 ) (620 ) (642 ) (618 ) (595 ) (618 ) Amortization of net actuarial (gain)/loss 160 126 81 139 105 64 Amortization of prior service costs 11 13 13 9 11 12 Net periodic benefit cost $ 147 $ 112 $ - $ 111 $ 74 $ (32 ) Amortization of regulatory asset* 4 4 4 4 4 4 Total periodic benefit cost $ 151 $ 116 $ 4 $ 115 $ 78 $ (28 ) Cost capitalized (50 ) (34 ) 2 (41 ) (26 ) 9 Cost deferred (86 ) (108 ) (44 ) (87 ) (95 ) (33 ) Cost charged (credited) to operating expenses $ 15 $ (26 ) $ (38 ) $ (13 ) $ (43 ) $ (52 ) * Relates to increases in Con Edison of New Yorks pension obligations of $33 million from a 1993 special retirement program and $45 million from a 1999 special retirement program.

This Statement requires an employer to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For a pension plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation. For any other postretirement benefit plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The Statement required employers to recognize all unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax. Such amounts will be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost or income pursuant to the current recognition and amortization provisions. For the Utilities, generally regulatory accounting treatment is applied in accordance with SFAS No.71. Unrecognized prior service costs or credits and unrecognized gains and losses are recorded to regulatory assets or liabilities, rather than OCI.
Upon adoption of SFAS No.158, Con Edison recognized an additional pension liability of $85 million andeliminated the prepaid pension asset of $1.5 billion. A regulatory asset of $1.5 billionwas recordedfor theunrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with the Utilities consistent with SFAS No.71.An OCI charge of $8million(net of taxes) was recorded for theunrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with the competitive energy businesses and O&Rs New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries. Con Edison of New York recognized a pension asset of $13 million, eliminated a pension liability of $28 million and eliminated the prepaid pension asset of $1.5 billion. A regulatory asset of $1.4 billionwas recorded for the unrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs in accordance with SFAS No.71.A credit to OCI of $8million(net of taxes) was recorded which represents the reversal of OCI charges associated with the supplemental retirement plans partially offset by theunrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with former employees of the Utilities employed by the competitive energy businesses. In the first quarter of 2007, in accordance with SFAS No.158 and based on the final actuarial valuation as of December31, 2006, Con Edison adjusted the estimated amounts recorded upon adoption of SFAS No.158 by increasing its pension liability by $83 million and the related regulatory asset by $81 million and recognizing a charge of $1 million (net of taxes) to other comprehensive income (OCI).Con Edison of New York reversed the pension asset of $13 million it recorded upon adoption of SFAS No.158 and recorded a pension liability of $64 million and an additional regulatory asset of $77 million.
The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the pension plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI and the regulatory asset into net periodic benefit cost over the next year for Con Edison are $182 million and $8 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are $160 million and $7 million, respectively, for Con Edison of New York.
At December31, 2007 and 2006, Con Edisons investments include $71 million and $59 million, respectively, held in external trust accounts for benefit payments pursuant to the supplemental retirement plans. Included in these amounts for Con Edison of New York were $59 million and $47 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for the supplemental retirement plans for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $155 million and $122 million as of December31, 2007 and $138 million and $105 million as of December31, 2006, respectively.
Assumptions The actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31: Discount rate 6.00 % 6.00 % 5.70% Rate of compensation increase Con Edison of New York 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00% O&R 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00% Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31: Discount rate 6.00 % 5.70 % 5.90% Expected return on plan assets 8.50 % 8.50 % 8.80% Rate of compensation increase Con Edison of New York 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00% O&R 4.00 % 4.00 % 4.00% The expected return assumption reflects anticipated returns on the plans current and future assets. The Companies expected return was based on an evaluation of the current environment, market and economic outlook, relationships between the economy and asset class performance patterns, and recent and long-term trends in asset class performance. The projections were based on the plans target asset allocation and were adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to benchmark returns.
Discount Rate Assumption To determine the assumed discount rate, the Companies use a model that produces a yield curve based on yields on selected 97 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued highly rated (Aaa or Aa, by Moodys Investors Service) corporate bonds. Bonds with insufficient liquidity, bonds with questionable pricing information and bonds that are not representative of the overall market are excluded from consideration. For example, the bonds used in the model cannot be callable, they must have a price between 50 and 200, the yield must lie between 1 percent and 20 percent, and the amount of the issue must be in excess of $100 million. The spot rates defined by the yield curve and the plans projected benefit payments are used to develop a weighted average discount rate.
Expected Benefit Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years: (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013- 2017 Con Edison $ 439 $ 461 $ 485 $ 508 $ 532 $ 2,981 ConEdison of New York 409 430 453 474 496 2,784 Expected Contributions Based on estimates as of December31, 2007, the Companies are not required under funding regulations and laws to make any contributions to the pension plan during 2008. The Companies policy is to fund their accounting cost to the extent tax deductible, therefore, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York expect to make discretionary contributions of $131 million and $98 million, respectively, to the pension plan during 2008.
Plan Assets The asset allocations for the pension plan at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the target allocation for 2008 are as follows: Target Allocation PlanAssets atDecember31 Asset Category 2008 2007 2006 2005 Equity Securities 65 % 65 % 66 % 67% Debt Securities 27 % 28 % 28 % 28% Real Estate 8 % 7 % 6 % 5% Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100% Con Edison has established a pension trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.
Pursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edisons Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) has general oversight responsibility for Con Edisons pension and other employee benefit plans. The pension plans Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edisons chief executive, financial and accounting officers and others the Board of Trustees may appoint in addition to or in place of the designated Named Fiduciaries.
The investment objective for the pension trust is to maximize the long-term total return on the trust assets within a prudent level of risk. The investment strategy is to diversify its funds across asset classes, investment styles and fund managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2008 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2007.
Individual fund managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an ongoing basis, and reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a regular basis. Changes in fund managers and rebalancing of the portfolio are undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries approve such changes, which are also reported to the Committee.
The Companies also offer a defined contribution savings plan that covers substantially all employees and made contributions to the plan as follows: FortheYearsEnded December31 (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Con Edison $ 21 $ 20 $ 19 Con Edison of New York 19 18 17 Note F  Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities currently have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses.
Con Edison of New York also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. O&R has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees. Certain employees of Con 98 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Edisons competitive energy businesses are eligible to receive benefits under these programs.
Investment plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for the Companies and other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period, provided, however, that the Utilities generally defer any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and the current rate allowances for their electric, gas and steam operations.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost The components of the Companies net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Service cost $ 18 $ 17 $ 14 $ 14 $ 13 $ 10 Interest cost on accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation 93 87 84 82 77 74 Expected return on plan assets (81 ) (78 ) (79 ) (74 ) (72 ) (73 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 67 58 72 58 49 63 Amortization of prior service cost (14 ) (15 ) (15 ) (14 ) (15 ) (15 ) Amortization of transition obligation 4 4 4 4 4 4 Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost $ 87 $ 73 $ 80 $ 70 $ 56 $ 63 Cost capitalized (30 ) (23 ) (25 ) (25 ) (19 ) (21 ) Cost deferred (33 ) (33 ) (24 ) (30 ) (27 ) (18 ) Cost charged to operating expenses $ 24 $ 17 $ 31 $ 15 $ 10 $ 24 Funded Status The funded status of the programs at December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,566 $ 1,568 $ 1,315 $ 1,376 $ 1,383 $ 1,157 Service cost 18 17 14 14 13 10 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 93 87 84 82 77 74 Net actuarial loss/(gain) 29 (17 ) 244 40 (9 ) 221 Benefits paid and administrative expenses (125 ) (121 ) (108 ) (114 ) (110 ) (97 ) Participant contributions 19 20 19 19 19 18 Medicare prescription benefit 9 4 - 9 3 - Plan amendments 21 8 - 7 - - Benefit Obligation at End of Year $ 1,630 $ 1,566 $ 1,568 $ 1,433 $ 1,376 $ 1,383 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 1,005 $ 926 $ 882 $ 927 $ 861 $ 826 Actual return on plan assets 10 114 59 11 105 56 Employer contributions 76 65 71 64 52 58 Participant contributions 19 19 18 19 19 18 Benefits paid (122 ) (119 ) (104 ) (114 ) (110 ) (97 ) Fair Value of Plan Assets at End of Year $ 988 $ 1,005 $ 926 $ 907 $ 927 $ 861 Funded Status $ (642 ) $ (561 ) $ (642 ) $ (526 ) $ (449 ) $ (522 ) Unrecognized net loss 500 466 576 450 405 496 Unrecognized prior service costs (47 ) (81 ) (104 ) (68 ) (89 ) (103 ) Unrecognized net transition liability at January1, 1993* 18 22 26 18 22 26 Accrued Postretirement Benefit Cost $ - $ - $ (144 ) $ - $ - $ (103 ) * Being amortized over a period of 20 years and reduced by an additional amount in 2002 due to plan amendments.
99 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued For discussion of SFAS No.158 and the application of SFAS No.71 in recording unrecognized prior service costs or credits and unrecognized gains and losses, see Note E. Upon adoption of SFAS No.158, Con Edison recognized an additional liability for other postretirement benefits of $408 million. A regulatory asset of $390 millionwas recordedfor theunrecognized net losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition liability associated with the Utilities consistent with SFAS No.71.An OCI charge of $11million(net of taxes) was recorded for theunrecognized net losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition liability associated with the competitive energy businesses and O&Rs New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries. Con Edison of New York recognized an additional liability for other postretirement benefits of $338 million. A regulatory asset of $338 millionwas recordedfor theunrecognized net losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition liability in accordance with SFAS No.71.A charge to OCI of $1million(net of taxes) was recorded for theunrecognized net losses, unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition liability associated with operations that do not fall under SFAS No.71. In the first quarter of 2007, in accordance with SFAS No.158 and based on the final actuarial valuation as of December31, 2006, Con Edison adjusted the estimated amounts recorded upon adoption of SFAS No.158 by increasing its liability for other postretirement benefits by $27 million and the related regulatory asset by $29 million and recognizing a credit of $1 million (net of taxes) to OCI.Con Edison of New York recorded an additional liability for other postretirement benefits of $37 million and an additional regulatory asset of $37 million.
The estimated net loss, prior service costs and transition obligation for the other postretirement benefits that will be amortized from accumulated OCI and the regulatory asset into net periodic benefit cost over the next year for Con Edison are $67 million, $(12) million and $4 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are $58 million, $(14) million and $4 million, respectively, for Con Edison of New York.
Assumptions The actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31: Discount Rate 6.00 % 6.00 % 5.70% Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31: Discount Rate 6.00 % 5.70 % 5.90% Expected Return on Plan Assets Tax-Exempt 8.50 % 8.50 % 8.80% Taxable Con Edison of New York 7.50 % 7.50 % 7.80% O&R 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.30% Refer to Note E for descriptions of the basis for determining the expected return on assets, investment policies and strategies, and the assumed discount rate.
The health care cost trend rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December31, 2007 was 9 percent, which is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 percent by 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate used to determine benefit obligations as at December31, 2007 was 8 percent, which is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 percent by 2012 and remain at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects at December31, 2007: Con Edison Con Edison of New York 1-Percentage-Point (Millions of Dollars) Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Effect on accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation $ 17 $ (2 ) $ (2 ) $ 15 Effect on service cost and interest cost components for 2007 1 (1 ) (1 ) 1 Expected Benefit Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years: (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013- 2017 Gross Benefit Payments Con Edison $ 112 $ 117 $ 123 $ 128 $ 131 $ 686 Con Edison of New York 100 105 109 113 116 607 Medicare prescription benefit receipts Con Edison $ 10 $ 11 $ 12 $ 13 $ 14 $ 84 Con Edison of New York 9 10 11 12 12 75 Expected Contributions Based on estimates as of December31, 2007, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York expect to make contributions of $75 million and $61 million, respectively, to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2008.
100 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Plan Assets The asset allocations for Con Edison of New Yorks other postretirement benefit plans at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the target allocation for 2008 are as follows: Target Allocation Plan Assets atDecember31 Asset Category 2008 2007 2006 2005 Equity Securities 65 % 65 % 65 % 66 % Debt Securities 35 % 35 % 35 % 34 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Con Edison has established postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.
Refer to Note E for a discussion of Con Edisons investment policy for its benefit plans.
Effect of Medicare Prescription Benefit The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 created a benefit for certain employers who provide postretirement drug programs. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-2, issued by the FASB in May 2004, provides accounting and disclosure requirements relating to the Act. The Companies actuaries have determined that each of their prescription drug plans provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20 years; therefore, the Companies are eligible to receive the benefit that the Act makes available. When the plans benefits are no longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan, 25 percent of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the Companies prescription programs.
Note G  Environmental Matters Superfund Sites Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs (which include costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment, and monitoring) and environmental damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas plant sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated, are referred to herein as Superfund Sites.
For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate in 2007 dollars of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas plant sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate in 2007 dollars of the companys share of undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards, and experience with similar sites.
The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Accrued Liabilities: Manufactured gas plant sites $ 267 $ 228 $ 212 $ 180 Other Superfund Sites 60 64 59 63 Total $ 327 $ 292 $ 271 $ 243 Regulatory assets $ 378 $ 318 $ 312 $ 255 Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. As investigations progress on these and other sites, the Utilities expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. Under their current rate agreements, the Utilities are permitted to recover or defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) certain site investigation and remediation costs.
Environmental remediation costs incurred and insurance recoveries received related to Superfund Sites at December31, 2007 and 2006, were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Remediation costs incurred $ 50 $ 53 $ 42 $ 45 Insurance recoveries received* 1 3 1 3 * Reduced amount deferred for recovery from customers 101 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued In 2006, Con Edison of New York estimated that for its manufactured gas plant sites, its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range up to $1.1 billion. In 2007, O&R estimated that for its manufactured gas plant sites, each of which has been investigated, the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range up to $115 million. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at the sites that have not yet been investigated and additional assumptions about these and the other sites regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different.
Asbestos Proceedings Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. In 2006, Con Edison of New York estimated that its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional suits that may be brought over the next 15 years is $10 million. The estimate was based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different. In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Under its current rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is permitted to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) costs incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers compensation claims. The accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for the Companies at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Accrued liability  asbestos suits $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 Regulatory assets  asbestos suits $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 Accrued liability  workers compensation $ 116 $ 117 $ 111 $ 112 Regulatory assets  workers compensation $ 41 $ 42 $ 41 $ 42 Note HOther Material Contingencies Manhattan Steam Main Rupture In July 2007, a Con Edison of New York steam main located in midtown Manhattan ruptured. It has been reported that one person died and others were injured as a result of the incident. Several buildings in the area were damaged. Debris from the incident included dirt and mud containing asbestos. The response to the incident required the closing of several buildings and streets for various periods. As of December31, 2007, with respect to the incident, the company incurred estimated operating costs of $23 million for property damage, clean up and other response costs, recorded $10 million in actual and expected insurance recoveries and invested $17 million in capital, retirement and other costs. Over 30 plaintiffs have sued the company seeking generally unspecified compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages, for personal injury, property damage and business interruption. The company has notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies currently in force will cover most of the companys costs, which the company is unable to estimate, but which could be substantial, to satisfy its liability to others in connection with the incident.

Northeast Utilities Litigation Con Edison and Northeast Utilities are pursuing claims against each other for damages as a result of the alleged breach of their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January11, 2000. The litigation, entitled Consolidated Edison, Inc. v. Northeast Utilities, was commenced in March 2001 and is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties are seeking to recover from each other fees and expenses each incurred in connection with the merger agreement and preparing for the merger. In addition, Con Edison is seeking to recover from Northeast Utilities compensation for synergies that were lost when the merger did not occur, together with the attorneys fees it has incurred in connection with the litigation. In January 2008, the court denied Northeast Utilities motion to dismiss Con Edisons claim for lost synergies. The Company expects a trial in this case to begin in 2008. Con Edison does not expect that the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Other Contingencies See Power Outage Proceedings in Note B and Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J.
Guarantees Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison 102 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Development subsidiary has issued a guarantee on behalf of an entity in which it has an equity interest. Maximum amounts guaranteed by Con Edison totaled $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
A summary, by type and term, of Con Edisons total guarantees at December31, 2007 is as follows: Guarantee Type (Millions of Dollars) 03 years 410 years >10 years Total Commoditytransactions $ 879 $ 30 $ 205 $ 1,114 Affordablehousingprogram - 17 - 17 Intra-company guarantees 25 - 1 26 Other guarantees 226 40 - 266 Total $ 1,130 $ 87 $ 206 $ 1,423 Commodity Transactions Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its competitive energy businesses in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a 42 MW foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet.
Affordable Housing Program Con Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries for debt relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No.94-01, Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects, neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet.
Intra-company Guarantees Con Edison guarantees electricity sales made by Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to O&R and Con Edison of New York.
Other Guarantees Con Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following:  $41 million relates to guarantees issued by Con Edison covering RCN Corporations lease payment to use Con Edison of New Yorks conduit system in accordance with a tariff approved by the PSC and rent payment obligations under various lease agreements for office buildings (see Note T). RCN Corporation is obligated to reimburse Con Edison for any payments made under these guarantees. In the case of the guarantee to Con Edison of New York, this obligation is partially secured by a letter of credit of $19 million, and, in the case of the lease guarantees, this reimbursement is fully secured by letters of credit;  $25 million for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solutions indemnity agreement for surety bonds;  $18 million for guarantees and standby financial letters of credit in connection with investments in energy infrastructure, power and cogeneration projects;  $182 million relates to guarantees issued by Con Edison covering certain representations and obligations of Con Edison Development and its subsidiary in connection with their December 2007 agreements to sell substantially all of their ownership interests in their generating projects to North American Energy Alliance, LLC. See Note U. The company is unable to estimate the maximum limit of loss under these guarantees.
103 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Note I  Non-Utility Generators and Other Power Purchase Agreements Con Edison of New York has long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with non-utility generators (NUGs) and others for generating capacity. The company recovers its purchase power costs in accordance with provisions approved by the PSC. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A.

In accordance with SFAS No.13, these leases are classified as either capital leases, operating leases or leveraged leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.
Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered from customers. The following assets under capital leases are included in the Companies consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2007 and 2006: Con Edison Con Edison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Utility Plant Transmission $ 6 $ 12 $ 6 $ 7 Common 22 23 20 23 Total $ 28 $ 35 $ 26 $ 30 The accumulated amortization of the capital leases for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York was $45 million and $44 million, respectively, at December31, 2007, and $41 million and $40 million, respectively, at December31, 2006.

The transactions respectively involve gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, with a total investment of $259 million. The transactions were financed with $93 million of equity and $166 million of non-recourse, long-term debt secured by the underlying assets. In accordance with SFAS No.13, Con Edison is accounting for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. At December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, the companys investment in these leveraged leases was $9 million and $24 million, respectively, comprised of a $235million gross investment less $226 million of deferred tax liabilities in 2007 and a $232 million gross investment less $208 million of deferred tax liabilities in 2006.
On audit of Con Edisons tax return for 1997, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed the tax losses in connection with the 1997 LILO transaction.In December 2005, Con Edison paid a $0.3 million income tax deficiency asserted by the IRS for the tax year 1997 with respect to the 1997 LILO transaction. In April 2006, the company paid interest of $0.2 million associated with the deficiency and commenced an action in the United States Court of Federal Claims, entitled Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. v. United States, to obtain a refund of this tax payment and interest. A trial was completed in November 2007 and the parties are in the process of filing post trial briefs. A decision is expected later this year.
In connection with its audit of Con Edisons federal income tax returns for the tax years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2006, the IRS disallowed $195 million of net tax deductions taken with respect to both of the LILO transactions for the tax years. For the tax years 1998 through 2001, Con Edison filed appeals of these audit level disallowances with the Appeals Office of the IRS, where consideration of this matter is pending. Con Edison is preparing a similar appeal with respect to the tax year 2006. In connection with its audit of Con Edisons federal income tax returns for the tax years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the IRS indicated that it intends to disallow $180 million of net tax deductions taken with respect to both of the LILO transactions for the tax years. If and when these audit level disallowances become appealable, Con Edison intends to file appeals of the disallowances with the Appeals Office of the IRS.
Con Edison believes that its LILO transactions have been correctly reported, and has not recorded any reserve with respect to the disallowance of tax losses, or related interest, in connection with its LILO transactions. Con Edisons estimated tax savings, reflected in its financial statements, from the two LILO transactions through December31, 2007, in the aggregate, was $171 million. If Con Edison were required to repay all or a portion of these amounts, it would also be required to pay interest of up to $63 million at December31, 2007.
In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction, which became effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. This FSP requires the expected timing of income tax cash flows generated by Con Edisons LILO transactions to be reviewed at least annually. If the expected timing of the cash flows is revised, the rate of return and the allocation of income would be recalculated from the inception of the LILO transactions, and the company would be required to recalculate the accounting effect of the LILO transactions, which 105 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued would result in a charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations.
Note K  Goodwill and Intangible Assets In 2007 and 2006, Con Edison completed impairment tests for its goodwill of $406 million related to the O&R merger, and determined that it was not impaired. For the impairment test, $245 million and $161 million of the goodwill were allocated to Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively.
Con Edisons intangible assets consist of the following: December31, 2007 December31, 2006 (MillionsofDollars) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Con Edison Development Power purchase agreement $ - $ - $ - $ 112 $ 33 $ 79 Other 3 1 2 2 1 1 Total $ 3 $ 1 $ 2 $ 114 $ 34 $ 80 As a result of the pending sale of Con Edison Development assets, the intangible asset related to the power purchase agreement has been reclassified to Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale. In addition, the related amortization expense of $9 million for the year ended December31, 2007, and $10 million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 was reclassified to Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations (Net of Income Taxes) in the accompanying Con Edison consolidated statements of income. Amortization ceased at the time that the Con Edison Development assets were reclassified as held for sale. See Note U.
Future amortization expense from the remaining intangible assets will be immaterial.
Note L  Income Tax The components of income tax are as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Charge/(benefit) to operations: State Current $ 30 $ 4 $ 66 $ 20 $ - $ 65 Deferred  net 72 86 9 70 78 1 Federal Current 72 73 394 46 55 385 Deferred  net 284 250 (95 ) 262 228 (115 ) Amortization of investment tax credits (6 ) (6 ) (7 ) (6 ) (6 ) (7 ) Total Charge to Operations 452 407 367 392 355 329 Charge/(benefit) to other income: State Current 8 (8 ) (7 ) - (6 ) - Deferred  net (8 ) 1 1 - 5 2 Federal Current (9 ) (13 ) (23 ) 5 (12 ) (8 ) Deferred  net (6 ) 2 10 (5 ) 7 7 Total Charge/(Benefit) to Other Income (15 ) (18 ) (19 ) - (6 ) 1 Total $ 437 $ 389 $ 348 $ 392 $ 349 $ 330 106 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The tax effect of temporary differences, which gave rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, is as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation $ 2,075 $ 2,029 $ 1,873 $ 1,841 Regulatory liability  future income tax 1,240 1,118 1,165 1,048 Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs  SFAS No.158 855 788 794 726 State income tax 474 454 394 380 Capitalized overheads 432 475 399 442 Other 544 439 378 272 Total deferred tax liabilities 5,620 5,303 5,003 4,709 Deferred tax assets: Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs  SFAS No.158 855 788 794 726 Regulatory asset  future income tax 125 123 109 107 State income tax 47 55 18 34 Other 207 327 139 241 Total deferred tax assets 1,234 1,293 1,060 1,108 Net Liabilities 4,386 4,010 3,943 3,601 Investment Tax Credits 79 85 75 81 Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits $ 4,465 $ 4,095 $ 4,018 $ 3,682 Deferred Income Taxes  Recoverable Energy Costs 86 96 77 87 Total Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits $ 4,551 $ 4,191 $ 4,095 $ 3,769 In April 2007, the New York state statutory income tax rate decreased from 7.5% to 7.1%, retroactive to January1, 2007. The rate decrease resulted in a reduction of $20 million and $19 million to the net accumulated deferred tax liabilities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively, of which $19 million and $18 million were deferred for customers benefit for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York, respectively.
Reconciliation of the difference between income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the prevailing statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows: Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork (% of Pre-tax income) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Statutory Tax Rate Federal 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % Changes in computed taxes resulting from: State income tax 5 5 4 4 5 4 Depreciation related differences 1 1 2 1 1 2 Cost of removal (6 ) (6 ) (6 ) (6 ) (6 ) (6 ) Other (3 ) (1 ) (4 ) (3 ) (2 ) (3 ) Effective Tax Rate 32 % 34 % 31 % 31 % 33 % 32 % Uncertain Tax Positions In January 2007, the Companies adopted FIN 48. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Statement No.109. Under the interpretation, an enterprise is not allowed to recognize, in its financial statements, the benefit of a tax position unless that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position.
107 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The IRS has essentially completed its field audits of the Companies federal income tax returns through 2006. The Companies federal income tax returns for 2002 through 2006 reflect certain tax positions with which the IRS does not or may not agree, including tax positions with respect to the deduction of certain construction-related costs for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. The field audits of the Companies New York state income tax returns have been completed through 2002. Any adjustments to federal income tax returns will result in the Companies filing the federal audit changes with New York state to incorporate in the applicable state income tax returns.
The Companies uncertain tax positions include the simplified service cost method (SSCM) used to determine the extent to which construction-related costs could be deducted in 2002 through 2005. The Companies expect that they will be required to repay, with interest, a portion of their past SSCM tax benefits ($316 million, of which $288 million is attributable to Con Edison of New York) and to capitalize and depreciate over a period of years costs they previously deducted under SSCM. Interest on all past SSCM tax benefits for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York would be approximately $103 million and $94 million, respectively. Repayment of the SSCM tax benefits would not otherwise affect the Companies results of operations because deferred taxes have been previously provided for the related temporary differences between the SSCM deductions taken for federal income tax purposes and the corresponding amounts charged to expense for financial reporting purposes.
In June 2007, Con Edison paid $160 million to the Internal Revenue Service, $147 million of which is attributable to Con Edison of New York, as a deposit for the repayment, including related interest, that the Companies expect will be required with respect to the past SSCM benefits. As a result, for federal income tax purposes, interest will continue to accrue only on the portion of the liability, if any, that exceeds the deposit. Con Edison and Con Edison of New York have recorded the deposit as a noncurrent asset on their consolidated balance sheet.
Upon adoption of FIN 48, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York reclassified previously recorded tax liabilities of $151 million and $139 million, respectively, which primarily related to SSCM, to a liability for uncertain tax positions. At December31, 2007, the liabilities for uncertain tax positions for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $155 million and $142 million, respectively, and accrued interest on the liabilities amounted to $35 million and $31 million, respectively. The Companies recognize interest accrued related to the liability for uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties, if any, in operating expenses in the Companies consolidated income statements. In 2007, Con Edison recognized interest expense for uncertain tax positions of $11 million, of which $9 million is attributable to Con Edison of New York.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison ConEdisonof NewYork Balance at January1, 2007 $ 151 $ 139 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year - - Additions based on tax positions of prior years 19 17 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (15 ) (14 ) Balance at December31, 2007 $ 155 $ 142 The Companies do not expect the total amounts of uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.
Note M  Stock-Based Compensation The Companies may compensate employees and directors with, among other things, stock options, restricted stock units and contributions to a discount stock purchase plan. The Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) provided for awards of stock options to officers and employees for up to 10million shares of Con Edison common stock. The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) among other things, provides for awards of restricted stock units, stock options and, to Con Edisons non-officer directors, deferred stock units for up to 10million shares of common stock (of which not more than four million shares may be restricted stock or stock units).
Shares of Con Edison common stock used to satisfy the Companies obligations with respect to stock-based compensation may be new (authorized, but unissued) shares, treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market. The shares used during the period ended December31, 2007 have been new shares.
108 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued In January 2006, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.123(R), Share-Based Payment, applying the modified prospective approach. Pursuant to SFAS No.123(R), the Companies have recognized the cost of stock-based compensation as an expense using a fair value measurement method. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Companies in the period ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Stock options $ 1 $ 7 $ - $ 1 $ 6 $ - Restricted stock units 2 1 5 1 1 4 Performance-based restricted stock 5 11 4 4 10 3 Non-officer director deferred stock compensation 1 1 1 1 1 1 Total $ 9 $ 20 $ 10 $ 7 $ 18 $ 8 If the Companies had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  An Amendment of FASB Statement No.123, for the purposes of recognizing expense for stock-based compensation arrangements, the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for the period ended December31, 2005: ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts/Shares in Millions) 2005 2005 Net income, as reported $ 719 $ 705 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 6 5 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of related tax effects 10 8 Pro forma net income $ 715 $ 702 Earnings per common share: Basic  as reported $ 2.95 Basic  pro forma $ 2.93 Diluted  as reported $ 2.94 Diluted  pro forma $ 2.92 Stock Options Stock options generally vest over a three-year period and have a term of ten years. Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a common share when the option was granted. The Companies generally recognize compensation expense (based on the fair value of stock option awards) over the continuous service period in which the options vest. Awards to employees currently eligible for retirement are expensed in the month awarded.
The outstanding options are equity awards because shares of Con Edison common stock are delivered upon exercise of the options. As equity awards, the fair value of the options is measured at the grant date. There were no options granted in 2007. The weighted-average fair values of options granted in 2006 and 2005 are $3.81 and $4.51 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2006 2005 Risk-free interest rate 4.62% 3.95% Expected life 4.6years 4.6years Expected stock volatility 13.41% 19.00% Expected dividend yield 5.06% 5.37% The weighted average risk-free rate is calculated using the five-year U.S. Treasury securities rate on the grant date of each stock option and then weighted for the number of shares awarded. The expected life of the options is based on historical employee exercise behavior and post-vesting cancellations. The expected stock volatility is calculated using the quarterly closing prices of Con Edison stock over a period of five years, which approximates the expected term of the options. The expected dividend yield is calculated using the annualized dividend divided by the stock price on the date of grant.
109 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued A summary of changes in the status of stock options awarded as of December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at 12/31/04 7,808,184 $ 41.302 6,759,251 $ 41.381 Granted 1,300,950 42.723 1,037,750 42.713 Exercised (1,149,533 ) 38.529 (1,023,650 ) 38.457 Forfeited (92,450 ) 43.943 (75,950 ) 44.668 Outstanding at 12/31/05 7,867,151 41.913 6,697,401 42.000 Granted 1,663,900 45.133 1,410,700 45.175 Exercised (854,550 ) 39.584 (729,700 ) 39.805 Forfeited (58,900 ) 44.283 (31,800 ) 45.006 Outstanding at 12/31/06 8,617,601 42.773 7,346,601 42.842 Exercised (1,971,450 ) 41.770 (1,793,500 ) 41.780 Forfeited (49,301 ) 42.865 (21,251 ) 42.899 Outstanding at 12/31/07 6,596,850 $ 43.072 5,531,850 $ 43.187 The change in the fair value of all outstanding options from their grant dates to December31, 2007 and 2006 (aggregate intrinsic value) for Con Edison were $38 million and $46 million, respectively. The change in the fair value of all outstanding options from their grant dates to December31, 2007 and 2006 (aggregate intrinsic value) for Con Edison of New York was $31 million and $38 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in 2007 and 2006 was $16 million and $7 million, respectively, and the cash received by Con Edison for payment of the exercise price was $82 million and $34 million, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding is four years as of December31, 2007.
The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at December31, 2007 for each plan year for the Companies: Con Edison Con Edison of New York Plan Year Remaining Contractual Life Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable 2006 9 1,635,800 $ 45.161 1,399,700 $ 45.188 2005 8 1,252,000 42.745 1,020,750 42.722 2004 7 929,900 43.768 929,900 742,350 43.763 742,350 2003 6 798,100 39.939 798,100 627,900 39.964 627,900 2002 5 853,050 42.510 853,050 715,550 42.510 715,550 2001 4 368,800 37.750 368,800 320,800 37.750 320,800 2000 3 130,150 32.500 130,150 94,650 32.500 94,650 1999 2 555,000 47.938 555,000 537,600 47.938 537,600 1998 1 74,050 42.563 74,050 72,550 42.563 72,550 Total 6,596,850 $ 43.072 3,709,050 5,531,850 $ 43.187 3,111,400 110 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The exercise prices of options awarded in 2006 and 2005 range from $43.50 to $46.88 and $42.18 to $43.72, respectively. The total expense to be recognized in future periods for unvested stock options outstanding as of December31, 2007 is $1 million for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York.
Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit awards under the LTIP have been made as follows: (i)to officers and certain employees, including awards that provide for adjustment of the number of units (performance-restricted stock units or Performance RSUs); and (ii)in connection with the directors deferred compensation plan. Each restricted stock unit awarded represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, or, except for units awarded under the directors plan, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof.
In accordance with SFAS No.123(R), for outstanding restricted stock awards other than Performance RSUs or awards under the directors deferred compensation plan, the Companies have accrued a liability based on the market value of a common share on the grant date and are recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period. The weighted average vesting period for outstanding awards is three years and is based on the employees continuous service to Con Edison. Prior to vesting, the awards are subject to forfeiture in whole or in part under certain circumstances. The awards are liability awards because each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. As such, prior to vesting, changes in the fair value of the units are reflected in net income. At December31, 2007 and 2006, there were 114,505 and 92,500 units outstanding, respectively, for Con Edison, of which 62,505 and 41,700 units outstanding, respectively, for Con Edison of New York. The weighted average fair value as of the grant date of the outstanding units other than Performance RSUs or awards under the directors deferred compensation plan for December31, 2007 and 2006 was $42.834 and $40.877 per unit, respectively, for Con Edison. The weighted average fair value as of the grant date of the outstanding units for December31, 2007 and 2006 was $45.838 and $43.233 per unit, respectively, for Con Edison of New York. At December31, 2006, 130,000 vested restricted stock units were distributed to a retired officer. The total expense to be recognized by the Companies in future periods for unvested awards outstanding as of December31, 2007 for Con Edison and Con Edison of NewYork was $1 million.
The number of units in each annual Performance RSU award is subject to adjustment as follows: (i)50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on Con Edisons total shareholder return relative to a specified peer group during a specified performance period (the TSR portion); and (ii)50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 132 percent based on determinations made in connection with Con Edison of New Yorks Executive Incentive Plan, or, for certain officers, the O&R Annual Team Incentive Plan or goals relating to Con Edisons competitive energy businesses (the EIP portion). Units generally vest when the performance period ends.
For the TSR portion of Performance RSU, the Companies use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the awards. The fair value is recomputed each reporting period as of the earlier of the reporting date and the vesting date. For the EIP portion of Performance RSU, the fair value of the awards is determined using the market price as of the earlier of the reporting date or the vesting date. Performance RSU awards are liability awards because each Performance RSU represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. As such, changes in the fair value of the Performance RSUs are reflected in net income. The following table illustrates the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards: 2007 Risk-free interest rate 2.91%-4.00% Expected term 3 years Expected volatility 13.92% Expected quarterly dividends $0.58-$0.595 The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the date of grant. The expected term of the Performance RSUs is three years, which equals the vesting period. The Companies do not expect significant forfeitures to occur. The expected volatility is calculated using daily closing stock prices over a period of three years, which approximates the expected term of the awards. Expected annual escalation of dividends is based on historical trends.
A summary of changes in the status of the Performance RSUs TSR portion during the period ended December31, 2007 is as follows: Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork Units Weighted Average FairValue* Units Weighted Average FairValue* Non-vested at 12/31/06 126,425 $ 13.992 94,025 $ 14.420 Granted 146,880 45.601 108,833 45.776 Vested and Exercised (46,762 ) 39.311 (32,607 ) 38.988 Forfeited (30,563 ) - (24,218 ) - Non-vested at 12/31/07 195,980 $ 33.398 146,033 $ 33.048 * Fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation described above.

Con Edison has a deferred stock compensation plan for non-officer directors. Awards under the deferred compensation stock plan are covered by the LTIP. Each director receives 1,500 stock units annually for service as a director. These stock units are deferred until the directors termination of service. Directors may elect to receive dividend equivalents earned on stock units in cash payments. Restricted stock units issued under the directors deferred compensation plan are considered equity awards, because they may only be settled in shares. Directors immediately vest in units issued to them. The fair value of the units is determined using the closing price of Con Edisons common stock on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue. In the period ended December31, 2007, approximately 22,386 units were issued.
Stock Purchase Plan The Stock Purchase Plan provides for the Companies to contribute $1 for each $9 invested by their directors, officers or employees to purchase Con Edison common stock under the plan. Eligible participants may invest up to $25,000 during any calendar year (subject to an additional limitation for officers and employees of not more than 20% of their pay). Dividends paid on shares held under the plan are reinvested in additional shares unless otherwise directed by the participant.
Participants in the plan immediately vest in shares purchased by them under the plan. The fair value of the shares of Con Edison common stock purchased under the plan was calculated using the average of the high and low composite sale prices at which shares were traded at the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding such purchase dates. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, 633,647, 624,751 and 590,413 shares were purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted average price of $47.70, $45.33 and $45.05 per share, respectively.
Note N  Financial Information by Business Segment The business segments of each of the Companies were determined based on managements reporting and decision-making requirements in accordance with SFAS No.131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive businesses. See Note U. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities.
All revenues of these business segments, excluding revenues earned by Con Edison Development on certain energy infrastructure projects, which are deemed to be immaterial, are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments, excluding certain investments in energy infrastructure projects by Con Edison Development ($245 million at December31, 2007), are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A.
Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.

113 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Note O  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No.133). Under SFAS No.133, derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard. Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value under SFAS No.133.
Energy Price Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas, and steam by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, options, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. The fair values of these hedges at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Fair value of net assets $ (90 ) $ (319 ) $ (69 ) $ (206 ) Generally, the collateral requirements associated with, and settlement of, derivative transactions are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies consolidated statement of cash flows.
Credit Exposure The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements, collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps.
Con Edison and Con Edison of New York had $158 million and $39 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2007, respectively. Con Edisons net credit exposure consisted of $99 million with investment-grade counterparties (a portion of which is insured through credit insurance and hedged with credit default swaps), and $59 million primarily with commodity exchange brokers. Con Edison of New Yorks net credit exposure was primarily with commodity exchange brokers.
Cash Flow Hedges Con Edisons subsidiaries, primarily the competitive energy businesses prior to July1, 2007, designated a portion of derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133. Under cash flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be effective, the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in OCI and reclassified to earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective is recognized in earnings in the period in which such determination is made.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses elected to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for their commodity derivatives effective July1, 2007. As of such date, net unrealized derivative losses relative to cash flow hedges, reported in OCI, amounted to $28 million, which are being reclassified to earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. At December31, 2007, there are no net unrealized derivative gains associated with the discontinued cash flow hedges remaining in accumulated OCI.
Economic Hedges The Companies enter into certain derivative instruments that do not qualify or are not designated as hedges under SFAS No.133. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses record unrealized gains and losses on these derivative contracts in earnings in the reporting period in which they occur. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, Con Edison recorded in non-utility operating revenues unrealized pre-tax losses of $8 million and $26 million, respectively.
Interest Rate Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The fair values of these interest rate swaps at December31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Fair value of interest rate swaps $ (11 ) $ (15 ) $ - $ (3 ) Fair Value Hedges Con Edison of New Yorks swap (related to its $225 million of Series 2001A tax-exempt debt) was designated as a fair value hedge. The counterparty terminated the swap on January2, 2008.
114 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Cash Flow Hedges Con Edison Developments and O&Rs swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges are as follows: Debt Maturity Date Notional Amount (Millionsof Dollars) Fixed Rate Paid Variable Rate Received O&R Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bond, 1994 Series A 2014 $ 55 6.09% Current bond rate Con Edison Development Amortizing variable rate loans  Lakewood 2008 $ 44 6.68% LIBOR Con Edison Developments swap was reclassified at December31, 2007 to Current Liabilities Held for Sale as a result of the pending sale of Con Edison Development generating assets. See Note U.
In late 2004 and early 2005, Con Edison of New York entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest payments associated with the anticipated issuance of $300 million of its debentures later in 2005. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of each hedge, the company locked in a swap rate that had a high correlation with the companys total borrowing costs. The swap agreements were settled in 2005 at the issuance of the debentures. A net loss of $4 million with respect to the swap agreements was recorded in OCI in 2005, which will be reclassified to interest expense over the term of the related debentures.
The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in the accumulated OCI at December31, 2007: AccumulatedOther Comprehensive Income/(Loss)NetofTax PortionExpectedtobe ReclassifiedtoEarnings duringtheNext12Months (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison ConEdison of New York Con Edison Con Edison of NewYork Interest Rate Swaps $ (9 ) $ (2 ) $ (1 ) $ - The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in interest rates. For the Utilities, these costs are generally recovered in rates and the reclassification will have no material impact on results of operations.
Note P  Variable Interest Entities FASB Interpretation No.46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R) addresses the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both.
Con Edison enters into arrangements including leases, partnerships and PPAs, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, Con Edison retains or may retain a variable interest in these entities.
VIE assets include non-utility plant of $315 million and $323 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to a lease arrangement entered into by a Con Edison Development subsidiary in 2000, to finance the construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire (the facility). These VIE assets were reclassified at December31, 2007 to Non-utility property held for sale as a result of the pending sale of the assets. Debt related to the facility was $326 million and $330 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such debt was reclassified to long term debt due within one year at December31, 2007 as a result of the pending sale. At the expiration of the initial lease term in June 2010, the subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the facility for the then outstanding amounts expended by the lessor for the facility. See Note U.
If the VIE assets are not sold and in the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the facility in June 2010, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value for an amount not to exceed $240 million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the lessor if an event of default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the lessors investment in the facility plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value guarantee. The subsidiarys payment and performance obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison.
Con Edison has a variable interest in a non-consolidated VIE related to Con Edison Developments sole limited interest in an 115 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued affordable housing partnership that began in 2000. Con Edison Developments maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE is $5 million at December31, 2007 and 2006. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the debt undertaken by the partnership. See Note H.
Con Edison of New York did not apply FIN 46R to the following five potential VIEs with which it has long-term PPAs: Sithe/Independence Partners, LP, East Coast Power, LLC, Selkirk Cogen Partners, LP, Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, LP, and Indeck Energy Services of Corinth, Inc. In each quarter of 2007, requests were made of the counterparties for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether Con Edison of New York is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. See Note I for information on these PPAs.
Note Q  Asset Retirement Obligations Con Edison and Con Edison of New York account for retirement obligations on their assets in accordance with SFAS No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No.143). This accounting standard requires recognition of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. When the liability is initially recorded, asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
The Utilities include in depreciation the estimated removal costs, less salvage, for utility plant assets. In accordance with SFAS No.143, future removal costs that do not represent legal asset retirement obligations are recorded as regulatory liabilities pursuant to SFAS No.71. The related regulatory liabilities recorded for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $422 million and $362 million at December31, 2007 and $492 million and $432 million at December31, 2006, respectively.
The Companies identified future asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in their buildings and equipment within the generating stations and substations, and within the steam and gas distribution systems. The Companies also identified asset retirement obligations relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place. The estimates of future liabilities were developed using historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors. The obligation for the cost of asbestos removal from the Companies generating stations and substation structures was not accrued since the retirement dates cannot be reasonably estimated.
At December31, 2007, the liabilities of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York for the fair value of their legal asset retirement obligations were $110 million, as compared with $97 million and $96 million, respectively, at December31, 2006. In addition, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for asset retirement costs at December31, 2007 by $34 million, as compared with $19 million and $18 million, respectively, at December31, 2006. Pursuant to SFAS No.71, Con Edison of New York also recorded a reduction of $76 million and $78 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to the regulatory liability associated with cost of removal to reflect accumulated depreciation and interest accretion costs.
Note R  Related Party Transactions The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive businesses provide administrative and other services to each other pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the PSC. The costs of administrative and other services provided by Con Edison of New York to, and received by it from, Con Edison and its other subsidiaries for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ConEdisonofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2007 2006 2005 Cost of services provided $ 64 $ 64 $ 64 Cost of services received $ 45 $ 47 $ 48 In addition, Con Edison of New York and O&R have joint gas supply arrangements, in connection with which Con Edison of New York sold to O&R $161 million, $149 million and $185 million of natural gas for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These amounts are net of the effect of related hedging transactions.
Con Edison of New York entered into financial contracts on behalf of O&R with various brokers and counterparties to hedge purchases of electricity. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, the realized gains or losses recorded as part of purchase power expense is $5 million, $9 million, and $(3) million, respectively.
As a result of an auction held in October 2005, Con Edison of New York entered into financial contracts with Con Edison Energy to hedge purchases of electricity in 2006. Con Edison of New Yorks realized losses associated with these contracts in 2006 totaled $62 million. These losses were recovered under Con Edison of New Yorks recoverable energy cost rate provision. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A. Con Edison Energys gain on this transaction was offset by a corresponding loss on a hedge position.
In December 2005, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to O&R, for periods of not more than 12 116 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued months, in amounts not to exceed $200 million outstanding at any time, at prevailing market rates. In December 2007, Con Edison of New York loaned O&R $55 million, which was repaid in January 2008.
Note S  New Financial Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No.51 (SFAS No.160), which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. This Statement requires ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. The adoption of SFAS No.160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No.141R, Business Combinations (SFAS No.141R), which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. This Statement requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. The adoption of SFAS No.141R is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In November 2007, the FASB issued FSP No. SFAS 142-f, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. The guidance in this FSP would amend the factors used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The guidance in this FSP becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. The Companies are currently evaluating the impact of this FSP on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In June 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No.07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to be used in Future Research and Development Activities. The EITF concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. If an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense. The guidance in this EITF becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. The Companies do not expect this EITF to have a material effect on their financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In June 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in Issue No.06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. The EITF concluded that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified as nonvested equity shares, nonvested equity share units, and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The amount recognized in additional paid-in capital for the realized income tax benefit from dividends on those awards should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards. The adoption of EITF No.06-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No.48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The guidance in this FSP clarifies how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The guidance in this FSP became effective upon adoption of the FASB Interpretation No.48, which the Companies adopted in January 2007. See Note L. The application of this FSP did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP No.39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No.39. This FSP permits a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset provided that the receivable or payable arises from the same master netting arrangement with the same counterparty as the derivative instruments. The guidance in this FSP becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The adoption of this FSP is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  including an Amendment of FASB Statement No.115. This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The guidance in this Statement becomes effective for fiscal periods beginning 117 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued after November15, 2007. The Companies have not elected the fair value option.
In September 2006, the FASB issued EITF Issue 06-4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. This EITF requires employers to record a liability for future benefits for endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements that provide a postretirement benefit to an employee. The guidance in this EITF becomes effective for fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2007. The Companies do not expect this EITF to have a material impact on their financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No.157). This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements. It applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements and, accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. The guidance in this Statement becomes effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Companies have evaluated the impact of this Statement on their financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Upon adoption of this Statement, SFAS No.157 provides for limited retrospective application for day one gains and losses previously deferred under EITF 02-03, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. To the extent that an entity has deferred day one gains and losses on their commodity contracts due to the inability to recognize them under EITF 02-03, it should record an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of those derivative instruments on that day. Con Edison Energy has deferred day one gains under EITF 02-03. The adoption of SFAS No.157 is expected to result in Con Edison Energy recording a transition adjustment for its day one gains in the amount of $17 million, net of taxes, to beginning retained earnings for 2008. The application of SFAS No.157 will not impact the financial statements of other CEI subsidiaries. It will, however, require additional disclosures for items that are measured at fair value.
Note T  Con Edison Communications (CEC) In March 2006, Con Edison completed the sale of CEC to RCN Corporation for approximately $39 million in cash. The sale resulted in a loss from discontinued operations of approximately $1 million for the period ended December31, 2006.
Subsequent to the sale, Con Edison of New York will receive lease payments from RCN Corporation for the right to use its electric conduit system in accordance with the tariff approved by the PSC. The continuing cash flows related to the lease payments are not considered significant in relation to the revenues expected to be generated by the CEC business.
In accordance with SFAS No.144, the loss on the sale of CEC is reported as Discontinued operations on Con Edisons consolidated income statement.
Note U  Con Edison Development In December 2007, Con Edison Development and its subsidiary, CED/SCS Newington, LLC, agreed to sell their ownership interests in power generating projects (Rock Springs, Ocean Peaking Power, CEEMI, Newington and Lakewood) with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,706 megawatts to North American Energy Alliance, LLC for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments. The sale is subject to review or approval by various federal, state and local regulators. The sale is scheduled to be completed in two stages during the first half of 2008. Con Edison estimates that the cash proceeds from the sale, net of repayment of project debt, taxes and transaction expenses would be approximately $654 million and that the sale would result in an after-tax gain, net of transaction expenses, of approximately $335 million. Con Edison is considering alternatives with respect to the repayment of the project debt that might result in higher cash proceeds in 2008 and an increased net after-tax gain.
In February 2008, Allco Finance Group Limited, which through subsidiaries, is one of the owners of the North American Energy Alliance, LLC requested that the Australian Securities Exchange suspend trading in the shares of Allco Finance Group Limited. Con Edison is unable to predict whether the completion of the sale may be adversely affected by developments related to Allco Finance Group Limited.
118 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued In accordance with SFAS No.144, in 2007, the assets and liabilities of the generating projects were classified as held for sale on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet. Effective November15, 2007, Con Edison ceased recording depreciation and amortization expense on these assets. Had the company continued to record depreciation and amortization, an additional charge of $5 million would have been recognized during 2007. In accordance with EITF Issue No.87-24, Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations, which permits, but does not require the allocation of other consolidated interest to discontinued operations, Con Edison has chosen not to allocate interest associated with corporate level debt to discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities presented separately under the captions held for sale in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007, consist of the following: (Millions of Dollars) 2007 Non-utility property $ 929 Accumulated depreciation (151 ) Non-utility property held for sale $ 778 Cash $ 9 Restricted cash 5 Accounts receivable 5 Inventory 16 Other current assets 5 Current assets held for sale $ 40 Intangible assets $ 70 Other noncurrent assets 18 Noncurrent assets held for sale 88 Current portion of long-term debt $ 20 Accounts payable 3 Other current liabilities 5 Current liabilities held for sale $ 28 Long term debt $ 60 Other noncurrent liabilities 1 Noncurrent liabilities held for sale $ 61 Con Edison currently expects that one of its competitive energy businesses will provide energy management services, such as plant scheduling and fuel procurement, for the Rock Springs, Ocean Peaking Power and CEEMI projects. Such services are expected to give rise to a significant level of continuing direct cash flows between Con Edison and the disposed projects, and to provide Con Edison with significant continuing involvement with the operations of the disposed projects. As a result, under the guidance of EITF Issue No.03-13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No.144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations (EITF No.03-13), Con Edison has concluded that the Rock Springs, Ocean Peaking Power and CEEMI projects do not qualify for discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of operations of these projects have been reported within continuing operations in the accompanying Con Edison consolidated statements of income.
Con Edison also expects that one of its competitive energy businesses will engage in certain services for the Newington and Lakewood projects after the sale. However, such services are expected to be much more limited than those provided to the Rock Springs, Ocean Peaking Power and CEEMI projects, and are not expected to give rise to significant level of continuing direct cash flows between Con Edison and the disposed projects, or to provide Con Edison with significant continuing involvement in the operating or financial policies of the disposed projects. As a result, Con Edison believes that the criteria within SFAS No.144 and EITF No.03-13 for discontinued operations treatment have been met for the Newington and Lakewood projects. Accordingly, the results of operations of these projects has been reflected in Income/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations (Net of Income Taxes) in the accompanying Con Edison consolidated statements of income . The Newington and Lakewood projects had revenues of $268 million, $194 million and $298 million and pre-tax profit (loss) of $5 million, $-, and $(20) million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
