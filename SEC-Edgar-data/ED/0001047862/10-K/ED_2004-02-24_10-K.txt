CON EDISON Corporate Overview Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R). Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are referred to in this report as the "Utilities" and, together with Con Edison, the "Companies." Con Edison has no significant business operations other than those of the Utilities and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries. See "Corporate Overview" in Item 7.
Operating Segments Con Edison's principal business segments are Con Edison of New York's regulated electric, gas and steam utility segments, O&R's regulated electric and gas utility segments and the unregulated businesses of Con Edison's other subsidiaries. In 2003, the operating revenues of the Utilities were 90percent of Con Edison's operating revenues. For a discussion of operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see "Results of Operations" in Item 7. For additional segment information see NoteO to the financial statements in Item 8 and the discussions of Utilities below in this Item 1.
Regulation The Utilities are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including by state utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Con Edison, itself, is not subject to such regulation except to the extent that the rules or orders of these agencies impose restrictions on relationships between Con Edison and the Utilities. See "Regulation" in the discussion below of Con Edison of New York's business in this Item 1.
Con Edison is a "holding company" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Con Edison is exempt from all provisions of PUHCA, except Section9(a)(2) (which requires SEC approval for a direct or indirect acquisition of five percent or more of the voting 7 securities of any other electric or gas utility company) on the basis that Con Edison and the Utilities are organized and carry on their utility businesses substantially in the State of New York and that it does not derive any material part of its income from a public utility company organized outside of the State of New York. This exemption is available even though Con Edison subsidiaries that are neither an "electric utility company" nor a "gas utility company," as defined, under PUHCA engage in interstate activities.
Con Edison has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by legislative and regulatory developments. The Utilities are subject to extensive regulation in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to Con Edison's subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Companies. See "Regulatory Matters" in Item 7.
Competition See "Competition," below in the discussion of the businesses of the Utilities in this Item 1 and "Unregulated Subsidiaries," below.
Unregulated Subsidiaries Con Edison has four unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity, gas and energy-related services to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R; Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities. The unregulated subsidiaries accounted for almost 10percent of consolidated operating revenues and a reduction in consolidated net income of 18percent in 2003, and 7percent of consolidated total assets at December31, 2003. For a discussion of the unregulated subsidiaries' operating revenues and operating income, see "Results of OperationsUnregulated Subsidiaries and Other" in Item 7.
Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edison's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources, Capital Requirements and Financial Market Risks" in Item 7. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
State Anti-takeover Law New York State law provides that a "domestic corporation," such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five 8 years after the acquisition of voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation's board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent "fair price" formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.
Employees Con Edison has no employees other than those of Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries (which at December31, 2003 had 12,648, 1,028 and 403 employees, respectively).
The respective collective bargaining agreements covering about two-thirds of each of the Utilities' employees expire in June2004.
CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Corporate Overview Con Edison of New York, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Con Edison of New York provides electric service in all of New York City (except part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than eight million. It also provides gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens and Westchester, and steam service in parts of Manhattan.
Operating Segments Con Edison of New York's principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses. In 2003, electric, gas and steam operating revenues were 78percent, 16percent and 6percent, respectively, of its operating revenues. For a discussion of the company's operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see "Results of Operations" in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see NoteO to the financial statements in Item 8.
Electric Operations Electric Sales.
Electric operating revenues were $6billion in 2003 or 78percent of Con Edison of New York's operating revenues. The percentages were 80 and 78percent, respectively, in the two preceding years. In 2003, 57percent of the electricity delivered by Con Edison of New York in its service areas was sold by the company to its full-service customers, 24percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions, an unregulated subsidiary of Con Edison, to the company's customers under its electric retail access program and the balance was delivered to the state and municipal customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and the economic development customers of municipal electric agencies. The company charges for the delivery of electricity sold by itself and other suppliers to customers in its service area.
For additional information about electricity sales, see "Operating Statistics," below, and "Results of OperationElectric" in Item 7.
9 Electric Peak Load.
The electric peak load in Con Edison of New York's service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The 2003 service area peak load, which occurred on June26, was 11,875thousand kilowatts (MW). The 2003 peak load included an estimated 7,220 MW for Con Edison of New York's full-service customers, 2,725 MW for customers participating in its electric retail access program and 1,930 MW for NYPA's customers and municipal electric agency customers. If adjusted to historical design weather conditions, the 2003 peak load would have been 12,600 MW. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2004 service area peak load will be 12,825 MW, including an estimated 7,800 MW for its full-service customers, 2,930 for its electric retail access customers and 2,095 MW for NYPA's customers and municipal electric agency customers. "Design weather" for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak load is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes.
Electric Supply.
Most of the electricity sold by Con Edison of New York to its customers in 2003 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The firm power contracts were primarily with non-utility generators (NUGs).
The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers with electric energy purchased under contracts with NUGs or others, generated from its electric generating facilities or purchased through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.
For additional information about electric power purchases, see "Regulatory Matters" and "Electric Power Requirements" in Item 7 and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements in Item8.
For information about the company's contracts with NUGs for approximately 3,200 MW of electric generating capacity, see NoteI to the financial statements in Item 8.
For information about the company's 630 MW of electric generating facilities, see Item 2.
The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of Con Edison of New York, as an integrated system and administers a wholesale market for electricity in New York State. Pursuant to criteria that are reviewed annually, the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (either owned or contracted for) in an amount that is at least 18percent above the expected peak load for their customers. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough New York City-located capacity to cover 80percent of their New York City customer peak loads. Con Edison of New York met the requirements applicable to it in 2003 and expects to meet them in 2004.
Gas Operations Gas Sales.
Gas operating revenues in 2003 were $1billion or 16percent of Con Edison of New York's operating revenues. The percentages were 15percent in each of the two preceding years. In 2003, 51percent of the gas delivered by the company in its service area was sold by the 10 company to its full-service (firm and interruptible) customers and 49percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions. For additional information about gas sales, see "Operating Statistics," below, and "Results of OperationsGas" in Item 7.
Gas Requirements.
Firm demand for gas in Con Edison of New York's service area peaks during the winter heating season. The "design criteria" for the company's gas system assume severe weather conditions, which have not occurred since the 1933-34 winter. Under these criteria, the company estimated that its requirements to deliver gas to firm customers during the November2003/March2004 winter heating season would amount to 78,900thousand dekatherms (mdths) (including 67,600 mdths to its firm sales customers and 11,300 mdths to its firm transportation customers). Through January31, 2004, the company's peak throughput day in this heating season occurred on January26, 2004 when it delivered 1,068 mdths of gas (including 750 mdths to its firm sales customers, 17 mdths to NYPA, 190 mdths to its transportation customers and 111 mdths for use by the company in generating electricity and steam).
Under its design criteria, the company projects that for the November2004/March2005 winter heating season, its requirements for firm gas customers will amount to 79,500 mdths (including 67,800 mdths to firm sales customers and 11,700 mdths to firm transportation customers) and that the peak day requirements for these customers will amount to 978 mdths. The company expects to be able to meet these requirements.
Gas Supply.
Con Edison of New York and O&R have established a combined gas supply and capacity portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, Con Edison of New York (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). See NoteU to the financial statements in Item 8.
Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2008. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation and storage services. Charges under these contracts are approved by the FERC. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2013. The Utilities are required to pay certain charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $129million in 2003. See "Contractual Obligations" in Item 7. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and have interruptible gas transportation contracts. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements in Item 8.
Steam Operations Steam Sales.
Con Edison of New York sells steam in Manhattan south of 96th Street, mostly to large office buildings, apartment houses and hospitals. In 2003, steam operating revenues were $537million or 6percent of the company's operating revenues. The percentages were 6percent in the two preceding years.
11 For additional information about Con Edison of New York's steam operations, see "Regulatory MattersSteam" and "Results of OperationsSteam" in Item 7, the discussion of Con Edison of New York's steam facilities in Item 2 and "Operating Statistics," below.
Steam Peak Load and Capacity.
Demand for steam in Con Edison of New York's service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak load during the winter of 2003/2004 (through January31, 2004) occurred on January16, 2004 when the load reached 10.1million pounds (mlbs) per hour. The company's estimate for the winter of 2004/2005 peak demand of its steam customers is 10.5 mlbs per hour under design criteria, which assume severe weather.
On December31, 2003, the steam system had the capability of delivering about 12.6 mlbs of steam per hour. Con Edison of New York estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver 12.8 mlbs of steam per hour in the 2004/2005 winter.
Steam Supply.
52percent of the steam sold by Con Edison of New York in 2003 was produced in the company's steam-only generating stations; 36percent was produced in the company's steam/electric generating stations, where it is first used to generate electricity; and 12percent was purchased from others. See Item 2 for a discussion of Con Edison of New York's steam facilities.
Regulation The PSC regulates, among other things, Con Edison of New York's electric, gas and steam rates, the siting of its transmission lines and the issuance of its securities. Certain activities of the company are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. In addition, various matters relating to the construction and operations of the company's facilities are subject to regulation by other governmental agencies. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company. For additional information, including information about the company's electric, gas and steam rates, see "Regulatory Matters" in Item 7.
The PSC from time to time conducts "generic" proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include those relating to utilities exiting the business of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities' provider of last resort responsibility and consumer protections); the State's goal of increasing to 25percent (from approximately 18percent at the end of 2003) the portion of electricity used in the State provided from renewable energy resources; and addressing any rate disincentives against the promotion of energy efficiency and distributed generation. The company typically is an active participant in such proceedings. The company does not expect that the pending proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
Competition Con Edison of New York is primarily a "wires and pipes" energy delivery company that:  has sold most of its electric generating capacity; 12  provides its customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas from other suppliers;  purchases most of the electricity and all of the gas supplies it sells to its full-service customers (the cost of which is recovered pursuant to provisions approved by the PSC); and  provides energy delivery services to customers pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.
See "Rates and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteB and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements in Item8.
The company's electric, gas and steam rates are among the highest in the country.
Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for Con Edison of New York delivery customers. The company does not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain PSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements and install facilities to provide the service. The new company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the PSC.
Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edison of New York's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources, Capital Requirements and Financial and Commodity Market Risks" in Item 7.
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenals (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of Con Edison of New York and its predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored. See "Asbestos" and "Superfund" in the discussion of Con Edison of New York's legal proceedings in Item 3 and NoteG to the financial statements in Item 8.
Con Edison of New York's capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $87million in 2003 and are estimated to be $76million in 2004.
In April2000, Con Edison of New York entered into a Stipulation and Order of Consent with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in connection with its response to the release of PCB's during the September1998 transformer fire at the Arthur Kill Generating 13 Station site that it sold in 1999. Among other things, the company agreed to maintain an effective environmental compliance program.
Toxic Substances Control Act.
Virtually all electric utilities, including Con Edison of New York, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.
Water Quality.
Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of Con Edison of New York's service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
The potential for adverse effects from global warming associated with the atmospheric release of greenhouse gases (GHG), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), from industrial sources may result in legislation or regulations requiring utilities to reduce GHG emissions from power plants and take other steps to offset GHG emissions from other sources. Con Edison of New York minimizes GHG emissions from its generating plants through the use of oil and gas fuels and the application of cogeneration technologies that reduce GHG emissions per unit of energy output. The company's GHG emissions also include sulfur hexafluoride (used for arc suppression at substations) and methane (from operation of its gas delivery system), which the company is working voluntarily with EPA to reduce. The cost to comply with any new legislation or regulations limiting the company's GHG emissions could be substantial.

16 O&R General Nature and Scope of Business O& R, a subsidiary of Con Edison incorporated in New York State in 1926, has two wholly-owned utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO), a New Jersey corporation, and Pike County Light& Power Company (Pike), a Pennsylvania corporation.
O&R and its utility subsidiaries provide electric service in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania, an approximately 1,350 square mile service area. They also provide gas service in southeastern New York and Pennsylvania. O&R's business is subject to regulation by the PSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) and the FERC. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to O&R could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
O&R's principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility businesses. In 2003, electric and gas operating revenues were 73percent and 27percent, respectively, of its operating revenues.
Competition O&R is primarily a "wires and pipes" energy delivery company that:  has sold its electric generating capacity;  provides its customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas from other suppliers;  purchases the electricity and gas it supplies to its full-service customers (the cost of which is recovered pursuant to provisions approved by the PSC, NJBPU or PPUC); and  provides energy delivery services to customers pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.
See "Rates and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteB and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements in Item 8.
Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for O&R delivery customers. The company does not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain the consent of the applicable state utility commission, satisfy applicable local requirements and install facilities to provide the service. The new company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the applicable state utility commission.
For additional information about O&R's business, see the discussion of O&R's results of operations in Item 7 and the notes to the financial statements in Item 8. For information about O&R's legal proceedings, see Item3.

22 ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CON EDISON Northeast Utilities For information about legal proceedings relating to Con Edison's October1999 agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities, see NoteQ to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Newington Project For a description of the Newington Project, see NoteT to the financial statements included in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). In September2002, Duke/Fluor Daniel, the general contractor for the Newington Project, initiated an arbitration proceeding with respect to its contract claims for an additional payment to it of approximately $100million for alleged project costs and a 176-day extension of the project's scheduled substantial completion date. In September2002, the general contractor commenced an action in Superior Court in the State of New Hampshire, and obtained a pre-judgment attachment on the project as security for the payment of its claim for additional project costs. The New Hampshire Superior Court subsequently ruled that the attachment was impermissible and ordered it to be removed. This ruling has been stayed pending an appeal before the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Nuclear Generation In February2004, the PSC approved the December2003 settlement among Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties regarding the PSC proceeding investigating a February2000 to January2001 outage of the nuclear generating unit the company sold in 2001, its causes and the prudence of Con Edison of New York's actions regarding the operation and maintenance of the generating unit. The proceeding covered, among other things, Con Edison of New York's inspection practices, the circumstances surrounding prior outages, the basis for the company's decisions concerning replacement of the unit's steam generators and whether, and to what extent, increased replacement power costs and repair and replacement costs should be borne by Con Edison's shareholders. Pursuant to the settlement, the company will refund $45.5million to its customers and provide $2.5million to fund one or more energy efficiency programs for its low-income customers. In 2000, the company accrued a $40million liability for possible refund to customers in connection with this proceeding. In addition, under the settlement, the company will forego recovery of $89.5million of replacement power costs that the company had incurred in 2000 but not billed to customers and as to which no customer account receivable or regulatory asset was established and no income previously recognized. The settlement reduced 2003 net income by $8million ($5million after tax).
Asbestos For information about legal proceedings relating to exposure to asbestos, see NoteG to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
23 Plaintiff has agreed with Con Edison of New York to settle for $350,000 the action in New York State Supreme Court, New York County, entitled Robert Croteau v. A.C.& S.,Inc. et al. In March2003, the jury in this action awarded plaintiff $47million for asbestos-related injuries. The plaintiff was employed by a subcontractor who did work in the 1970s on two power plants being constructed for Con Edison of New York.
Superfund The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites at which Con Edison of New York has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies' former manufactured gas sites, its Astoria PCB storage facility, the Arthur Kill Generating Station site that it sold in 1999 and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the company under Superfund, including with respect to its manufactured gas sites, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see NoteG to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
Con Edison of New York and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for manufactured gas at sites in New York City and Westchester County, New York (MGP Sites). Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than Con Edison of New York and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is requiring the company to investigate and, if necessary to protect public health and the environment from any MGP-related contamination that may be present at them, and to develop and implement remediation programs for the MGP Sites, which include 33 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites.
The information available to Con Edison of New York for most of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods, if any, to be used. Investigation at most of the MGP Sites has not yet started and has been completed at only two of the MGP Sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 12 MGP Sites, including sites in Manhattan and other parts of New York City and in Westchester County.
Astoria Site.
Con Edison of New York is permitted by the DEC to operate a PCB storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Apart from the PCB storage facility, portions of the property were the former location of an MGP and have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its DEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found, and where necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The company has investigated various sections of the property, but has not yet begun investigating 24 the former MGP area. The company has submitted to the DEC and the New York State Department of Health a report identifying the known areas of PCB contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of the known PCB contamination on the property will be at least $19million.
Arthur Kill Transformer Site.
Following a September1998 transformer fire at Con Edison of New York's former Arthur Kill Generating Station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of PCBs was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed DEC-approved cleanup programs for the station's facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July1999 DEC consent order, the company completed a DEC-approved Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Program to assess the nature and extent of the contamination in, and to recommend a proposed remediation program for, the waterfront area of the station. DEC has selected the remediation program for the waterfront area and the company will implement it pursuant to an additional consent order expected to be entered into during 2004. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of PCB contamination at the site will be at least $3.5million. See "Con Edison of New YorkEnvironmental Matters" in Item1.
Other Superfund Sites.
Con Edison of New York is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites has been, and is expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.
The following table lists each of Con Edison of New York's other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in table under "Start"), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending, and the company's current estimate of its potential liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring and environmental damages at the site or the unpaid share of any payments it is required to make under a settlement agreement resolving its liability for the site.

25 Washington Heights Power Outage Lawsuits relating to a July1999 interruption of electric service to customers served by Con Edison of New York's Washington Heights distribution network were brought in New York State Supreme and Civil Courts, New York County. A number of cases, including purported class action lawsuits, have been dismissed, discontinued or settled for de minimis amounts. At December31, 2003, 14 cases relating to the outage were pending, including suits by the New York City Transit Authority seeking $20million and by Columbia University and New York and Presbyterian Hospital seeking $23million. The company does not expect that the remaining cases will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

O&R Asbestos For information about legal proceedings relating to exposure to asbestos, see NoteG to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Superfund The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the company under Superfund, including with respect to its manufactured gas sites, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see NoteG to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Four of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, three of which have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The DEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites.
O&R has investigated and detected soil and/or groundwater contamination to varying degrees at all of the O&R MGP Sites. In November2002, O&R initiated an Interim Remedial Measure at one MGP site that is currently 80% complete. In addition, the DEC has developed a proposed remedial action plan for another O&R MGP site that will be distributed for comment in 2004. Additional investigation and determination of the remediation and monitoring methods will be required at the other O&R MGP Sites.
West Nyack Site.
In 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with the DEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking 26 underground storage tank was found as well. O&R has completed all remediation at the site that the DEC has required to date. The DEC is expected to determine whether any additional groundwater remediation will be required.
Other Superfund Sites.
O&R is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites has been, and is expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

(Con Edison), Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are subsidiaries of Con Edison and are referred to in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) as the "Utilities." The Utilities, together with Con Edison, are referred to in this MD&A as the "Companies." Neither Con Edison of New York nor O&R makes any representation as to information in this report relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.
Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.
CORPORATE OVERVIEW Con Edison's principal business operations are those of the Utilities. Con Edison also has unregulated subsidiaries that compete in energy-related and telecommunications industries.
Certain financial data of Con Edison's subsidiaries is presented below: Twelve months ended December 31, 2003 At December 31, 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Net Income Assets Con Edison of New York $ 8,166 83 % $ 591 112 % $ 17,764 85 % O&R 727 7 % 45 9 % 1,269 6 % Total Utilities 8,893 90 % 636 121 % 19,033 91 % Con Edison Communications 19 - % (108 )(b) (20 )% 35 (b) - % Con Edison Development 303 3 % (9 )(b) (2 )% 1,275 (b) 6 % Con Edison Energy 54 1 % 1 - % 117 - % Con Edison Solutions 578 6 % 19 3 % 127 1 % Other(a) (20 ) - % (11 ) (2 )% 379 2 % Total Con Edison $ 9,827 100 % $ 528 100 % $ 20,966 100 % (a) Represents inter-company and parent company accounting.
(b) Reflects impairment charges discussed below.
Con Edison's net income for common stock in 2003 was $528million or $2.39 a share. Net income for common stock in 2002 and 2001 was $646million or $3.03 a share and $682million or $3.22 a share, 32 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED respectively. Included in 2003 net income for common stock were impairment charges for certain unregulated telecommunications and generating assets ($94million after-tax or $0.43 per share) and the impact of a regulatory settlement ($5million after-tax charge or $0.03 per share), partially offset by the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles ($3million after-tax gain or $0.02 per share). Included in the 2002 results was the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles ($22million after-tax charges or $0.11 per share).
For additional segment financial information, see NoteO to the financial statements and "Results of Operations," below.
The Companies are each subject to certain material contingencies, including certain Utility environmental matters and Con Edison's legal proceedings relating to its October1999 agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities. See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Contingencies," below.
Regulated Utility Subsidiaries Con Edison of New York provides electric service to over 3.1million customers and gas service to 1.1million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.
The Utilities are primarily "wires and pipes" energy delivery companies that are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Pursuant to restructuring agreements, the Utilities have sold most of their electric generating capacity and provide their customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas directly from other suppliers through the Utilities' retail access programs. The Utilities supply more than half of the energy delivered by them in their service areas and provide delivery service to their customers that buy energy from other suppliers. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they supply to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers, pursuant to approved rate plans.
Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities' earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities' ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital.
Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors. The Utilities have experienced increased customer demand in recent years. In June, July and August of 2002, both Con 33 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Edison of New York and O&R set new three-month electric delivery records of more than 17million and 1.7million megawatt hours, respectively. In June2003, Con Edison of New York and O&R each experienced a new record electric peak load for that month. The June peak was an all-time peak electric load for O&R. In January2004, Con Edison of New York and O&R each experienced a new winter electricity peak load.
Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities' capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak load adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak loads. On this basis, Con Edison of New York's weather-adjusted peak load in the summer of 2003 was 12,600 MW, 1.6 percent higher than the adjusted peak load in 2002. The forecast annual growth in the electric peak load over the next five years is 1.6 percent. The company anticipates an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this load growth with the exceptionally high level of reliability that it currently provides (see "Capital Requirements," below).
The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New York has an electric rate agreement (approved in November2000) that ends March2005 and gas and steam rate agreements (approved in April2002 and November2000, respectively) that end in September2004. These agreements do not reflect all of the increased construction expenditures and related costs incurred and expected to be incurred to meet increasing customer demand and reliability needs that have been experienced since the date of those agreements (see "Capital Requirements," below). The company filed petitions in November2003 to increase rates for gas and steam service effective October2004 and expects to filea petition in April2004 to increase rates for electric service effective April2005. O&R has rate agreements for its electric and gas services in New York that extend through October2006. The rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity. Changes in energy sales and delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather-normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses). Rates charged to customers, pursuant to these agreements, may not be changed during the respective terms of these agreements other than for recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. See "Regulatory Matters" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements.
Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies," below.
The respective collective bargaining agreements covering about two-thirds of each of the Utilities' employees expire in June2004.
34 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Unregulated Businesses Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive businesses and are subject to different risks than the Utilities. In view of conditions affecting certain of its competitive activities, the company recognized impairment charges of $159million ($94million after-tax) for its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses in the fourth quarter of 2003. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies," below and NoteH to the financial statements. At December31, 2003, Con Edison's investment in its unregulated subsidiaries was $703million and the unregulated subsidiaries' assets amounted to $1.6billion, including $339million related to Con Edison Development's Newington project. See NoteT to the financial statements.
Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity and gas to delivery customers of Con Edison of New York, O&R and other utilities and also offers energy related services. As of December31, 2003, the company served approximately 30,000 electric customers with an estimated aggregate peak load of 1,400 MW.
Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects. At December31, 2003, the company owned interests of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 244 MW are sold under long-term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity markets.
Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy) provides energy and capacity to Con Edison Solutions and others and markets the output of plants owned or operated by Con Edison Development. The company also provides risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development and offers these services to others.
Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The company's properties (the capitalized cost of which at December31, 2003 amounted to $30million, net of the impairment charge discussed above and in NoteH to the financial statements) include network facilities and nearly 400 miles of fiber optic cable that has been installed in the New York City metropolitan area primarily through Con Edison of New York's underground conduits and other rights of way. Con Edison is evaluating strategic alternatives for its telecommunications business.
Con Edison anticipates investing $59million in its unregulated businesses over the next two years and will focus on maximizing the value of their existing assets. See "Capital Requirements" and "Capital Resources," below.

37 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companies' financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies' critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases.
The critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public UtilitiesSFAS No.71 The Utilities are subject to SFAS No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, are subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
The Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in NoteB to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends and appropriate discount rates. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2003, 2002 and 2001.
38 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Primarily because of the amortization of previous years' net investment gains, Con Edison of New York's pension expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period (20percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No.87.
The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods. Con Edison's current estimate for 2004 is a reduction, compared with 2003, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $19million after tax for Con Edison of New York and an increase, compared to 2003, in pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $1million for O&R. This reduction reflects, among other factors, the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years, partially offset by the amortization of a gain on plan assets in 2003 and by the estimated impact in 2004 of recently enacted Medicare legislation (reduction in other postretirement benefit costs of $10million after tax, including $9million for Con Edison of New York and $1million for O&R).
Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce Con Edison of New York's pension and other post retirement benefit net credit by an additional $25million, after tax, in 2005. A 5.0percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2004 as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.8percent would change net income for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $5million in 2005, assuming no change in regulatory treatment.
In accordance with SFAS No.71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the PSC, O&R defers as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses. Con Edison of New York's pending petitions for gas and steam rate increases include, and the company anticipates that its petition for an electric rate increase will include, a proposal for deferred accounting treatment of such expenses. See "Regulatory Matters", below.
Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the unregulated subsidiaries make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. An actuarial valuation of the plan's funded status as of December31, 2003, showed that the fair value of the plan's assets exceeded, by $712million, the plan's accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at that date. However, the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plan's ABO in future years. In that event, each of the Utilities would be required, under SFAS No.87, to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the ABO, plus, in the case of Con Edison of 39 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED New York, its total prepaid pension costs, through a non-cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect net income for common stock.
The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in 2003 under funding regulations and tax laws. O&R made a discretionary contribution of $18million to the plan in 2003. In 2004, O&R and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of $22million and $2million, respectively. The Companies' policy is to fund its accounting cost to the extent it is tax deductible.
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies include the Utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations, workers' compensation claims and Con Edison's legal proceedings relating to its October1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities. See Notes G, K, Q, R, S, T and W to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No.5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
Accounting for Long-Lived Assets SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" requires that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No.144 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.
The adverse market conditions affecting Con Edison's unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets for impairment in 2003. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long-lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy-related and telecommunications businesses. Under SFAS No.144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of those possible outcomes must be weighted. As a result of the tests performed in 2003, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $159million 40 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED ($94million after-tax) for the assets of its unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses. See NoteH to the financial statements.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Financial and Commodity Market Risks" below and NoteP to the financial statements.
Accounting for Goodwill Con Edison adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January1, 2002. In accordance with this standard, Con Edison ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing remaining goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis. Con Edison completed initial goodwill impairment tests and recorded a loss of $34.1million ($20.2million after tax) as of January1, 2002, relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary. The unamortized goodwill of $405.8million, relating to the acquisition of O&R, was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired. See NoteL to the financial statements.
In determining whether or not its goodwill is impaired, Con Edison is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the results of the goodwill impairment test. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.
Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases" and other related accounting pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Notes K and T to the financial statements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below.
The principal factors affecting Con Edison's liquidity at the holding company level are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities. In addition, in 2003 Con Edison issued 11.9million shares of common stock for $431million ($381million of which it invested in Con Edison of New York) and $200million of five-year debt. In 2002, the company issued $325million of 40-year debt (most of which it invested in its unregulated subsidiaries).
The principal factors affecting the Utilities' liquidity are the cash flow generated from operations, construction expenditures and maturities of their debt securities. In addition, Con Edison of New York in 2003 received a $381million capital contribution from Con Edison; in 2002 and 2001 issued $225million and $95million, respectively, of additional debt net of redemptions; and in 2001 received 41 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED net proceeds of $597million from the sale of generating assets, net of a contribution to its nuclear decommissioning trust (see NoteJ to the financial statements). Also, since 2001, Con Edison of New York has incurred substantial, primarily capital, costs in connection with the attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent restoration of lower Manhattan and to date has received reimbursement of such costs of $29million from the federal government (see NoteR to the financial statements). In 2003, O&R redeemed $35million of debt at maturity with commercial paper.
The Companies each believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements, assuming that the Utilities' rate plans reflect their costs of service, including a return on invested capital. See "Regulatory Matters," below and "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Contingencies," above.
Changes in the Companies' cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized as follows: CON EDISON (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 2001 Variance 2002 vs. 2001 Operating activities $ 1,319 $ 1,522 $ (203 ) $ 1,587 $ (65 ) Investing activities (1,527 ) (1,634 ) 107 (941 ) (693 ) Financing activities 143 (115 ) 258 (382 ) 267 Net change for the period (65 ) (227 ) 162 264 (491 ) Balance at beginning of period 132 359 (227 ) 95 264 Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 67 $ 132 $ (65 ) $ 359 $ (227 ) CON EDISON OF NEW YORK (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 2001 Variance 2002 vs. 2001 Operating activities $ 1,169 $ 1,310 $ (141 ) $ 1,306 $ 4 Investing activities (1,337 ) (1,273 ) (64 ) (569 ) (704 ) Financing activities 113 (214 ) 327 (542 ) 328 Net change for the period (55 ) (177 ) 122 195 (372 ) Balance at beginning of period 88 265 (177 ) 70 195 Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 33 $ 88 $ (55 ) $ 265 $ (177 ) 42 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Variance 2003 vs. 2002 2001 Variance 2002 vs. 2001 Operating activities $ 128 $ 104 $ 24 $ 107 $ (3 ) Investing activities (71 ) (60 ) (11 ) (61 ) 1 Financing activities (49 ) (44 ) (5 ) (52 ) 8 Net change for the period 8 - 8 (6 ) 6 Balance at beginning of period 2 2 - 8 (6 ) Balance at end of period (including restricted cash) $ 10 $ 2 $ 8 $ 2 $ - Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as weather and economic conditions. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with rate plans approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdictionthe PSC, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). See "Regulatory Matters" below. In general, changes in the Utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies' cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes, and for Con Edison in 2003, impairment charges. For Con Edison of New York, principal non-cash credits include prepaid pension costs. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in Con Edison of New York's pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" and Notes E and F to the financial statements.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $203million and $141million lower than 2002, respectively. This decrease reflects lower net income at Con Edison of New York (due to a certain extent to costs not reflected in current rates) and for Con Edison (due to greater losses at the unregulated subsidiaries). This decrease also reflects Con Edison of New York's increase in the value of gas in storage (reflecting both higher unit costs and higher volumes) and a higher level of accrued construction commitments at year-end 2002 that were paid for in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deferred income tax expense.
43 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Net cash flows from operating activities in 2003 for O&R were $24million higher than in 2002 due primarily to increased deferred income tax expense, partially offset by the increased value of gas in storage (resulting from higher unit costs and volumes).
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 for Con Edison were $65million lower than in 2001. This decrease was due principally to higher energy costs and sales at the Utilities in December2002 as compared with December2001, resulting in increased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by increased accounts payable balances. The net benefit to cash flows from these activities in 2001 was greater than the benefit in 2002 because high energy costs at year-end 2000 were collected in 2001 and energy purchases at year-end 2001 were lower than the prior year. The change in cash flows also reflects the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds for the Utilities and net cash received related to regulatory liabilities, such as transmission congestion contracts, offset by increased cash expended related to regulatory assets.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 for Con Edison of New York were $4million higher than in 2001. The change in cash flows reflects the aforementioned impact of the timing of energy sales and cost recovery, the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds, and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $107million lower in 2003 than in 2002, due primarily to lower construction expenditures by its unregulated subsidiaries, partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the Utilities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $64million and $11million higher in 2003 than in 2002 for Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively, due primarily to increased construction expenditures.
Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $693million and $704million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, respectively, due primarily to the receipt in 2001 of net proceeds from generation divestiture. See NoteJ to the financial statements. In addition, Con Edison of New York construction expenditures increased in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the company's electric distribution system, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at Con Edison of New York's East River steam-electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project).
Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine-acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134million at December31, 2002, compared with $105million at December31, 2001. In 2000, Con Edison of New York agreed to sell this site for an expected price of $576million to $680million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50million in 44 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED 2000 as a down payment, which Con Edison used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability.
Net cash flows used in investing activities for O&R were $1million lower in 2002 than in 2001.
Cash Flows from/(used in) Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $258million and $327million, respectively in 2003 compared with 2002.
Con Edison's cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December31, 2003, reflect the issuance of 9.6million Con Edison common shares (resulting in proceeds of $381million, which was invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York) and $200million of Con Edison's 3.625percent 5-year Series2003A Debentures (most of which was invested in the unregulated subsidiaries). Cash flows from financing activities in 2002 reflect the issuance of $325million of Con Edison's 7.25percent 40-year Series2002A Debentures (the proceeds of which were used to repay commercial paper). Cash flows from financing activities in both 2003 and 2002 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2003: 2.3million shares for $50million; 2002: 1.7million shares for $25million). In addition, common stock dividends paid in 2003 and 2002 were reduced by $46million and $44million, respectively, to reflect the amount of dividends reinvested in Con Edison common shares through the dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans.
Net cash flows used in financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York decreased $267million and $328million in 2002 compared with 2001, respectively. This decrease reflects principally increased debt financing for construction expenditures at Con Edison of New York and a reduction in the dividends paid by Con Edison of New York to Con Edison. In addition, in September2001, Con Edison of New York used the proceeds from the sale of its nuclear plant to repay outstanding short-term borrowing.
Net cash flows used in financing activities for O&R were $8million lower in 2002 than 2001, due primarily to the retirement of short-term debt in excess of proceeds from issuances.
Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 also reflect Con Edison of New York's (unless otherwise noted) refunding and issuance of long-term debt and preferred stock as follows: 2003  Redeemed in advance of maturity $275million 7.75percent 35-year Series1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures using cash held for that purpose at December31, 2002;  Redeemed at maturity $150million of 6.375percent 10-year Series1993D Debentures and issued $175million 5.875percent 30-year Series2003A Debentures; 45 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED  Redeemed $380million 7.5percent 30-year Series1993G Debentures using the net proceeds from the issuance of $200million 3.85percent 10-year Series2003B Debentures and $200million 5.10percent 30-year Series2003C Debentures;  O&R redeemed at maturity its $35million 6.56percent 10-year Series1993D Debentures using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.
2002  Redeemed at maturity $150million 6.625percent 9-year Series1993C;  Redeemed at maturity $150million variable-rate 5-year Series1997A and issued $300million of 5.625percent 10-year Series2002A Debentures;  Redeemed at maturity $37million of Cumulative Preferred Stock $100 par value 6.125percent SeriesJ;  Issued $500million of 4.875percent 10-year Series2002B Debentures.
2001  Redeemed at maturity $150million 6.5percent 10-year Series1993B;  Issued $400million 7.5percent 40-year Series2001A;  Issued $225million variable rate 35-year tax-exempt debt Series2001A through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and redeemed in advance of maturity $128million 7.5percent 25-year Series1991A and $100million 6.75percent 25-year Series1992A NYSERDA bonds;  Issued $98million variable rate 35-year tax-exempt debt through NYSERDA and redeemed in advance of maturity $100million 6.375percent 25-year Series1992B NYSERDA bonds;  Redeemed at maturity $150million variable rate 5-year Series1996B.
In 2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6million aggregate principal amount of its tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10-year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.7percent annual interest rate. In addition, Con Edison of New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with these bonds pursuant to which the company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375percent. See NoteP to the financial statements.
Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as "Notes payable"). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at 46 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and the average daily balance for 2003, 2002 and 2001 for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted Average Yield) Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Con Edison $ 156 $ 326 $ 151 $ 256 $ 176 $ 242 Con Edison of New York $ 99 $ 179 $ - $ 157 - $ 164 O&R $ 15 $ 33 $ 1 $ 1 $ 17 $ 28 Weighted average yield 1.0 % 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.7 % 2.0 % 4.6 % External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets.

In January2004, Con Edison of New York issued $245.3million of its variable rate, tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series2004A and B, the proceeds of which are being used to redeem in advance of maturity its fixed rate, tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series1993A, B and C.
In February2004, Con Edison of New York issued $200million of 4.7percent 10-year Series2004A Debentures and $200million of 5.7percent 30-year Series2004B Debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity the company's $150million 7.125percent Series1994A Debentures and for general corporate purposes.
Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities at December31, 2003, compared with December31, 2002, that have impacted the Companies' consolidated statements of cash flows. The changes in these balances are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations. With respect to regulatory liabilities, see NoteB to the financial statements.

Energy sales and purchased power costs are discussed below under "Results of Operations." Gas in storage increased at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due primarily to higher unit costs and volumes of gas in storage at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002.
Prepaid pension costs for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due to the recognition of the current period's pension credits.
Accounts payable for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York decreased at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due primarily to a higher level of accrued construction commitments at year-end 2002. This decrease was offset in part by increased electric purchased power costs for Con Edison of New York at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002, reflecting higher unit costs.
Superfund and other environmental liabilities for the Companies increased at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 reflecting increased estimates for investigation, removal and remediation costs.
Deferred income taxesliability increased at December31, 2003 as compared with year-end 2002 due primarily to accelerating tax deductions for capitalized indirect costs.
Transmission congestion contracts (See "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" in NoteB to the financial statements) increased at December31, 2003 compared with year-end 2002 reflecting proceeds from the sale through the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) of transmission rights on Con Edison of New York's transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit.
Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper. In addition, Con Edison's ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.
For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see NoteC to the financial statements.
For information on the Companies' commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see NoteD to the financial statements.
48 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings.
In December2001, the PSC authorized the Utilities to issue up to $1.95billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which Con Edison of New York issued $195million and $525million of debt securities in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, the PSC authorized the refunding of the Utilities' outstanding debt securities and preferred stock.
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings. See NoteT to the financial statements.
In August2002, Congress appropriated funds for which Con Edison of New York is eligible to apply, to recover costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. In accordance with procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, Con Edison of New York submitted its initial application for funds in October2003 and received the first installment of $29million on October31, 2003. The Company will submit additional applications when appropriate. See NoteR to the financial statements.
For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was: Earnings to Fixed Charges 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 Con Edison 2.7 3.1 3.3 3.0 3.8 Con Edison of New York 3.4 3.4 3.7 3.2 4.2 O&R 4.4 3.3 3.5 3.4 2.5 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was: As of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison 48.0 48.1 49.8 Con Edison of New York 49.3 46.6 47.2 O&R 55.1 53.6 50.0 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P-1, A-1 and F1, respectively, by Moody's Investor Service,Inc.

The unsecured debt of the Utilities is rated A1, A and A+, respectively, by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.
49 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Capital Requirements The following table compares the Companies' capital requirements for the years 2001 through 2003 and estimated amounts for 2004 and 2005.
(Millions of Dollars) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Regulated utility construction expenditures Con Edison of New York $ 984 $ 1,082 $ 1,167 $ 1,060 $ 1,362 O&R 59 58 71 83 81 Total regulated construction expenditures $ 1,043 $ 1,140 $ 1,238 $ 1,143 $ 1,443 Unregulated subsidiaries construction expenditures 154 282 105 30 29 Sub-total 1,197 1,422 1,343 1,173 1,472 Retirement of long-term securities at maturity Con Edison of New York 628 337 805 150 450 O&R   35   Unregulated subsidiaries 10 11 16 16 17 Total retirement of long-term securities at maturity 638 348 856 166 467 Total $ 1,835 $ 1,770 $ 2,200 $ 1,339 $ 1,939 Con Edison of New York's utility construction expenditures in 2003 and 2004 reflect programs to meet electric load growth and reliability needs, gas infrastructure expenditures, the East River Repowering Project and expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack (see NoteR to the financial statements). The increase for 2005 reflects an anticipated higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system.
The unregulated subsidiaries' construction expenditures declined in 2003 and are expected to continue to decline, consistent with there being no major construction or acquisition expected for those businesses. At December31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edison's investment balance in these subsidiaries, on an unconsolidated basis, was $703million and $790million, respectively.
Contractual Obligations The following tables summarize the Companies' material obligations at December31, 2003, to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long-term debt, capital lease obligations and other long-term liabilities are included on their balance sheets. Operating leases and non-utility generator (NUG) contracts (for 50 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Amounts shown for purchase obligations were derived from the Utilities' purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For most of its other purchase obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized, typically a 10percent commitment. These other purchase obligations reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs entered into by the Utilities in running their day to day operations. Payments of the other purchase obligations are assumed to be made ratably over the terms of the obligations.
(b) Represents commitments to purchase electric energy and capacity, natural gas and natural gas pipeline capacity and operation and maintenance generation service agreements entered into by Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries.
51 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED The Companies' commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments are their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets and Con Edison's guarantees of certain obligations of its subsidiaries. See Notes S and T to the financial statements.
Electric Power Requirements In 2003, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others and through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2004.
In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchase power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial and Commodity Market RisksCommodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and have entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in the summer of 2004. See Notes I and P to the financial statements. O&R's New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2004. Con Edison of New York also owns approximately 630 MW of generating stations associated primarily with its steam system, located in New York City, the electricity output of which it sells through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.
The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. In a July1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New York's request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO.
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries sell electricity in the wholesale and retail NYISO and other markets. At December31, 2003, Con Edison Development's interests in electric generating facilities amounted to 1,668 MW. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities under 52 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED contract or on the wholesale electricity markets. See "Financial and Commodity Market RisksCommodity Price Risk," below.
REGULATORY MATTERS For additional information about the electric, gas and steam agreements discussed below, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteB to the financial statements.
Electric In July2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. After receiving over 1,000 comments on the proposals contained in its SMD NOPR, the FERC issued its Wholesale Market Platform "White Paper" on April28, 2003. The White Paper built on the existing rules contained in Order 2000. Key among the attributes discussed in the White Paper are flexibility on the scope and configuration to allow for both Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs); the need for a regional planning process; the need for rate mechanisms that minimize cost shifts; the need to eliminate "seams" charges between ISOs and RTOs; the use of a real-time market for energy to resolve imbalances; and the need for an approach to manage congestion, which could include locational pricing with firm transmission rights, that protects against manipulation, utilizes the grid effectively and promotes the use of lower cost generation. In addition, each region within an RTO or ISO will determine how it will ensure that its region has sufficient resources to meet customers' needs. Since releasing its White Paper, the FERC has held technical conferences on various issues. However, it has not issued any specific orders for compliance. The energy bill introduced in Congress in 2003 contained a provision remanding SMD to the FERC and requiring that no new rule could be issued before October31, 2006 or could become effective before December31, 2006. The energy bill was not passed in 2003. The Senate leadership has stated its intent to bring the bill up for vote again in 2004.
In September1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129million in 1998, $80million in 1999, $103million in 2000 and $209million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to be served by competitive energy suppliers.
In November2000, the PSC approved an October2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture-related issues.
53 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five-year period ending March2005. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
O&R has entered into settlement agreements or similar arrangements with the PSC, NJBPU and PPUC that provide for a transition to a competitive electric market.
In October2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covers the period from July1, 2003 through October31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11million (pre-tax) between July2003 and June2006. During the second half of 2003, O&R amortized $3.7million of the $11million. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 12.75percent return on common equity during the three year period from July2003 through June2006. The period from July2006 through October2006 will not be subject to earnings sharing.
In July2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of O&R, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring AgreementsElectric" in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements. The NJBPU ordered a $7million decrease in RECO's electric base rates, effective August2003, authorized RECO's recovery of approximately $83million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19million of such costs and associated interest. At December31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for $13million of the disallowance, and at June30, 2003 reserved an additional $6million for the disallowance.
Gas In November2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for gas service by $108million (9.8percent), effective October2004.
Con Edison of New York is currently operating under a gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April2002. The Agreement covers the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced retail sales and transportation rates by $25million, on an annual basis.
54 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000.
In October2003, the PSC approved an agreement among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for gas service. The O&R gas agreement, which covers the period from November1, 2003 through October31, 2006, provides for annual increases in gas base rates of $9million (5.8percent) effective November2003, $9million (4.8percent) effective November2004 and $5million (2.5percent) effective November2005. The O&R gas agreement also continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11percent return on common equity over the term of the agreement. The agreement also contains incentives under which, among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer migration to its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets for interruptible sales and transportation customers.
In November2000, the PSC also approved a gas rate agreement between O&R, PSC Staff and certain other parties covering the three-year period November2000 through October2003.
Steam In November2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase annual charges for steam service by $129million (14.6percent), effective October2004.
Con Edison of New York is currently operating under a steam rate agreement that was approved by the PSC in December2000. The agreement provided for a $16.6million steam rate increase, which took effect October2000 and, with limited exceptions, provided for no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004.
FINANCIAL AND COMMODITY MARKET RISKS The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate-debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2003, each 10percent variation in interest rates applicable to the Companies' 55 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED variable rate debt of $816million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1million. For each 10percent change in Con Edison of New York's and O&R's variable interest rates applicable to their variable rate debt of $714million and $59million, respectively, annual interest expense for Con Edison of New York would change by $1million and there would be no material impact for O&R.
In addition, Con Edison and its subsidiaries, from time to time, enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteP to the financial statements.
Commodity Price Risk Con Edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See NoteP to the financial statements.
Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2003, each 10percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $12million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $8million is for Con Edison of New York and $4million for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. The unregulated subsidiaries estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December31, 2003, and 2002, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2003 2002 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ 1 $ 1 High $ 3 $ 3 Low $ - $ 1 56 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the unregulated energy subsidiaries. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty's nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff.
Con Edison's unregulated energy subsidiaries had $71million of credit exposure, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2003, of which $63million was with investment grade counterparties and $8million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange or independent system operators.
Investment Risk The Companies' investment risk relates to the investment of the assets of their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above. The Companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65percent equities and 35percent fixed income and other securities. At December31, 2003, the pension plan investments consisted of 64percent equity and 36percent fixed income and other securities. See NoteE to the financial statements.
ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Unregulated subsidiaries of Con Edison engage in energy trading activities that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. See NoteP to the financial statements.
Prior to October2002, these contracts were accounted for under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As of October2002, energy and energy-related trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS No.133. Such contracts are marked to market with gains and losses recognized in earnings. For the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, Con Edison recognized in income net unrealized pre-tax losses of $3million and $1million, respectively, excluding the effect of a cumulative adjustment due to a change in accounting principle. Contracts that did not fall within the scope of SFAS No.133 were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in December2002. See NoteP to the financial statements.
57 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED The changes in fair value of energy trading net assets for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: Twelve months ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Fair value of net assets outstanding - beginning of period $ 5 $ 11 Change in fair value during the period: Unrealized gain at inception - 11 Net premium paid/(received) 2 (2 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - (3 ) Changes in fair value prior to settlement 25 6 Fair value realized at settlement of contracts (28 ) (18 ) Total change in fair value during the period (1 ) (6 ) Fair value of net assets outstandingend of period $ 4 $ 5 As of December31, 2003, the sources of fair value of the energy trading net assets were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Fair Value of Net Assets at Period End Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1-3 years Maturity 4-5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices provided by external sources $ 7 $ - $ - $ - $ 7 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (3 ) - - - (3 ) Total $ 4 $ - $ - $ - $ 4 "Prices provided by external sources" represent the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
"Prices based on models and other valuation methods" represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based on underlying contractual terms. The models reflect management's estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk-free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of energy commodity prices and contractual volumes. Counterparty specific credit quality, market price uncertainty and other risks are also factored into the models.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see NoteG to the financial statements.
58 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED IMPACT OF INFLATION The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the asset upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies' prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies' services will increase or decline. Over the past 20years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially.

See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA and "Regulatory Matters" in NoteB to the financial statements.
CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Electric Con Edison of New York's electric operating revenues increased $559million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power costs of $503million (which are recoverable 60 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED from customers), and a lower amount reserved for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return to be retained for customer benefit ($31million). Changes to operating revenues also reflect variations in electric sales.
Con Edison of New York's electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 12,441 12,481 (40 ) (0.3 )% Commercial/Industrial 18,033 19,111 (1,078 ) (5.6 ) Other 154 181 (27 ) (14.9 ) Total Full Service Customers 30,628 31,773 (1,145 ) (3.6 ) Retail access customers 12,637 11,926 711 6.0 Sub-total 43,265 43,699 (434 ) (1.0 ) NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,470 10,267 203 2.0 Total Service Area 53,735 53,966 (231 ) (0.4 )% Electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New York's service area decreased 0.4percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in delivery volumes reflects the cool weather in the second quarter of 2003 and the lower than normal number of hot days during the summer of 2003 compared with an exceptionally warm summer in 2002, partially offset by the cold winter weather in 2003 compared with the mild winter in 2002. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New York's service area increased 0.6percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Weather-adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed.
Con Edison of New York's electric purchased power costs increased $477million in 2003 as compared with 2002, due to an increase in the average unit price of purchased power. This increase was offset in part by lower usage by the company's full service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the company's retail access programs. Electric fuel costs increased $26million, reflecting an increase in the average unit price of fuel.
Con Edison of New York's electric operating income decreased $1million in 2003 compared with 2002. The principal component of the decrease was an increase in other operations and maintenance expense ($41milliondue primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), property taxes ($17million) and depreciation ($16million). The increase in expenses was offset in part 61 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED by higher net revenues (operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs$56million), lower state and local revenue taxes ($7million), sales and use tax ($5million) and payroll taxes ($3million).
Gas Con Edison of New York's gas operating revenues in 2003 increased $250million compared with 2002, due primarily to the higher cost of purchased gas of $244million (which is recoverable from customers), and higher sales volumes.
Con Edison of New York's revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income.
Con Edison of New York's gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 51,944 44,163 7,781 17.6 % General 36,840 32,682 4,158 12.7 Firm Transportation 16,486 15,695 791 5.0 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 105,270 92,540 12,730 13.8 Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 15,247 12,622 2,625 20.8 Non-Firm Transportation of Gas NYPA 23,360 25,467 (2,107 ) (8.3 ) Generation Plants 43,808 77,516 (33,708 ) (43.5 ) Total NYPA and Generation Plants 67,168 102,983 (35,815 ) (34.8 ) Other 17,766 22,301 (4,535 ) (20.3 ) Total Sales and Transportation 205,451 230,446 (24,995 ) (10.8 )% Con Edison of New York's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.8percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period and increased new business. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August2003 regional power outage, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company's service area increased 3.6percent in 2003.
Non-firm transportation of customer-owned gas to NYPA and electric generating plants decreased 34.8percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, electric generating plants in the company's gas service area utilized oil rather 62 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED than gas for a significant portion of their generation. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation.
Con Edison of New York's purchased gas cost increased $244million in 2003 compared with 2002, due to higher unit costs and increased sales volumes for firm sales customers.
Con Edison of New York's gas operating income decreased $10million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting primarily an increase in other operations and maintenance expense ($4milliondue primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), depreciation ($4million), state and local taxes on revenues ($5million) and income tax ($4million). The increases in expenses were offset in part by higher net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale$7million).
Steam Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues increased $133million and steam operating income decreased $1million in 2003 compared with 2002. The higher revenues reflect higher sales volumes due to the cold winter weather in 2003 as compared with the mild weather in 2002. The increase also includes higher fuel and purchased power costs ($124million) in 2003 compared with 2002. The decrease in steam operating income reflects primarily higher income taxes ($10milliondue to higher taxable income and a lower level of removal costs in 2003) and operations and maintenance expense ($3milliondue to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits) offset in part by an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $9million and lower state and local taxes on steam revenues ($4million).
Con Edison of New York's steam sales and deliveries in 2003 compared with 2002 were: MILLIONS OF POUNDS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation General 729 600 129 21.5 % Apartment house 7,845 7,022 823 11.7 Annual power 17,674 16,897 777 4.6 Total Sales 26,248 24,519 1,729 7.1 % Steam sales volumes increased 7.1percent in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August2003 regional power outage, steam sales increased 0.9percent.
63 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New York's largest operating expenses.
The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 651 $ 630 $ 21 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 321 327 (6 ) Payroll taxes 50 55 (5 ) Other taxes 18 28 (10 ) Total $ 1,040 (a) $ 1,040 (a) $ - (a) Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customer in 2003 and 2002 were $1,393 and $1,352million, respectively.
Effective January2003, New York City increased Con Edison of New York's annual property taxes by $94million. Under the company's rate agreements, the company is deferring most of the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers.
Other Income Other income (deductions) decreased $19million in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting $27million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim recorded in 2002, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense in 2003 as a result of the recognition in 2002 of income tax benefits relating to the September2001 sale of the company's nuclear generating unit.
Net Interest Charges Net interest charges decreased $16million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19million) recorded in 2002.
Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased $18million in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily as a result of less flow-through (non-deferred) depreciation for tax purposes. In addition, lower operating income taxes in 2002 reflected a tax benefit from an Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years 1995 through 1997 and a write-off of excess deferred tax reserves.
O&R Electric Electric operating revenues increased $54million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher purchased power costs in 2003 and accounting for the 2003 O&R electric rate agreement and the NJBPU ruling on the RECO rate petitions.
64 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED O&R's electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 1,769 1,815 (46 ) (2.5 )% Commercial/Industrial 2,277 2,393 (116 ) (4.8 ) Other 111 111 - - Total Full Service Customers 4,157 4,319 (162 ) (3.8 ) Retail access customers 1,455 1,235 220 17.8 Total Service Area 5,612 5,554 58 1.0 Electric delivery volumes in O&R's service area increased 1.0percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due to the growth in the number of customers, higher average customer usage, and the positive effect of the cooler-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2003, partially offset by negative impact of weather on the last nine months of 2003. After adjusting for weather variations and the August2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in O&R's service area increased 2.5percent in 2003.
O&R's purchased power cost increased $31million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to an increase in the average unit cost and the regulatory actions referenced above. This increase was offset by lower energy usage by the company's full-service customers and higher volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&R's retail access program.
O&R's electric operating income decreased $6million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due primarily to the referenced regulatory actions.
Gas O&R's gas operating revenues increased $38million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher cost of gas purchased for resale in 2003, higher firm sales and transportation volumes and the impact of the 2003 gas rate agreement.
65 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED O&R's gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2003 compared with 2002 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 10,810 10,203 607 5.9 % General 3,314 3,295 19 0.6 Firm Transportation 8,498 6,368 2,130 33.4 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 22,622 19,866 2,756 13.9 Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,833 7,366 (533 ) (7.2 ) Non-Firm Transportation of Gas Generation Plants 2,833 13,983 (11,150 ) (79.7 ) Other 1,134 1,057 77 7.3 Total Sales and Transportation 33,422 42,272 (8,850 ) (20.9 )% O&R's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers increased 13.9percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects the impact of the cold weather in the 2003 winter period compared with the mild weather in the 2002 winter period. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August2003 regional power outage, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 3.0percent higher in 2003 compared with 2002.
Non-firm transportation of customer-owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 79.7percent in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to higher gas prices. In 2003, because of the relative prices of gas and fuel oil, power plants in the company's gas service area utilized oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant completed a construction project to directly connect to a gas transmission provider. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation.
O&R's cost of gas purchased for resale increased $31million in 2003 as compared with 2002 due to increased sales to firm customers and increased gas unit costs in 2003. The increase is offset in part by increased volumes of gas purchased from other suppliers by participants in O&R's retail access program. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Gas operating income increased $2million in 2003 as compared with 2002. The increase reflects an increase in net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) of $7million, which is due primarily to increased sales and the referenced regulatory actions. The increase in net revenues was offset in part by increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of $2million and increased federal and state income tax of $3million.
66 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased $2million in 2003 compared with 2002.

(b) Includes a sales and use tax refund of approximately $800,000.
Income Taxes Operating income taxes increased by $9million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to the result of less flow-through (non-deferred) depreciation for tax purposes.
Other Income O&R's other income (deductions) decreased $3million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) of losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to investments in marketable securities.
Net Interest Charges O&R's net interest charges decreased by $7million in 2003 compared with 2002, due primarily to the company recording interest charges of $5million in 2002 as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on the company's deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey and to lower interest on long-term debt as a result of the redemption of a $35million, 10-year debenture in March2003 (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources," above).
67 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER Unregulated subsidiaries' operating income for 2003 was $122million lower than 2002. Operating revenues increased $292million in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to higher sales from Con Edison Development's increased generating capacity and increased retail electric sales at Con Edison Solutions.
Unregulated subsidiaries' operating expenses, excluding income taxes, increased by $502million, reflecting principally increased fuel and purchased power costs of $260million, impairment charges of $159million and increased operation and maintenance expenses of $83million. See NoteH to the financial statements. The increase in operation and maintenance expenses was attributable to increased costs at Con Edison Development ($51million), primarily to operate the new generation assets, Con Edison Communications' increased operating costs reflecting expansion of the business ($23million), and higher depreciation for additional telecommunications facilities and generating assets placed in service ($13million), offset in part by lower operation and maintenance costs at Con Edison Solutions ($6million).
Operating income taxes decreased $88million for 2003 as compared with 2002 reflecting primarily lower taxable income (including the tax-effect of the aforementioned impairment charges).
Unregulated subsidiaries' other income (deductions) increased $1million and interest charges were lower by $1million for 2003 as compared with 2002.
Unregulated subsidiaries' earnings reflect an increase of $25million for 2003 as compared with 2002 resulting from the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles adopted in each year. For 2003, the positive cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $3million (after tax) at Con Edison Development related to mark-to-market gains applicable to power sales contracts at certain generating plants, partially offset by the impact of the financial statement consolidation of its Newington plant. For 2002, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles included charges for goodwill impairment of certain generating assets at Con Edison Development, totaling $20million (after tax), and a charge of $2million (after tax) at Con Edison Energy relating to the accounting for certain contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities.
Earnings attributable to Other, representing the parent company and inter-company transactions, were $9million lower for 2003 as compared with 2002 primarily reflecting higher interest expenses.

CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Electric Con Edison of New York's electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $575million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $227million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer 69 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40million), a reserve established in 2002 related to the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit ($25million), the amortization of the loss ($30million) related to the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the company's rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather.
Con Edison of New York's electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December31, 2002 December31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 12,481 12,049 432 3.6 % Commercial/Industrial 19,111 19,839 (728 ) (3.7 ) Other 181 166 15 9.0 Total Full Service Customers 31,773 32,054 (281 ) (0.9 ) Retail access customers 11,926 10,520 1,406 13.4 Sub-total 43,699 42,574 1,125 2.6 NYPA, Municipal Agency and Other Sales 10,267 10,476 (209 ) (2.0 ) Total Service Area 53,966 53,050 916 1.7 % Electricity delivery volumes in Con Edison of New York's service territory increased 1.7percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects the impact of the hot summer weather, offset in part by the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volumes in the service territory increased 0.5percent in 2002.
The company's electric purchased power costs decreased $175million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs. This decrease was offset in part by the company's increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit in September2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52million as a result of decreased generation at company-owned power plants. In general, the company recovers prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.
The company's electric operating income decreased $93million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $348million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as 70 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating income. The decrease in net electric revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($137million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001 but not in 2002, and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($32million) and lower revenue taxes ($26million). The decrease is also offset by lower operating income tax of $62million.
Gas Con Edison of New York's gas operating revenues decreased $223million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($194million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April2002. Gas operating income decreased $8million in 2002, reflecting a $29million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($10million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16million), reduced revenue taxes ($10million) and lower income taxes ($9million).
Con Edison of New York's gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December31, 2002 December31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 44,163 46,506 (2,343 ) (5.0 )% General 32,682 35,118 (2,436 ) (6.9 ) Firm Transportation 15,695 14,280 1,415 9.9 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 92,540 95,904 (3,364 ) (3.5 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 12,622 14,731 (2,109 ) (14.3 ) Non-Firm Transportation of Gas NYPA 25,467 13,762 11,705 85.1 Generation Plants 77,516 62,991 14,525 23.1 Total NYPA and Generation Plants 102,983 76,753 26,230 34.2 Other 22,301 15,718 6,583 41.9 Total Sales and Transportation 230,446 203,106 27,340 13.5 % Con Edison of New York's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.5percent in 2002 compared with 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. After 71 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company's service territory decreased 1.5percent in the 2002.
The company's gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather-normalization provision that applies to the company's gas business moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on gas operating income.
Steam Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues decreased $100million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs and volumes. Steam operating income increased $8million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9million and lower income taxes of $11million, offset in part by a decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11million.
Con Edison of New York's steam sales and deliveries in 2002 compared with 2001 were: MILLIONS OF POUNDS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation General 600 620 (20 ) (3.2 )% Apartment house 7,022 7,050 (28 ) (0.4 ) Annual power 16,897 17,657 (760 ) (4.3 ) Total Sales 24,519 25,327 (808 ) (3.2 )% Steam sales volume decreased 3.2percent in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales volume decreased 1.4percent.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2002 2001 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 630 $ 620 $ 10 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 327 365 (38 ) Payroll taxes 55 56 (1 ) Other taxes 28 26 2 Total $ 1,040 (a) $ 1,067 (a) $ (27 ) (a)Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 and 2001 were $1,352million and $1,414million, respectively.
72 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Other Income Investment income decreased $4million in 2002 compared with 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short-term cash investments in 2002 compared with 2001. For 2001, the company had more cash on hand than in 2002, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $9million in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other income increased $42million in 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to $27million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10million write-off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund, a $9million increase in interest earned on regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Regulated Public UtilitiesSFAS No.71," above), offset in part by reduced income of $3million from non-utility operations. Income tax expense decreased $4million in 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits relating to the September2001 sale of the Company's nuclear generating unit.
Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $7million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long-term debt of $15million.
Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $29million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue-based taxes and replaced them with a net income-based tax. State income taxes decreased $57million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over- or under-collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and M to the financial statements.
O&R Electric Electric operating revenues decreased $62million in 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower purchased power costs and tax recoveries in 2002.
73 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED O&R's electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were: MILLIONS OF KWHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious 1,815 1,773 42 2.4 % Commercial/Industrial 2,393 2,567 (174 ) (6.8 ) Other 111 110 1 0.9 Total Full Service Customers 4,319 4,450 (131 ) (2.9 ) Retail access customers 1,235 799 436 54.6 Total Service Area 5,554 5,249 305 5.8 % Electricity delivery volumes in 2002 increased 5.8percent compared with 2001 due to warmer than normal summer weather, customer growth and higher average usage. After adjusting for weather variations, total electricity delivery volumes were 3.2percent higher in 2002. Net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power) were $8million higher in 2002 than in 2001.
Purchased power costs decreased $70million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting decreases in the unit cost of purchased power and increased volumes of electricity purchased by customers from other suppliers.
Electric operating income increased $8million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This increase reflects the impact of higher net electric revenues along with lower New York state and local income and revenue taxes, offset in part by higher operation and maintenance charges and depreciation costs.
Gas Gas operating revenues decreased $39million in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower gas costs and sales to firm customers in 2002.
O&R's gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2002 compared with 2001 were: THOUSANDS OF DTHS Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2002 December 31, 2001 Variation Percent Variation Firm Sales Residential 10,203 11,724 (1,521 ) (12.8 )% General 3,295 3,751 (456 ) (12.2 ) Firm Transportation 6,368 4,724 1,644 34.8 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 19,866 20,199 (333 ) (1.6 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 7,366 7,264 102 1.4 Non-Firm Transportation of Gas Generation Plants 13,983 11,427 2,556 22.4 Other 1,057 1,039 18 1.7 Total Sales and Transportation 42,272 39,929 2,343 5.9 % 74 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED O&R's sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 1.6percent in 2002 compared with 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3percent lower for 2002 compared with 2001.
Net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) were $1million higher in 2002 due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off-system gas sales.
The cost of gas purchased for resale was $40million less in 2002 than in 2001, reflecting lower sales volumes and unit costs.
Decreased gas revenues also reflect the reduced requirement for the company to buy gas for resale because of an increase in the purchase of gas by customers from other suppliers.
Gas operating income increased by $1million in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to higher net revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, offset in part by lower late payment charge revenues and higher depreciation.
Other Operations and Maintenance Other operations and maintenance expense increased $2million in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase was attributable primarily to higher electric transmission and distribution expenditures, partially offset by lower customer bad debt and collections expense.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased by $2million in 2002 compared with 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower New York State revenue taxes of $3million, which resulted from reduced tax rates and lower energy costs billed to customers. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher property taxes of $1million.
The principal components of, and variations in, taxes, other than income taxes were: (Millions of Dollars) 2002 2001 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 27 $ 26 $ 1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 21 24 (3 ) Payroll taxes 4 4 - Other taxes - - - Total $ 52 (a) $ 54 (a) $ (2 ) (a)Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2002 and 2001 were $71million and $66million, respectively.
75 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (COMBINED FOR CON EDISON, CON EDISON OF NEW YORK AND O&R)  CONTINUED Net Interest Charges Interest charges increased by $4million in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on O&R's deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey ($5million) and lower allowance for borrowed funds used during construction ($1million). These expenses were offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1million that resulted from lower average debt balances and interest rates in 2002.
Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $1million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower state income taxes. State income taxes decreased primarily as a result of a 0.5percent reduction in the New York State tax rate. Excluding certain taxes in New York that are reconciled to amounts included in rates, income taxes increased by $2million due primarily to higher operating income in 2002.
UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER Earnings for the unregulated subsidiaries decreased $14million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting a non-cash, after-tax charge in 2002 of $22million for changes in accounting principles (see Notes L, P and T to the financial statements) and continued start-up losses in the company's wholesale telecommunications business, including a non-cash, after-tax charge in 2002 of $5million for a write-down of an investment in Neon Communications,Inc. (NEON). The decrease in earnings was offset, in part, by higher electric retail sales volumes and gross margins, the capitalization of previously expensed project development costs on generation assets ($4million after tax) and unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative instruments ($7million after tax).

106 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS General These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements of each of Consolidated Edison,Inc., a holding company, and its subsidiaries (Con Edison), Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison of New York) and Orange& Rockland Utilities,Inc. and its subsidiaries (O&R). Con Edison of New York and O&R, which are regulated utilities, are subsidiaries of Con Edison. Con Edison also has the following unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity and gas to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R, and also offers energy-related services; Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. Con Edison of New York and O&R are referred to in these notes as the "Utilities." Con Edison and the Utilities are collectively referred to in these combined notes as the "Companies." Neither Con Edison of New York nor O&R makes any representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.
NoteA - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation Con Edison's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Con Edison and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Utilities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
The Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in NoteB. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, 107 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED and are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities' regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Other significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced in NoteE (Pension Benefits), NoteF (Other Postretirement Benefits), NoteK (Leases), NoteL (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and NoteP (Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities) to the financial statements.
Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. At December31, 2003, the Utilities reclassified the cost of removal less salvage value originally included in the accumulated depreciation reserve to a regulatory liability in accordance with SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The amounts reclassified for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R were $777million, $721million and $56million in 2003 and $813million, $773million and $40million in 2002, respectively.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities' own funds are credited to other income (deductions). The AFDC rates for the Utilities were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison of New York 7.1 % 6.8 % 6.8 % O&R 1.1 % 8.4 % 4.6 % The Utilities generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors.
The average depreciation rates for the Utilities were as follow: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison of New York 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.1 % O&R 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.3 % 108 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The estimated lives for utility plant for Con Edison of New York range from 25 to 80years for electric, 15 to 85years for gas, 30 to 75years for steam and 8 to 50years for general plant. For O&R, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 65years for electric, 7 to 75years for gas and 5 to 55years for general plant.
Non-Utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication facilities that are currently not utilized within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries, non-utility plant consists primarily of generating assets and telecommunication facilities. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 40years for generating assets, 3 to 20 years for telecommunication facilities and 3 to 50years for other property.
The average non-utility depreciation rates for Con Edison Development and Con Edison Communications were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison Development 3.0 % 3.9 % 4.0 % Con Edison Communications 8.4 % 10.0 % 5.8 % In 2002, in accordance with SFAS No.34, "Capitalization of Interest Costs," Con Edison capitalized interest on its borrowings associated with the unregulated subsidiaries' capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such capitalized interest cost for 2003 and 2002 was $6million and $14million, respectively. No amounts were capitalized in 2001.
Revenues The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas or steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period all net interruptible gas revenues not authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to be retained by the Utilities for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. O&R and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy usage not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edison's and O&R's balance sheets at December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 Con Edison $ 61 $ 54 O&R $ 18 $ 20 109 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Recoverable Energy Costs The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed energy costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). For Con Edison of New York, rate provisions also include a possible incentive or penalty of up to $25million annually relating to electric costs (see "Energy Price Hedging" in NoteP). For O&R gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a subsequent 12-month period.
The difference between purchased power costs initially billed to the Utilities by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and the cost of power subsequently determined by the NYISO to have actually been supplied is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities' customers. At December31, 2003, Con Edison of New York had deferred $134million of refunds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability. In New Jersey, O&R's subsidiary purchases energy under competitive bidding supervised by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) for contracts ranging from one to three years. Base rates are adjusted to conform to contracted amounts when new contracts take effect and differences between actual costs and revenues collected, chiefly attributable to differences between estimated and actual customer consumption, are reconciled at a later date. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements- Electric" in NoteB for 2003 NJBPU ruling regarding previously deferred purchased power costs. In Pennsylvania, O&R's subsidiary recovers fuel costs based on a rate allowed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC).
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries, which, depending on the subsidiaries' percentage ownership, are recorded at cost, accounted for under the equity method or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases." See NoteK for a discussion of investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions and NoteH for a discussion of Con Edison Development's impairment charge related to its Genor generating asset. Con Edison of New York's investments are recorded under the equity method.
110 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or "turn-around" of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense (see NoteM). In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No.109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries filea consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays tax or receives a benefit based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.
State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed effective January1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to the tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and the actual tax expense under the new tax law until that expense is incorporated in base rates.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries filea combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives a benefit based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
Taxes Other than Income Taxes The PSC requires New York regulated utility companies to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is part of the PSC approved revenue requirement within each of the respective rate agreements.
111 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison $ 11 $ 11 $ 14 Con Edison of New York $ 10 $ 11 $ 14 O&R $ 1 $ - $ - Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Earnings Per Common Share In accordance with SFAS No.128, "Earnings per Share," Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders ("Net income for common stock" on Con Edison's consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.
Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock and stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of the common shares during the reporting period. See NoteN.
112 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Basic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars/Shares in Millions) 2003 2002 2001 Income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 525 $ 668 $ 682 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax 3 (22 ) - Net income for common stock $ 528 $ 646 $ 682 Average number of shares outstanding - Basic 221 213 212 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities 1 1 1 Average number of shares outstanding - Diluted 222 214 213 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - BASIC Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 2.37 $ 3.14 $ 3.22 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 0.02 (0.11 ) - After cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 2.39 $ 3.03 $ 3.22 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 2.36 $ 3.13 $ 3.21 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 0.02 (0.11 ) - After cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 2.38 $ 3.02 $ 3.21 Stock options to purchase 7million, 6million and 5million Con Edison common shares for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were not included in the respective period's computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the option was greater than the average market price of the common shares.
113 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Stock-Based Compensation Con Edison accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value model of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related interpretations. All options and units granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. No compensation expense has been reflected in the income statement for any period presented except as shown below and as described in NoteN. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and DisclosureAn Amendment of FASB Statement No.123," for the purposes of recognizing compensation expense on employee stock-based arrangements.

Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
114 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED NoteB - Regulatory Matters Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric In September1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended March31, 2002, a reasonable opportunity for recovery of "strandable costs" and the divestiture of electric generation capacity by the company.
At December31, 2003, approximately 92,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing approximately 28percent of aggregate customer peak load were purchasing electricity from other suppliers under the electric retail access program (which is available to all of the company's electric customers). The company delivers electricity to customers in this program through its regulated transmission and distribution systems. In general, its delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable customers, less an amount reflecting costs otherwise associated with supplying customers with energy and capacity.
Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates, on an annual basis, by $129million in 1998, $80million in April1999, $103million in April2000 and $209million in April2001. The effect of the April2001 decrease for the rate year ended March31, 2002 was partially offset by recognition in income of $36million relating to rates for distributing electricity to customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and $50million (after tax) of deferred generation divestiture gain. Rates were also reduced, on an annual basis, effective September2001 by $313million to reflect the divestiture of the company's nuclear generating facility and the Roseton generating plant, which resulted in a reduction in operating and other expenses. See NoteJ.
Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, as amended by a July1998 PSC order, Con Edison of New York sold approximately 7,780 MW of the approximately 8,300 MW of generating capacity that it owned at the time the 1997 Restructuring Agreement was executed. See NoteJ.
In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that revised and extended the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000.
In general under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York's base electric transmission and distribution rates will not otherwise be changed during the five-year period ending March2005 except (i)with respect to certain changes in costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements, inflation in excess of a 4percent annual rate, property tax changes and environmental cost increases or (ii)if the PSC determines that circumstances have occurred that either 115 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED threaten the company's economic viability or ability to provide, safe and adequate service, or render the company's rate of return unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service.
Under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December2001, 35percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March2002 through 2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity will be retained for shareholders and the balance will be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. In 2002 and 2003, Con Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve of $49million for the rate year ending March2003. An electric shared earnings reserve has not been established for the rate year ending March2004 based on results through the end of calendar year 2003, and there was no sharing of earnings for the rate year ended March2002. The earnings threshold for rate years ending March2003 through March2005 of 11.75percent can be increased up to 50 basis points. The threshold will increase by 25 basis points if certain demand reductions and supply increases exceed targeted projections and by an additional 25 basis points if certain customer service and reliability objectives are achieved. The company could be required to pay up to $40million annually in penalties if certain threshold service and reliability objectives are not achieved. The company recorded penalties relating to reliability objectives of $8million and $3million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Con Edison of New York's potential electric strandable costs are utility investments and commitments that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market. The company is recovering these costs in the rates it charges all of its electric customers. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the stranded cost recovery provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, stating that Con Edison of New York "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments, under the parameters and during the time periods set forth therein." The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" below.
In 1997, the PSC approved a four-year O&R restructuring plan effective through December31, 2002, pursuant to which O&R sold all of its generating assets, made retail access available to all of its electric customers effective May1999 and reduced its electric rates by $32million through rate reductions implemented in December1997 and 1998. In 1998 and 1999, similar plans for O&R's utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were approved by state regulators. The Pennsylvania plan provided for retail access for all customers effective May1999. The New Jersey plan provided for retail access for all customers effective August1999 and rate reductions of $7million effective August1999, an additional reduction of $3million effective January2001 and a final reduction of $6million effective August2002.
In accordance with the April1999 PSC order approving Con Edison's acquisition of O&R, Con Edison of New York reduced its annual electric and gas rates by $12million and $2million, respectively, and O&R reduced its annual electric rates and gas rates by $6million and $1million, respectively.
116 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED In October2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covers the period from July1, 2003 through October31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11million (pre-tax) over the period covered by the agreement. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 12.75percent return on common equity during the three year period from July2003 through June2006. The period from July2006 through October2006 will not be subject to earnings sharing.
In July2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO), the New Jersey utility subsidiary of O&R, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7million decrease in RECO's electric base rates, effective August2003, authorized RECO's recovery of approximately $83million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19million of such costs and associated interest. At December31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for $13million of the disallowance, and at June30, 2003 reserved an additional $6million for the disallowance.
Gas In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000.
Under the 2000 agreement, the rate of return on gas common equity above which Con Edison of New York shared with customers 50percent of earnings was increased from 13percent to 14percent. In addition, customer bills were reduced by $20million during the January through March2001 period.
At December31, 2001, Con Edison of New York reserved $12million for customers' share of gas earnings in excess of the 14percent threshold for the rate year ended September2001. No additional amounts were reserved for the rate year ended September2002.
In April2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced gas rates, on an annualized basis, by $25million.
During the term of the 2002 agreement, Con Edison of New York retains 100percent of the rate year return on equity up to 11.5percent. If the return on equity is between 11.5percent and 12.0percent, 100percent of the incremental return over 11.5percent will be set aside for customer benefit. If the return on equity is above 12.0percent, 50percent of the incremental return over 12.0percent will be retained by shareholders, and the remaining 50percent will be shared with customers. Earnings on gas common equity did not exceed the specified rate of return for the rate year ended September30, 2003.
117 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The 2002 agreement also continued the retail access credit for firm transportation customers and other programs designed to increase customer and marketer participation in the gas retail access program, the net costs of which are to be recovered from customers.
In May2002, Con Edison of New York established a $36million reserve, funded by previously deferred customer credits, to recover unreimbursed costs directly related to the World Trade Center attack.
In November2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for gas service by $108million (9.8percent increase), effective October2004. The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of 12percent and an equity ratio of 49.3percent and assumes firm gas sales and transportation delivery volume increases of 0.8percent annually. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through September2007 provided charges would be adjusted, effective October2005 and October2006, to reflect inflation and changes in pension and health insurance expenses, property taxes, capital expenditures, environmental expenditures and certain other costs. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which energy costs are recovered from customers on a current basis and the effects of weather-related changes on net income are moderated.
In November2000, the PSC authorized implementation of a gas rate agreement between O&R, the PSC staff, and certain other parties covering the period November2000 through April2002. In October2001, the PSC approved an extension of this agreement covering the period May2002 through October2003. With limited exceptions, the agreement provided for no changes to base rates. O&R was permitted to retain, and amortized to income over the period November2000 through October2003, $18million of deferred credits that otherwise would have been credited to customers.
In October2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the PSC staff and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for gas service. The O&R gas agreement, which covers the period from November1, 2003 through October31, 2006, provides for increases in gas base rates of $9million (5.8percent) effective November2003, $9million (4.8percent) effective November2004 and $5million (2.5percent) effective November2005. The O&R gas agreement also continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11percent return on common equity. The agreement also contains incentives under which, among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer subscription to its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets for interruptible sales and transportation customers.
Steam In November2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that provided for a $17million steam rate increase in October2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004. The 118 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED company is required to share with customers 50percent of any earnings for any rate year covered by the agreement above a specified rate of return on steam common equity (11.0percent for the first rate year, the 12-month period ended September2001; 10.5percent thereafter if the repowering of its steam-electric generating plant is not completed). The net revenue effect associated with sales increases related to colder than normal winter weather (November through April) will be excluded from any earnings measurement. Earnings on steam common equity did not exceed the specific rates of return for the rate years ended September30, 2001, 2002 or 2003.
Under the steam rate agreement, upon completion of the project to add incremental generating capacity at the East River steam-electric generating plant, the net benefits of the project (including the net after-tax gain from the sale of a nine-acre development site in mid-town Manhattan along the East River) allocable to steam operations will inure to the benefit of steam customers. It is now expected that this project will not be completed until after the expiration of the current steam rate agreement. Con Edison of New York believes the same provisions would apply in the next rate agreement.
The agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased steam and fuel costs and requires Con Edison of New York to develop a strategy for hedging price variations for a portion of the steam produced each year.
In November2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for steam service by $129million (14.6percent increase), net of an estimated $64million of expected fuel savings associated with the ongoing East River Repowering Project, effective October2004. The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of 12percent and an equity ratio of 49.3percent. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through September2007 provided charges would be adjusted, effective October2005 and October2006, to reflect inflation and changes in pension and health insurance expenses, property taxes, capital expenditures, environmental expenditures and certain other costs. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers on a current basis.

Con Edison of New York owns $962million of Con Edison stock, which it purchased in 1998 and 1999 in connection with Con Edison's stock repurchase plan.
Capitalization of Con Edison The outstanding capitalization for each of the Companies is shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization, and for Con Edison includes the Utilities' outstanding preferred stock and debt.
Preferred Stock of Utility Subsidiaries As of December31, 2003, 1,915,319 shares of Con Edison of New York's $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "$5 Preferred") and 375,626 shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value) were outstanding.
Dividends on the $5 Preferred stock are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $4.65 per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred dividends must be declared by Con Edison of New York's Board of Trustees to become payable. See "Dividends" below.
With respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison (which owns all of the 235,488,094 shares of Con Edison of New York's common shares that are outstanding) and the holders of the $5 Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock have no right to vote; provided, however, that if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share with respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods, the holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the election of Con Edison of New York's Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, Con Edison of New York may not create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. Con Edison of New York may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $101 per share (in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends). In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the company's common stock, the holders of the $5 Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled to receive $100 per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case together with all accrued and unpaid dividends.
121 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities may pay are limited to not more than 100percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of "income available for dividends" are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiary's equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.
In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New York's common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.
Long-term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2004-2008 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R 2004 166 150 - 2005 467 450 - 2006 20 - - 2007 371 330 20 2008 504 280 - Long-term debt includes notes issued by O&R to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) for the net proceeds of NYSERDA's $55million aggregate principal amount of Series1994A and $44million aggregate principal amount of Series1995A Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds. The interest rate determination method for this debt is subject to change in accordance with the related indenture, and the debt currently bears interest at a weekly rate determined by its remarketing agent. The debt is subject to optional and, in certain circumstances, mandatory tender for purchase by O&R. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteP.
Long-term debt is stated at cost, which, as of December31, 2003, approximates fair value (estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities), except for $225million of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteP.
At December31, 2003, long-term debt includes $23million of mortgage bonds collateralized by substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of O&R's New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries, $141million of non-recourse debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a pledge of a New Jersey power plant, a related power purchase agreement and project assets, and $339million of debt secured by a New Hampshire power plant and related assets. See NoteT. At December31, 2003, restricted cash relating to the operations of the New Jersey power plant was $17million.
122 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison, Con Edison of New York or O&R, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. The arrangements for certain series of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing (Series1999A, 2001A and 2001B), aggregating $615million, and O&R's tax-exempt financing (Series1994A and Series1995A), aggregating $99million, include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. Additional series of Con Edison of New York tax-exempt financing issued in 2004 (Series2004A and 2004B), aggregating $245million, also include such covenants and provisions. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied might and, in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.
The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($100million for Con Edison of New York; $13million for O&R).
NoteD - Short Term Borrowing At December31, 2003, Con Edison and the Utilities had commercial paper programs under which short-term borrowings are made at prevailing market rates, totaling $950million. These programs are supported by revolving credit agreements with banks. At December31, 2003, $42million was outstanding under Con Edison's $350million program, $99million was outstanding under Con Edison of New York's $500million program, and $15million was outstanding under O&R's $100million program, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.0percent. The Utilities change the amount of their programs from time to time, subject to FERC-authorized limits of $1billion for Con Edison of New York and $150million for O&R.
123 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreements total $950million, of which $563million was renewed in November2003. The commitments may terminate upon a change of control of Con Edison, and borrowings under the agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio (calculated in accordance with the agreements) of debt to total capital of the borrower not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1. At December31, 2003, this ratio was 0.52 to 1 for Con Edison, 0.50 to 1 for Con Edison of New York and 0.46 to 1 for O&R. Borrowings under the agreements are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels. The fees charged the Companies for the revolving credit facilities and borrowings under the agreements reflect their respective credit ratings.
See NoteU for information about short-term borrowing between related parties, which the FERC has authorized.
NoteE - Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York and O&R and certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period. This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.71 and its rate agreements, O&R defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the current rate allowance for its New York operations.
Con Edison uses a measurement date of December31 for its pension plan.

The Companies use historical investment data as well as the plan's target asset class and investment management mix to determine the expected return on plan assets. This analysis incorporates such factors as real return, inflation, and expected investment manager performance for each broad asset class applicable to the plan. Historical plan performance and peer data are also reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
Expected Contributions Based on current estimates, the Companies are not required under funding regulations and laws to make any contributions to the pension plan during 2004. O&R and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries expect to make discretionary contributions of $22million and $2million, respectively, in 2004.
Plan Assets The asset allocation for the pension plans at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the target allocation for 2004, by asset category, are as follows: Target Allocation Plan Assets at December 31 ASSET CATEGORY 2004 2003 2002 2001 Equity Securities 65% 64% 54% 59% Debt Securities 30% 32% 42% 37% Real Estate 5% 4% 4% 4% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% Con Edison has established a pension trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.
127 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Pursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edison's Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) has general oversight responsibility for Con Edison's pension and other employee benefit plans. The plans' Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edison's chief executive, chief financial and chief accounting officers and others the Board of Directors may appoint in addition to or in place of the designated Named Fiduciaries.
The long-term investment objective for the pension trust is to maximize the total real return on trust assets while limiting risk, reflected in volatility of returns, to prudent levels. To that end, the investment strategy focuses on preserving and enhancing the value of assets in real terms over time through selection of investment managers within a framework that provides diversification between and among asset classes, investment styles, and managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2004 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2003.
Individual managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an ongoing basis, and reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a quarterly basis. A change in fund managers and/or rebalancing of the portfolio is undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries approve such changes, which are also reported to the Committee.
The Companies also offer a defined contribution savings plan that covers substantially all employees and made contributions to the plan as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison $ 18 $ 17 $ 17 Con Edison of New York $ 17 $ 16 $ 16 O&R $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 NoteF - Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses.
Con Edison of New York also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. O&R has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees.
128 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries are eligible to receive benefits under these programs. The company has reserved the right to amend or terminate these programs.
Investment plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for the Utilities. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.
For O&R, plan assets are used to pay benefits and expenses for participants who retired on or after January1, 1995. O&R pays benefits for other participants who retired prior to 1995. Plan assets include amounts owed by the plan trust to O&R of $1million in 2003 and 2002, and less than $1million in 2001.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.71, O&R defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and the current rate allowance for its Pennsylvania and New York operations.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost The components of the Utilities' net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Service cost $ 10 $ 10 $ 12 $ 8 $ 8 $ 11 $ 2 $ 2 $ 1 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 82 88 88 73 80 81 9 8 7 Expected return on plan assets (78 ) (80 ) (73 ) (74 ) (76 ) (70 ) (4 ) (4 ) (3 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 46 24 10 41 21 9 5 3 1 Amortization of prior service cost (16 ) - 1 (15 ) - 1 (1 ) - - Amortization of transition obligation 4 5 17 4 5 17 - - - NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ 48 $ 47 $ 55 $ 37 $ 38 $ 49 $ 11 $ 9 $ 6 Cost capitalized/deferred 18 14 13 11 9 11 7 5 2 Cost charged to operating expenses $ 30 $ 33 $ 42 $ 26 $ 29 $ 38 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 129 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Funded Status The funded status of the programs at December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,248 $ 1,351 $ 1,170 $ 1,116 $ 1,249 $ 1,076 $ 132 $ 102 $ 94 Service cost 10 10 12 8 8 10 2 2 2 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 82 88 88 73 80 81 9 8 7 Plan amendments - (306 ) - - (306 ) - - - - Net actuarial loss 99 178 149 89 151 144 10 27 5 Benefits paid and administrative expenses (91 ) (89 ) (82 ) (83 ) (82 ) (76 ) (8 ) (7 ) (6 ) Participant contributions 18 15 14 18 15 14 - - - Medicare prescription subsidy (128 ) - - (114 ) - - (14 ) - - BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR $ 1,238 $ 1,247 $ 1,351 $ 1,107 $ 1,115 $ 1,249 $ 131 $ 132 $ 102 CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 717 $ 804 $ 844 $ 674 $ 763 $ 805 $ 43 $ 41 $ 39 Actual return on plan assets 145 (61 ) (29 ) 143 (61 ) (29 ) 2 - - Employer contributions 46 45 56 38 39 50 8 6 6 Participant contributions 18 16 14 18 16 14 - - - Benefits paid (87 ) (82 ) (76 ) (83 ) (78 ) (72 ) (4 ) (4 ) (4 ) Administrative expenses - (5 ) (5 ) - (5 ) (5 ) - - - FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR $ 839 $ 717 $ 804 $ 790 $ 674 $ 763 $ 49 $ 43 $ 41 Funded status $ (399 ) $ (530 ) $ (547 ) $ (317 ) $ (441 ) $ (486 ) $ (82 ) $ (89 ) $ (61 ) Unrecognized net loss 363 506 211 319 455 189 44 51 22 Unrecognized prior service costs (133 ) (148 ) 8 (132 ) (147 ) 9 (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Unrecognized net transition liability at January1, 1993* 33 36 191 33 36 191 - - - ACCRUED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ (136 ) $ (136 ) $ (137 ) $ (97 ) $ (97 ) $ (97 ) $ (39 ) $ (39 ) $ (40 ) * Being amortized over a period of 20years and reduced by an additional amount in 2002 due to plan amendments.

The health care cost trend rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December31, 2003 was 9.00%. This rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% for 2009 and remain at 130 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate used to determine benefit obligations at December31, 2003 was 9.00%. This rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.50% for 2009 and remain at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects at December31, 2003: Con Edison of New York Con Edison O&R 1-Percentage-Point (Millions of Dollars) Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 128 $ 114 $ 115 $ 103 $ 13 $ 11 Effect on service cost and interest cost components for 2003 $ 11 $ 10 $ 10 $ 9 $ 1 $ 1 Expected Contributions Based on current estimates, Con Edison of New York and O&R expect to contribute $27million and $8million, respectively, to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2004.
Plan Assets The asset allocation for Con Edison of New York's other postretirement benefit plans at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the target allocation for 2004, by asset category, are as follows: Target Allocation Plan Assets at December 31 ASSET CATEGORY 2004 2003 2002 2001 Equity Securities 65% 62% 55% 58% Debt Securities 35% 38% 45% 42% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% The asset allocation for O&R's other postretirement benefit plans at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately 90% and 10% in debt and equity securities, respectively. The company plans to align its asset allocation to the target shown above.
Con Edison has established postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.
Refer to NoteE for a discussion of Con Edison's investment strategy.
Effect of Medicare Prescription Subsidy In December2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As permitted by the FASB, the Companies have elected not to defer recognition of this Act. See NoteV. To reflect the effect of the Act on the plans, the 2003year-end accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were reduced for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and O&R by $128million, $114million and $14million, respectively, and the 2004 after-tax postretirement benefit costs are estimated to be reduced by $10million for Con Edison, $9million for Con Edison 131 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED of New York and $1million for O&R. The Companies will recognize the 28% subsidy (reflected as an unrecognized net gain to each plan) as an offset to plan costs. The 28% subsidy is expected to reduce prescription drug plan costs by about 25%. The Companies' actuaries have determined that each prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20years. (For a small number of pension recipients, whose benefits total less than $12,000 per year, this will be the case indefinitely.) When the plans' benefits are no longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan, 25% of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the Companies' prescription programs. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and guidance, when issued, could require a change to previously reported information.
NoteG - Environmental Matters Superfund Sites Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs (which includes costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring) and environmental damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas sites, are referred to herein as "Superfund Sites." For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.
For the 12months ended December31, 2003, Con Edison of New York and O&R incurred approximately $21million and $5million, respectively, for environmental remediation costs. No insurance recoveries were received. For the 12months ended December31, 2002, Con Edison of New York and O&R incurred approximately $22million and $2million, respectively, for environmental remediation costs, and O&R received insurance recoveries of $7million.
132 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites for each of the Companies at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Accrued Liabilities: Manufactured gas plant sites $ 145 $ 110 $ 106 $ 76 $ 39 $ 34 Other Superfund Sites 48 33 47 32 1 1 Total $ 193 $ 143 $ 153 $ 108 $ 40 $ 35 Regulatory assets $ 155 $ 83 $ 116 $ 52 $ 39 $ 31 Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to Superfund Sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. As investigations progress on these and other sites, the Companies expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. The Utilities are permitted under their current rate agreements to recover or defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) certain site investigation and remediation costs.
Con Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that for its manufactured gas sites, many of which have not been investigated, its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range from approximately $65million to $1.1billion. O&R estimated in 2002 that for its manufactured gas sites the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range from approximately $25million to $95million. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at each of the sites and additional assumptions regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different.
Asbestos Proceedings Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars but the Companies believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through the disposition of previous claims. Con Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional such suits that may be brought over the next 50years ranges from approximately $38million to $162million (with no amount within the range considered more reasonable than any other). The estimate was based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different.
133 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED In addition, workers' compensation administrative proceedings have been commenced, wherein current and former employees claim benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos.
Con Edison of New York is permitted under its current rate agreements to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) liabilities incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers' compensation claims. O&R defers as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates), liabilities incurred for asbestos claims by employees relating to its divested generating plants.
The accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers' compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for each of the Companies at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Accrued liability - asbestos $ 39 $ 39 $ 38 $ 38 $ 1 $ 1 Regulatory assets - asbestos suits $ 39 $ 39 $ 38 $ 38 $ 1 $ 1 Accrued liability - workers' compensation $ 126 $ 130 $ 122 $ 125 $ 4 $ 5 Regulatory assets - workers' compensation $ 51 $ 54 $ 51 $ 54 $ - $ - NoteH - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Con Edison) In 2003, continuing adverse market conditions affecting Con Edison's unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock." For Con Edison Communications, it was determined that the book value of its assets were likely not fully recoverable. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.144, Con Edison Communications reduced its assets to their fair value by recording a pre-tax impairment charge of $140million. At the same time, $1million (pre-tax) of capitalized interest at Con Edison, which was related to the investment in Con Edison Communications, was deemed impaired. For Con Edison Development, the analysis resulted in a total pre-tax impairment charge of $18million related to two combustion turbines and its equity investment in a 42 MW electric generating plant in Guatemala. Estimated fair values were determined based upon market prices of comparable assets.
NoteI - Non-Utility Generators The Utilities have long-term contracts with non-utility generators (NUGs) for electric generating capacity. Assuming performance by the NUGs, the Utilities are obligated over the terms of the contracts (which extend for various periods, up to 2036) to make capacity and other fixed payments.
134 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED For the years 2004 through 2008, the capacity and other fixed payments under the contracts are estimated to be the following: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Con Edison $ 545 $ 529 $ 557 $ 579 $ 592 Con Edison of New York $ 530 $ 513 $ 552 $ 579 $ 592 O&R $ 15 $ 16 $ 5 $ - $ - Such payments gradually increase to approximately $650million in 2013, and thereafter decline significantly. For energy delivered under most of these contracts, the Utilities are obligated to pay variable prices that are estimated to be lower overall than expected market levels. In addition, for energy delivered under one of the contracts (for 20 MW), O&R is obligated to pay variable prices that are currently estimated to be above market levels.
At December31, 2003, the aggregate capacity produced under the NUG contracts was approximately 3,200 MW, including capacity (commitment ends 2005) from the approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating unit that Con Edison of New York sold in 2001. For energy from the unit, the company has a commitment (which ends in 2004) under which it is obligated to pay an average annual price of 3.9 cents per kWh. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned governmental authorities to close this plant. If this were to occur, the owner would not be obligated to provide the company with replacement power. Additionally, the contracts include 500 MW of energy and capacity that the company agreed to purchase annually for 10years from a plant in Queens County, New York that is scheduled to begin operation in 2006.
Under the terms of its electric rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is recovering in rates the charges it incurs under mandated contracts with NUGs. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that, after March31, 2005, Con Edison of New York will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers, the amount, if any, by which the actual costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market value. The PSC specifically approved rate recovery of the nuclear capacity and energy purchases. O&R recovers costs under its NUG contracts pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
NoteJ - Generation Divestiture Pursuant to restructuring agreements approved by the PSC (See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteB), the Utilities have divested all of their electric generating assets other than approximately 630 MW of Con Edison of New York's steam/electric generating stations located in New York City. Con Edison of New York sold approximately 6,300 MW of electric generating assets in 1999 and approximately 1,480 MW in 2001. O&R completed the sale of all of its generating assets prior to the completion of Con Edison's purchase of O&R in 1999.
Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the net after-tax gain (including interest accrued thereon) from Con Edison of New York's 1999 generation divestiture was applied in 2000 as follows: 135 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED $188million was credited against electric distribution plant balances; $107million was used to offset a like amount of regulatory assets (including deferred power contract termination costs); $50million (after-tax) was deferred for recognition in income during the 12months ended March31, 2002; and $12million was deferred to be used for low-income customer programs. In addition, $30million of employee retirement incentive expenses related to the generation divestiture was deferred for amortization over 15years and $15million of such expenses was charged to income in 2000.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides for Con Edison of New York to amortize to income a $74million regulatory asset representing incremental electric capacity costs incurred prior to May2000 to purchase capacity from the buyers of the generating assets the company sold in 1999. Amortization to income will take place in years in which the company would otherwise share excess earnings with customers, in amounts corresponding to the company's share of the excess earnings. By March2005, any remaining unrecovered balance will be charged to expense. Of this amount, $30million was charged to expense in 2002 and $15million was expensed in 2001.
In January2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its 480 MW interest in the jointly-owned Roseton generating station for $138million. The gain from the sale, which has been deferred as a regulatory liability, was $55million at December31, 2003, and $64million at December31, 2002. In September2001, the company completed the sale of its approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating plant and related assets for $505million. The proceeds were net of a $74million payment to increase the value of the nuclear decommissioning trust funds being transferred to $430million (the amount provided for in the sales agreement). The net after-tax loss from the sale was deferred as a regulatory asset. The company was authorized, effective September2001, to continue to recover the cost of the nuclear assets, which is included in rates, and to amortize the regulatory asset, until the loss on divestiture has been recovered. The unrecovered amount was $159million at December31, 2003 and $215million at December31, 2002. The 2000 Electric Agreement provides that the company "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments." NoteK - Leases Con Edison's subsidiaries lease electric generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No.13, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.
Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments 136 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED recovered through rates. The following assets and obligations under capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2003 and 2002: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 UTILITY PLANT Transmission $ 17 $ 12 $ 11 $ 12 Common 28 29 28 29 TOTAL $ 45 $ 41 $ 39 $ 41 CURRENT LIABILITIES $ 9 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 36 38 36 38 TOTAL LIABILITIES $ 45 $ 41 $ 39 $ 41 The accumulated amortization of the capital leases for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York was $32million and $29million as of December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The future minimum lease commitments for the above assets are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison Con Edison of New York 2004 $ 14 $ 8 2005 7 7 2006 7 7 2007 7 7 2008 8 8 All years thereafter 28 28 Total $ 71 $ 65 Less: amount representing interest 26 26 Present value of net minimum lease payment $ 45 $ 39 In November2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with a limited partnership to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire (Newington Project). See NoteT.
Operating leases: The future minimum lease commitments under Con Edison's non-cancelable operating lease agreements, excluding the Newington Project, are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R 2004 $ 51 $ 40 $ 3 2005 17 7 2 2006 16 6 2 2007 15 5 2 2008 15 5 2 All years thereafter 48 19 17 Total $ 162 $ 82 $ 28 137 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED As part of a broad initiative, the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing certain categories of transactions. Among these are transactions in which a taxpayer leases property and then immediately subleases it back to the lessor (termed "Lease In/Lease Out," or LILO transactions). In 1997 and 1999, Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries invested $93million in two LILO transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, which represented approximately 36percent of the purchase price; the remaining 64percent or $166million was furnished by third-party financing in the form of long-term debt that provides no recourse against the subsidiaries and is primarily secured by the assets, except for guarantees of up to $10million of the debt. Approximately half of these guarantees expired prior to December31, 2002 and the other half will expire at the end of May2004. At December31, 2003, the company's investment of $202million in these leveraged leases net of deferred tax liabilities of $142million amounted to $60million, which was included at cost on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet. On audit, the Internal Revenue Service has proposed that the tax losses recognized in connection with the 1997 LILO transaction be disallowed for the tax year 1997. Con Edison believes its position is correct and is currently appealing the auditors' proposal within the Internal Revenue Service. The estimated total tax savings from the two LILO transactions during the tax years 1997 through 2003, in the aggregate, was $100million.
NoteL - Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Con Edison) On January1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No.142 provides that goodwill (i.e., the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of a business acquired) and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their finite useful lives.
In 2002, the company recognized a loss of $34million ($20million after-tax) as an offset to goodwill recorded by Con Edison Development relating to certain of its generation assets.
During 2003, Con Edison completed the impairment test for its goodwill of $406million and determined that it was not impaired.
138 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Had Con Edison been accounting for goodwill under SFAS No.142 for all periods presented, its income and earnings per share would have been as follows: For the years ended December31, (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts) 2003 2002 2001 Net income for common stock As reported $ 528 $ 646 $ 682 Add back: goodwill amortization (net of tax) - - 11 Adjusted $ 528 $ 646 $ 693 Basic earnings per share As reported $ 2.39 $ 3.03 $ 3.22 Add back: goodwill amortization (net of tax) - - .05 Adjusted $ 2.39 $ 3.03 $ 3.27 Diluted earnings per share As reported $ 2.38 $ 3.02 $ 3.21 Add back: goodwill amortization (net of tax) - - .05 Adjusted $ 2.38 $ 3.02 $ 3.26 Con Edison's intangible assets consist of the following: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Power purchase agreement of an unregulated subsidiary $ 112 $ 3 $ 109 $ 92 $ 10 $ 82 Other 3 1 2 - - - Total $ 115 $ 4 $ 111 $ 92 $ 10 $ 82 The power purchase agreement was written up to its fair value of $112million upon implementation of new FASB guidance on derivatives (Derivatives Implementation Group Issue C20), and is being amortized over its remaining useful life of 11years. See NoteV.
139 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The amortization expense was $6million and $4million for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 respectively, and is expected to be $10million annually for the years 2004-2008.

Generally options vest three years after the grant date and expire 10years from the grant date.
As permitted by SFAS No.123, the Companies elected to follow APB No.25 and related interpretations in accounting for their employee stock options. Under the intrinsic value method of APB No.25, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of Con Edison's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Under the Plan, exercise of Con Edison's employee stock options requires payment in full of the exercise price, unless the committee of Con Edison's Board of Directors that administers the Plan determines that options may be settled by paying to the option holder the difference between the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and the exercise price (cash settlement). In 2002, to ensure that the exercise of currently exercisable options would comply with certain technical requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to certain officers of the Companies, the committee determined that 1996 and 1997 stock options covering 295,500 shares of common stock held by those officers may be settled by the cash settlement method. Charges to expense are recognized with respect to these options to the extent the fair market value of the common shares changes.
The following table summarizes the expense recognized in relation to the stock options subject to cash settlement: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Compensation expense - stock options $ - $ 4 $ - $ - $ 3 $ - $ - $ - $ - 145 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Disclosure of pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No.123. See "Stock-Based Compensation" in NoteA for an illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Companies had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to their stock-based employee compensation. The fair values of options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 are $4.30, $6.37 and $5.23 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Risk-free interest rate 3.35% 5.08% 5.22% Expected life 6 years 6 years 8 years Expected stock volatility 21.44% 21.43% 21.32% Expected dividend yield 5.66% 5.22% 5.83% A summary of changes in the status of stock options awarded to officers and employees of the Companies as of December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at 12/31/00 4,790,913 $ 37.749 4,485,113 $ 37.682 73,000 $ 32.500 Granted 1,487,050 37.758 1,287,550 37.760 101,000 37.750 Exercised (363,013 ) 29.740 (363,013 ) 29.740 - - Forfeited (160,300 ) 41.333 (63,200 ) 41.414 - - Outstanding at 12/31/01 5,754,650 38.157 5,346,450 38.215 174,000 35.547 Granted 1,584,350 42.510 1,349,850 42.510 113,000 42.510 Exercised (413,899 ) 30.813 (413,199 ) 30.793 - - Forfeited (127,450 ) 44.103 (116,950 ) 44.491 (2,000 ) 35.125 Outstanding at 12/31/02 6,797,651 39.506 6,166,151 39.532 285,000 38.311 Granted 1,621,700 39.639 1,346,700 39.704 113,000 39.505 Exercised (692,175 ) 32.728 (660,425 ) 32.705 (9,500 ) 32.500 Forfeited (110,000 ) 45.365 (99,000 ) 45.764 - - Outstanding at 12/31/03 7,617,176 $ 40.065 6,753,426 $ 40.142 388,500 $ 38.800 146 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at December31, 2003 for each plan year for the Companies: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R Plan Year Remaining Contractual Life Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable 2003 9 1,619,700 $ 39.640 - 1,346,700 $ 39.704 - 113,000 $ 39.505 - 2002 8 1,573,850 42.510 - 1,340,350 42.510 - 113,000 42.510 - 2001 7 1,465,350 37.758 - 1,272,850 37.760 - 100,000 37.750 - 2000 6 909,200 32.499 909,200 798,700 32.499 798,700 62,500 32.500 62,500 1999 5 1,076,600 47.868 1,076,600 1,028,900 47.865 1,028,900 - - - 1998 4 667,200 42.563 667,200 660,650 42.563 660,650 - - - 1997 3 208,676 31.500 208,676 208,676 31.500 208,676 - - - 1996 2 96,600 27.875 96,600 96,600 27.875 96,600 - - - Total 7,617,176 2,958,276 6,753,426 2,793,526 388,500 62,500 Pursuant to employment agreements, effective September2000, certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries were granted an aggregate of 350,000 restricted stock units, subject to the officers meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. In June2002, an additional 150,000 restricted stock units were granted to certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries under similar terms. The units, each of which represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock and related dividends, vest ratably through August2005 or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for the units over the vesting period.

NoteO - Financial Information By Business Segment The business segments of each of the Companies were determined based on similarities in economic characteristics, the regulatory environment, and management's reporting requirements.
Con Edison's principal business segments are Con Edison of New York's regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&R's regulated electric and gas utility activities and other operations, Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries and other (parent holding company interest and other expenses and consolidation adjustments). Con Edison of New York's principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. O&R's principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility activities and other operations.
All revenues of these business segments, excluding revenues earned by Con Edison Development on certain energy infrastructure projects, which are deemed to be immaterial, are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments, excluding certain investments in energy infrastructure projects by Con Edison Development ($216million at December31, 2003), are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in NoteA to the financial statements of this report.
Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.
148 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The financial data for the business segments are as follows: For the 12 Months Ended December 31, 2003 Operating revenues Inter- segment revenues Depreciation and amortization Income tax expense Operating income Interest charges Changesin accounting principles Total assets Construction expenditures (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison of New York Electric $ 6,334 $ 11 $ 367 $ 301 $ 758 $ 292 $ - $ 13,675 $ 829 Gas 1,295 3 72 66 149 60 - 2,918 181 Steam 537 2 19 5 35 24 - 1,171 158 Total Con Edison of New York $ 8,166 $ 16 $ 458 $ 372 $ 942 $ 376 $ - $ 17,764 $ 1,168 O&R Electric $ 530 $ - $ 26 $ 26 $ 52 $ 14 $ - $ 906 $ 53 Gas 197 - 8 8 16 7 - 361 18 Other - - - - - - - 2 - Total O&R $ 727 $ - $ 34 $ 34 $ 68 $ 21 $ - $ 1,269 $ 71 Unregulated subsidiaries $ 931 $ - $ 37 $ (69 ) $ (88 ) $ 14 $ 3 $ 1,554 $ 105 Other 3 (16 ) - (12 ) 12 23 - 379 - Total Con Edison $ 9,827 $ - $ 529 $ 325 $ 934 $ 434 $ 3 $ 20,966 $ 1,344 For the 12 Months Ended December 31, 2002 Operating revenues Inter- segment revenues Depreciation and amortization Income tax expense Operating income Interest charges Changesin accounting principles Total assets Construction expenditures (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison of New York Electric $ 5,775 $ 9 $ 352 $ 298 $ 759 $ 304 $ - $ 13,084 $ 825 Gas 1,045 3 68 61 159 63 - 2,718 186 Steam 404 2 18 (5 ) 36 25 - 1,035 84 Total Con Edison of New York $ 7,224 $ 14 $ 438 $ 354 $ 954 $ 392 $ - $ 16,837 $ 1,095 O&R Electric $ 476 $ - $ 26 $ 20 $ 58 $ 20 $ - $ 880 $ 41 Gas 159 - 8 5 14 8 - 318 17 Other - - - - - - - 3 - Total O&R $ 635 $ - $ 34 $ 25 $ 72 $ 28 $ - $ 1,201 $ 58 Unregulated subsidiaries $ 643 $ - $ 23 $ 19 $ 34 $ 16 $ (22 ) $ 1,319 $ 282 Other - (14 ) - - - 6 - 310 - Total Con Edison $ 8,502 $ - $ 495 $ 398 $ 1,060 $ 442 $ (22 ) $ 19,667 $ 1,435 149 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED For the 12 Months Ended December 31, 2001 Operating revenues Inter- segment revenues Depreciation and amortization Income tax expense Operating income Interest charges Changes in accounting principles Total assets Construction expenditures (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison of New York Electric $ 6,350 $ 12 $ 383 $ 359 $ 852 $ 301 $ - $ 11,356 $ 766 Gas 1,268 3 64 70 167 63 - 2,416 153 Steam 504 2 18 6 28 21 - 747 65 Total Con Edison of New York $ 8,122 $ 17 $ 465 $ 435 $ 1,047 $ 385 $ - $ 14,519 $ 984 O&R Electric $ 538 $ - $ 25 $ 23 $ 50 $ 16 $ - $ 837 $ 41 Gas 198 - 8 3 13 8 - 295 18 Other - - - - - - - 3 - Total O&R $ 736 $ - $ 33 $ 26 $ 63 $ 24 $ - $ 1,135 $ 59 Unregulated subsidiaries $ 531 $ - $ 17 $ 4 $ 30 $ 17 $ - $ 1,017 $ 154 Other - (17 ) 11 - (12 ) 5 - 363 - Total Con Edison $ 9,389 $ - $ 526 $ 465 $ 1,128 $ 431 $ - $ 17,034 $ 1,197 NoteP - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Effective January2001, the Companies adopted SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended (SFAS No.133). Under SFAS No.133, derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard. Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value under SFAS No.133.
Energy Price Hedging Con Edison's subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. The fair values of these hedges at December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Fair value of net assets $ 27 $ 39 $ 15 $ 16 $ 5 $ 1 Cash Flow Hedges Con Edison's subsidiaries designate a portion of derivative instruments held for purposes other than trading as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133. Under cash flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be "effective," the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be "ineffective" is recognized in earnings in the period in which such determination is made.
150 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED For the Companies, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for energy transactions, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: TwelveMonthsEndedDecember31, ConEdison ConEdisonof NewYork O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as cash flow hedges, net of taxes $ 11 $ 28 $ (1 ) $ 4 $ - $ - Less: Reclassification adjustment of gains/(losses) included in net income, net of taxes 20 2 (1 ) 1 - - Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as cash flow hedges for the period $ (9 ) $ 26 $ - $ 3 $ - $ - The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in accumulated OCI at December31, 2003: AccumulatedOther ComprehensiveIncome/(Loss) NetofTax PortionExpectedtobeReclassified toEarningsduringtheNext12 Months (Millionsof Dollars/Term inMonths) Maximum Term Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork O&R Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork O&R Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork O&R Energy Price Hedges 33 8 12 $ 5 $ - $ - $ 4 $ - $ - The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices. The effect of reclassification from accumulated OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transaction in earnings.
For the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Companies recognized in net earnings unrealized pre-tax net gains and losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges as follows: TwelveMonthsEndedDecember31, Con Edison ConEdisonof NewYork O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Unrealized gains/(losses) on ineffective portion of derivatives qualified as hedges $ (1 ) $ 2 $ - $ - $ - $ - Other Derivatives Con Edison of New York enters into certain non-trading derivative instruments, some of which are on behalf of O&R, that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities, with limited exceptions, recover all gains and losses on these instruments. See 151 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA. Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Energy also enter into certain other contracts that are derivatives, but do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.133. Changes in the fair market value of these derivative contracts are recorded in earnings in the reporting period in which they occur. In the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Companies recognized in earnings unrealized pre-tax net gains and losses relating to these hedges as follows: Twelve Months Ended December31, Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Unrealized gains/(losses) $ - $ 4 $ - $ - $ - $ - Energy Trading Activities Con Edison Energy engages in energy-trading activities. Con Edison Energy makes wholesale purchases and sales of electric, gas and related energy trading products and provides risk management services to other unregulated Con Edison subsidiaries in order to optimize the value of their electric generating facilities and retail supply contracts. It also engages in a limited number of other wholesale commodity transactions. Con Edison Energy utilizes forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and capacity, over-the-counter swap contracts, exchange-traded natural gas and crude oil futures and options, transmission congestion contracts and other physical and financial contracts. As of December31, 2003, these contracts had terms of three years or less and their fair value was $4million as of December31, 2003 and $5million as of December31, 2002. Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries recognized in earnings pre-tax net losses relating to energy trading contracts of $3million and $1million, including the amortization of premiums paid and received, and excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Effective October1, 2002, all derivative energy-trading contracts are reported at fair value, with corresponding changes in value recognized immediately in earnings in accordance with SFAS No.133 and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." Prior to October2002, energy-trading contracts were accounted for under EITF Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," which was rescinded in October of 2002. As a result, previously recognized mark-to-market gains and losses on non-derivative contracts were reversed. Con Edison reported a $2million after-tax loss for the effect of the rescission as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
152 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Interest Rate Hedging Con Edison's subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The fair values of these interest rate swaps at December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Fair value of interest rate swaps $ (23 ) $ (23 ) $ 1 $ 6 $ (17 ) $ (19 ) Con Edison of New York's swap (related to $225million of tax-exempt debt) is designated as a fair value hedge, which qualifies for "short-cut" hedge accounting under SFAS No.133. Under this method, changes in fair value of the swap are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings.
Con Edison Development and O&R's swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges are as follows: Debt Maturity Date Notional Amount (Millions of Dollars) Fixed Rate Paid Variable Rate Received O&R Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bond, 1994 Series A 2014 $ 55 6.09 % Current bond rate Con Edison Development Amortizing variable rate loans - Lakewood 2008 $ 67 6.68 % LIBOR Unrealized gains and losses on these cash flow hedges, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Con Edison O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2003 2002 Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges, net of taxes $ 2 $ (9 ) $ 3 $ (4 ) Less: Reclassification adjustment for gains/(losses) included in net income, net of taxes (1 ) (4 ) 1 (1 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges for the period $ 3 $ (5 ) $ 2 $ (3 ) 149 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in the accumulated OCI at December31, 2003: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Net of Tax Portion Expected to be Reclassified to Earnings during the Next 12 Months (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison O&R Con Edison O&R Interest Rate Swaps $ (14 ) $ (10 ) $ (3 ) $ (1 ) The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in interest rates. The effect of reclassification from accumulated OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transaction in earnings. The reclassification to earnings has no impact on O&R's results of operations because these costs are currently recovered in O&R's rates.
NoteQ - Northeast Utilities Litigation (Con Edison) In March2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entitled Consolidated Edison,Inc. v. Northeast Utilities (the First Federal Proceeding), seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edison's obligation to complete its acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January11, 2000 (the merger agreement). In May2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As amended, Con Edison's complaint seeks, among other things, recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, the court's declaration that under the merger agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to Northeast Utilities and that Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison.
In June2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim to the First Federal Proceeding its claim that Con Edison materially breached the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the consideration to be paid to Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock, expenditures in connection with regulatory approvals and lost business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $26.00 per share (an estimated aggregate of not more than $3.9billion) plus $0.0034 per share for each day after August5, 2000 through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50percent in cash and 50percent in stock.
In March2003, the court ruled on certain motions filed by Con Edison and Northeast Utilities in the First Federal Proceeding. The court ruled that Con Edison's claim against Northeast Utilities for hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of the merger agreement, as well as Con Edison's claim that Northeast Utilities underwent a material adverse change, will go to trial. The court also dismissed Con 150 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Edison's fraud and misrepresentation claims. In addition, the court ruled that Northeast Utilities' claims on behalf of its shareholders against Con Edison for damages in excess of $1.2billion will go to trial. The court has not yet ruled on subsequent motions by both parties regarding evidence to be presented at trial.
In May2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities' shareholders, entitled Rimkoski, et al. v. Consolidated Edison,Inc., was filed in New York County Supreme Court (the State Proceeding) alleging breach of the merger agreement. The complaint defines the putative class as holders of Northeast Utilities' common stock on March5, 2001, and alleges that the class members were intended third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement. The complaint seeks damages believed to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities on behalf of its shareholders in the First Federal Proceeding. In December2003, the court granted the State Proceeding plaintiffs' motion to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding and in February2004, the State Proceeding was dismissed without prejudice. In January2004, Rimkoski filed a motion to certify his action as a class action on behalf of all holders of Northeast Utilities' common stock on March5, 2000 and to appoint Rimkoski as class representative. Northeast Utilities has opposed the motion.
In October2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities' shareholders, entitled Siegel et al. v. Consolidated Edison,Inc., was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Second Federal Proceeding). The putative class in the Second Federal Proceeding is the same putative class as in the State Proceeding. The amended complaint in the Second Federal Proceeding seeks unspecified injunctive relief and damages believed to be substantially duplicative of the damages sought from Con Edison in the First Federal Proceeding and in the State Proceeding. In January2004, both Con Edison and Northeast Utilities (which has sought to intervene in the Second Federal Proceeding) moved to dismiss the Second Federal Proceeding and the plaintiffs in the Second Federal Proceeding moved to consolidate that proceeding with the First Federal Proceeding.
Con Edison believes that Northeast Utilities materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con Edison did not materially breach the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it was not obligated to acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities did not meet the merger agreement's conditions that Northeast Utilities perform all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Those obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement were true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect to Northeast Utilities.
Con Edison is unable to predict whether or not any Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edison's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
NoteR - Lower Manhattan Restoration (Con Edison and Con Edison of New York) Con Edison of New York estimates that it will incur $430million of costs for emergency response to the September11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and for resulting temporary and subsequent 151 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED permanent restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged in the attack. Most of the costs are expected to be capital in nature. In December2001, the company filed a petition with the PSC for authorization to defer the costs. The company estimates that $90million of the costs will be covered by insurance. It expects the PSC to permit recovery from customers of the costs, net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings. In August2002, Congress appropriated funds for which the company is eligible to apply to recover costs it incurred in connection with the attack. In accordance with the procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, the company submitted its initial application for funds in October2003 and received the first installment of $29million on October31, 2003. The company will submit additional applications when appropriate. At December31, 2003, the company had capitalized $186million of such costs as utility plant and deferred $68million, including interest, as a regulatory asset.
In addition, based upon New York City's announced plans for improvement projects in lower Manhattan, including a transportation hub, the company anticipates that over the next five to ten years it may incur up to $250million in incremental costs in lower Manhattan. The company expects that it would recover any such costs from customers through the utility ratemaking process.
NoteS - Guarantees (Con Edison) In November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees, a guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability. FIN 45 contains exclusions to this requirement, including the exclusion of a parent's guarantee of its subsidiaries' debt to a third party. FIN 45 is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has issued guarantees on behalf of entities in which it has an equity interest. Con Edison's guarantees had maximum limits totaling $1billion at December31, 2003 and 2002, as to which underlying guaranteed obligations of $320million and $588million, respectively, were outstanding.
The following table summarizes, by type and term, the total maximum amount of guarantees: Maximum Amount Guarantee Type 0-3 years 4-10 years > 10 years Total (Millions of Dollars) Commodity transactions $ 690 $ 35 $ 162 $ 887 Affordable housing program - 49 - 49 Intra-company guarantees 5 - 51 56 Other guarantees 38 11 16 65 TOTAL $ 733 $ 95 $ 229 $ 1,057 152 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Commodity Transactions Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Affordable Housing Program Con Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with respect to the debt relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue No.94-01, "Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects," neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet.
Intra-company Guarantees  $50million relates to a guarantee issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Communications to Con Edison of New York for payment relating to the use of space in the latter's facilities and the construction of new telecommunications underground facilities.
$6million relates to commodity guarantees issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to Rockland Electric and Con Edison of New York, respectively.
Other Guarantees Con Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following:  $21million for guarantees, standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration projects;  $7million for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities;  $12million for certain rent payment obligations of Con Edison's subsidiaries under various lease agreements for office buildings;  $25million for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solution's indemnity agreement for surety bonds.
NoteT - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (Con Edison) In December2003, the FASB issued a revised Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46), which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE's) by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE.
153 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED FIN 46 is effective no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim period that ends after March15, 2004. However, as it relates to special-purpose entities, FIN 46 is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year or interim period that ends after December15, 2003. Earlier application is permitted. In accordance with FIN 46, in December2003, Con Edison consolidated the Newington Project and a Con Edison Solutions' project, which are described in the following paragraphs.
In November2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with Hawkeye L.P. (Lessor) to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire. In accordance with SFAS No.13, and related EITF issues (including EITF Issue No.90-15, "Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees, and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" and EITF Issue No.97-10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction"), the Newington Project and the related obligations were not included on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet prior to December2003.
At the expiration of the initial lease term in June2010, the Con Edison Development subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the project for the then outstanding amounts expended by the Lessor for the project. In the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the project, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value of the Newington Project for an amount not to exceed $239.7million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the Lessor if an event of default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the Lessor's investment in the Newington Project plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value guarantee. The subsidiary's payment and performance obligations relating to the Newington Project are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison.
Future minimum rental payments under the Newington Project operating lease are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2004 $ 33 2005 33 2006 33 2007 33 2008 33 All years thereafter 51 Total $ 216 At December31, 2003, Con Edison included $339million of assets related to the Newington Project and $344million of long-term debt and other liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, Con Edison recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle after-tax charge of $5million.
Substantial completion on the Newington project occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The subsidiary and the construction contractor for this plant have initiated legal proceedings with respect to whether the 154 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED subsidiary is entitled to damages for a delay in completion of this plant and whether the contractor is entitled to additional project costs. Con Edison does not expect that this dispute will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In 2001, Con Edison Solutions formed a partnership to own and operate a cogeneration facility that was accounted for under the equity method. The plant became fully operational in early 2002. Upon the adoption of FIN 46, Con Edison Solutions included $2million of the cogeneration facility's assets and the related debt on its consolidated balance sheet with no earnings impact.
Con Edison Development has a sole limited interest in an affordable housing partnership which began in August2000. Under FIN 46, the partnership was determined to be a VIE where Con Edison Development is not the primary beneficiary. The partnership was established to acquire economic interests in residential housing rental properties expected to qualify for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. At December31, 2003, Con Edison Development's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE was $7million. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the amounts of the debt undertaken by the partnership. See NoteS.
NoteU - Related Party Transactions The Utilities and Con Edison's other subsidiaries provide administrative and other services to each other pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the PSC. For O&R the services received include substantially all administrative support operations, such as corporate directorship and associated ministerial duties, accounting, treasury, investor relations, information resources, legal, human resources, fuel supply and energy management services. The costs of administrative and other services provided by, and received from, Con Edison and its subsidiaries for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Con Edison of New York O&R (Millions of Dollars) 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Cost of services provided $ 37 $ 31 $ 40 $ 13 $ 12 $ 11 Cost of services received $ 25 $ 24 $ 24 $ 20 $ 15 $ 14 In addition, O&R purchased from Con Edison of New York $128million, $102million and $141million of natural gas for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. O&R purchased from Con Edison of New York $16million and $25million of electricity for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. O&R also purchased from Con Edison Energy $1million of electricity for the year ended December31, 2003.
In December2003, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to O&R, for periods of not more than 12months, in amounts not to exceed $150million outstanding at any time, at prevailing market rates. O&R has not borrowed any funds from Con Edison of New York.
155 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED NoteV - New Financial Accounting Standards In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46). For discussion of FIN 46, see NoteT.
In January2003, the Companies adopted SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." See "Plant and DepreciationUtility Plant" in NoteA.
SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which was effective in January 2003, requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In June2003, the FASB issued final guidance on the use of broad market indices in power purchase and sale contracts (Derivatives Implementation Group Issue C20). In particular, this guidance clarifies whether the pricing in a contract that contains broad market indices (e.g., consumer price index) could qualify as a normal purchase or normal sale scope exception and therefore not be subject to fair value accounting under SFAS No.133. The guidance became effective in the fourth quarter of 2003. Upon implementation of this guidance, Con Edison recognized to fair value certain power sales contracts at Con Edison Development. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an increase to net income of $8million.
In June2003, the Companies adopted SFAS No.149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, and SFAS No.150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," which revises and expands the definition of a liability (FASB Concept Statement No.5, "Elements of Financial Statements") and provides accounting and reporting guidance. Effective July1, 2003, the Companies adopted EITF 01-8, " Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease." The adoption of SFAS No.149, SFAS No.150 and EITF 01-8, had no material impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In August2003, the EITF reached a consensus that realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not "held for trading purposes" should be reported on a net or gross basis based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the contract .
In analyzing these facts and circumstances, Issue 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent," should be applied. The EITF consensus is effective for new transactions or arrangements entered into beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003. The adoption of this EITF consensus had no material impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In January2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS106-1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." The FSP gives plan sponsors an option to defer recognizing the effects of the Act in the accounting for its plan under FASB Statement No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 156 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Benefits Other Than Pensions," and in providing disclosures required by FASB Statement No.132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," until authoritative guidance is issued, or until certain other events (such as plan amendments) occur. Con Edison has elected not to defer the recognition of the Act. See NoteF.
NoteW - East 11 th Street Accident In January2004, a woman died when she came into contact with the metal frame of a Con Edison of New York service box that had been installed in a New York City street. The frame was energized by a low voltage cable that in January2003 was repaired by the company in a manner that varied from its written procedures. Following this accident, the company began "stray-voltage" inspection testing of its transformer vaults, manholes and service boxes in the portion of its service area in which its distribution facilities are underground. The company also tested certain of the City's Department of Transportation's street lights. The company has substantially completed this testing and has eliminated stray voltage conditions at the few locations tested where there was measurable voltage. The company has committed to add this testing to its annual inspection programs.
In February2004, the PSC instituted a proceeding as to whether Con Edison of New York violated the safety requirements of the New York Public Service Law and ordered the company to show cause why the PSC should not commence an action seeking penalties from the company. The PSC also instituted a proceeding to examine the safety of the company's electric transmission and distribution systems and ordered the company to complete testing for stray voltage and any necessary repair of additional equipment in the company's service area.
Con Edison of New York believes that its utility systems are safe and reliable. The company, however, is unable to predict whether or not any proceedings or other actions relating to this accident will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
