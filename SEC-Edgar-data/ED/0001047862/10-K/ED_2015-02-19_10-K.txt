Con Edisons mission is to provide energy services to our customers safely, reliably, efficiently and in an environmentally sound manner; to provide a workplace that allows employees to realize their full potential; to provide a fair return to our investors; and to improve the quality of life in the communities we serve.
Con Edison is a holding company that owns:  CECONY, which delivers electricity, natural gas and steam to customers in New York City and Westchester County;  O&R (together with CECONY referred to as the Utilities), which delivers electricity and natural gas to customers primarily located in southeastern New York, and northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania;  Competitive energy businesses, which sell to retail customers electricity purchased in wholesale markets and enter into related hedging transactions; provide energy-related products and services to wholesale and retail customers, and develop, own and operate renewable and energy infrastructure projects; and  Consolidated Edison Transmission, LLC (Con Edison Transmission), which was formed in 2014 to invest in a transmission company.
Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities, which are subject to extensive regulation, will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities have approved rate plans that are generally designed to cover each companys cost of service, including the capital and other costs of the companys energy delivery systems. The Utilities recover from their full-service customers (generally, on a current basis) the cost the Utilities pay for the energy and charge all of their customers the cost of delivery service.

Significant 2014 Developments and Outlook  Con Edison reported 2014 net income of $1,092 million or $3.73 a share compared with $1,062 million or $3.62 a share in 2013. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude the effects of the gain on sale of solar electric production projects, the LILO transactions (see Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item8) and the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses, were $1,140 million or $3.89 a share in 2014 compared with $1,112 million or $3.80 a share in 2013. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure below. The results of operations reflect changes in the Utilities rate plans, the cold weather benefit to steam revenues, increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, and the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses. See Results of Operations in Item7.
CECONY delivered 56,303million kWhs of electricity (1.1percent decrease from prior year), 154,859 MDt of gas (11.4 percent increase from prior year) and 23,016MMlb of steam to its customers (5.0 percent increase from prior year). O&R delivered 5,669million kWhs of electricity (0.9 percent decrease from prior year) and 26,337 MDt of gas (5.4 percent increase from prior year). CECONY and O&Rs New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms pursuant to which delivery revenues are not generally affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed in the rate plans. See Results of Operations in Item7.
CECONY forecasts average annual growth in peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years for electric and gas to be approximately 0.9percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, and average annual decrease in steam peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.8 percent. O&R forecasts average annual growth of the peak demand in its service area over the next five years at design conditions for electric and gas to be approximately 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. See The Utilities in Item1.
In 2014, the Utilities invested $2,274 million to upgrade and reinforce their energy delivery systems and the competitive energy businesses invested $447 million primarily in solar electric production projects. In 2015, the Companies are expected to invest $2,912 million for their energy delivery systems and renewable electric production projects. The Companies expect to meet their 2015 capital requirements, including maturing securities, through internally-generated funds and the issuance of between $1,000 million and $1,500 million of long-term debt. Con Edison does not expect to need to issue common equity in 2015 other than through its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and long term incentive plans. See Capital Requirements and Resources in Item1.
In March 2014, an explosion and fire destroyed two buildings to which CECONY had provided gas service. Eight people died and more than 48 people were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board and the NewYork State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) are investigating. See Note H to the financial statements in Item8.
In 2014, the NYSPSC adopted a Joint Proposal with respect to CECONYs rates for electric, gas and steam delivery service in 2014 and 2015 (and gas and steam delivery service in 2016); the NYSPSC initiated its Reforming the Energy Vision proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy and distributed energy resources and empower customer choice; the NYSPSC initiated a proceeding to investigate the practices of qualifying persons to perform plastic fusions on gas facilities; and O&R filed requests with the NYSPSC for an electric rate increase of $33.4million and a gas rate increase of $40.7 million, CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 7 Table of Contents effective November 2015. See Utility Regulation in Item1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item8.
In January 2015, CECONY filed a request with the NYSPSC for an electric rate increase of $368 million, effective January 2016. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 10 percent and a common equity ratio of approximately 48 percent. See Rate Plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item8.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure Earnings from ongoing operations is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States of America (GAAP). Earnings from ongoing operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to facilitate the analysis of the companys ongoing performance and believes that this non-GAAP measure also is useful and meaningful to investors. The following table is a reconciliation of Con Edisons reported net income to earnings from ongoing operations and reported earnings per share to earnings per share from ongoing operations.

10 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents PART I Item1: Business Overview Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and the competitive energy businesses. In addition, in 2014 Con Edison formed Consolidated Edison Transmission LLC (Con Edison Transmission) to invest in a transmission company. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and CECONY.
Con Edisons principal business operations are those of CECONY, O&R and the Competitive Energy Businesses. CECONYs principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&Rs principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. The competitive energy businesses sell electricity to retail customers, provide energy-related products and services, and develop, own and operate renewable and energy infrastructure projects.
Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. The company invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe, and clean energy critical for New York Citys growing economy. The company is an industry leading owner and operator of contracted, large-scale solar generation in the U.S. Con Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable.
CECONY Electric CECONY provides electric service to approximately 3.4million customers in all of New York City (except a part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million.
Gas CECONY delivers gas to approximately 1.1million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and most of Westchester County.
Steam CECONY operates the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering approximately 23,000 MMlb of steam annually to approximately 1,700 customers in parts of Manhattan.
O&R Electric O&R and its utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) and Pike County Light& Power Company (Pike) (together referred to herein as O&R) provide electric service to approximately 0.3million customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania, an approximately 1,350 square mile service area.
Gas O&R delivers gas to over 0.1million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northeastern Pennsylvania.
Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edison pursues competitive energy opportunities through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Con Edison Solutions, Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Development. These businesses sell to retail customers electricity purchased in wholesale markets and enter into related hedging transactions, provide energy-related products and services to wholesale and retail customers, and develop, own and operate renewable and energy infrastructure projects. At December31, 2014, Con Edisons equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was $464 million and their assets were $1,025 million.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 11 Table of Contents Utility Regulation State Utility Regulation Regulators The Utilities are subject to regulation by the NYSPSC, which under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. It also approves the issuance of the Utilities securities. It exercises jurisdiction over the siting of the Utilities electric transmission lines and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. In addition, it has the authority to impose penalties on utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and its orders. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to similar regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU). O&Rs Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike, is subject to similar regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU and the PAPUC, are referred to herein as state utility regulators.
In March 2013, following the issuance of recommendations by a commission established by the Governor of New York and submission by the Governor of a bill to the State legislature, the New York Public Service Law was amended to, among other things, authorize the NYSPSC to (i)levy expanded penalties against combination gas and electric utilities; (ii)review, at least every five years, an electric utilitys capability to provide safe, adequate and reliable service, order the utility to comply with additional and more stringent terms of service than existed prior to the review, assess the continued operation of the utility as the provider of electric service in its service territory and propose, and act upon, such measures as are necessary to ensure safe and adequate service; and (iii)based on findings of repeated violations of the New York Public Service Law or rules or regulations adopted thereto that demonstrate a failure of a combination gas and electric utility to continue to provide safe and adequate service, revoke or modify an operating certificate issued to the utility by the NYSPSC (following consideration of certain factors, including public interest and standards deemed necessary by the NYSPSC to ensure continuity of service, and due process).
Electric Utility Industry Restructuring In New York In the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state. In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the Utilities sold all of their electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONYs steam business (see Electric Operations  Electric Facilities below) and provided all of their customers the choice to buy electricity or gas from the Utilities or other suppliers (see Electric Operations  Electric Sales and Deliveries and Gas Operations  Gas Sales and Deliveries below). In addition, the Utilities no longer control and operate their electric transmission facilities. See New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), below.
Following industry restructuring, there were several utility mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by one of four investor-owned utility companies  Con Edison, National Grid plc, Iberdrola, S.A. and Fortis Inc.  or one of two state authorities  New York Power Authority (NYPA) or Long Island Power Authority.
Reforming the Energy Vision Proceeding In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding, the goals of which are to improve electric system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources (DER), and empower customer choice. In this proceeding, the NYSPSC is examining the establishment of a Distributed System Platform (DSP) to manage and coordinate DER, and provide customers with market data and tools to manage their energy use. The NYSPSC also is examining how its regulatory practices should be modified to incent utility practices to promote REV objectives. The proceeding will follow a two-phased schedule with policy determinations for DSP and related matters expected in early 2015 and for regulatory design and regulatory matters, later in 2015.
In August 2014, the NYSPSC staff issued a straw proposal in the REV proceeding in which it indicated that [t]he reforms envisioned in this proceeding are comprehensive and transformative, and the on-going design and pragmatic implementation of them will take years. The NYSPSC staff recommended, among other things, that:  The NYSPSC should adopt the basic elements of the REV vision and proceed with implementation as proposed in the straw proposal;  Existing utilities should serve as DSPs subject to performance reviews;  Customers and energy service providers should have access to energy usage information to enable customers to assess the economic value of off-peak usage;  Where utility affiliates participate in DSP markets within the service territory operated by their parent company, appropriate market power protections must be in place; and  As a transition toward market-based approaches to increase levels of efficiency and renewable energy, utilities should integrate energy efficiency into their regular operations and should take responsibility for procurement of renewable energy.
In December 2014, the NYSPSC encouraged utilities and third parties to begin working together to develop potential 12 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents demonstration projects that will inform decisions with respect to developing DSP functionalities, measuring customer response to programs and prices associated with REV markets, and determining the most effective implementation of DER.
The Companies are not able to predict the outcome of the REV proceeding or its impact.
Rate Plans Investor-owned utilities in the United States provide service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state utility regulator. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the utilities to amounts that recover from their customers costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. The utilities earnings depend on the limits on rates authorized in their rate plans and their ability to operate their businesses in a manner consistent with such rate plans.
The utilities rate plans cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In NewYork, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate plan, and a new rate plan filed by the utility will generally take effect automatically in approximately 11months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan.
In each rate proceeding, rates are determined by the state utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the proceeding can also review the utilitys proposal and become involved in the rate proceeding. The review process is overseen by an Administrative Law Judge. After an Administrative Law Judge issues a recommended decision, that generally considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other parties, and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The utility and the regulators staff and interested parties may enter jointly into a proposed settlement agreement prior to the completion of this administrative process, in which case the agreement could be approved by the regulator with or without modification.
For each rate plan, the revenues needed to provide the utility a return on invested capital is determined by multiplying the utilities forecasted rate base by the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital determined in the rate plan. In general, rate base is the sum of the utilitys net plant and working capital less deferred taxes. The NYSPSC uses a forecast of the average rate base for the year that new rates would be in effect (rate year). The NJBPU and the PAPUC use the rate base balances that would exist at the beginning of the rate year. The capital structure used in the weighted average cost of capital is determined using actual and forecast data for the same time periods as rate base. The costs of long-term debt, customer deposits and the allowed return on common equity represent a combination of actual and forecast financing information. The allowed return on common equity is determined by each states respective utility regulator. The NYSPSCs current methodology for determining the allowed return on common equity assigns a one-third weight to an estimate determined from a capital asset pricing model applied to a peer group of utility companies and a two-thirds weight to an estimate determined from a dividend discount model using stock prices and dividend forecasts for a peer group of utility companies. Both methodologies employ market measurements of equity capital to estimate returns rather than the accounting measurements to which such estimates are applied in setting rates.
Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, there generally can be no change to the rates charged to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans.
For information about the Utilities rate plans see Note B to the financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated by reference herein).
Liability for Service Interruptions and Other Non-rate Conditions of Service The tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service limit the companys liability to pay for damages resulting from service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
CECONYs tariff for electric service also provides for reimbursement to electric customers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions in certain circumstances. In general, the company is obligated to reimburse affected residential and commercial customers for food spoilage of up to $450 and $9,000, respectively, and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. The companys maximum aggregate liability for such reimbursement for an incident is $15 million. The company is not required to provide reimbursement to electric customers for outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond its control, such as storms, provided the company makes reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as practicable.
In June 2013, a commission established by the Governor of New York issued its final report on utility storm preparation and CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 13 Table of Contents response. The commission made recommendations regarding, among other things, preparation and response to flooding; estimation of customer restoration times; reliability of website outage maps; coordination with local governments and providers of other utility services; availability and allocation of staffing and other resources (including the utility industrys mutual aid process); and communications with affected communities and local officials. The commissions report also addressed the Long Island Power Authority, energy efficiency programs, utility infrastructure investment and regulatory deficiencies.
In August 2013, the NYSPSC approved emergency response plans submitted by the Utilities, subject to certain modifications. Pursuant to the New York Public Service Law, as amended in 2013 (see Regulators, above), each electric utility is required to submit to the NYSPSC annually a plan for the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of widespread outages in the utilitys service territory due to storms or other events beyond the control of the utility. If, after evidentiary hearings or other investigatory proceedings, the NYSPSC finds that the utility failed to implement its plan reasonably, the NYSPSC may deny recovery of any part of the service restoration costs caused by such failure.
In November 2013, the NYSPSC adopted statewide policies pursuant to which the Utilities are required to provide credits to customers who are without electric service for more than three days; adjust rate plan revenue targets so the credits would not be recovered pursuant to revenue decoupling mechanisms; and temporarily suspend collection-related activities and service terminations for such customers (or, if the NYSPSC determines, to all residential customers in a designated area and certain other customers). The credit to a customer would equal the portion of the monthly customer charge attributable to the period the customer was without service. If an extraordinary event occurs, the NYSPSC may direct New York gas utilities to implement the same policies.
In December 2013, the NYSPSC approved a scorecard for use as a guide in assessing electric utility performance in restoring electric service during outages that result from a major storm event, to assist in holding the utilities accountable to certain performance levels, and to guide utilities as to the NYSPSCs expectations for their restoration efforts. The order indicated that the scorecard, which could also be applied by the NYSPSC for other outages or actions, was developed to work with the penalty and emergency response plan provisions of the New York Public Service Law, as amended in 2013 (see Regulators, above). The scorecard includes performance metrics in categories for preparation, operations response and communications. Within 30 days of the completion of customer restoration, electric utilities are required to provide data for the scorecard. The NYSPSC staff would use the data to assess performance against the metrics and determine a score for each such event for each electric utility.
Generic Proceedings The NYSPSC from time to time conducts generic proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include the REV proceeding, discussed above, and proceedings relating to utilities exiting the service of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities existing responsibility to act as provider of last resort); the utilities vision for the smart grid; utility staffing levels; and the implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs and consumer protections. The Utilities are typically active participants in such proceedings.
Federal Utility Regulation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC has the authority to impose penalties, which could be substantial, including penalties for the violation of reliability and cyber security rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail commodity sales and local delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates that include both distribution and transmission costs. FERC approval is being sought to recover costs for certain transmission projects. See Con Edison Transmission, below New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of the Utilities, as an integrated system and administers wholesale markets for electricity in New York State. In addition to operating the states high voltage grid, the NYISO administers the energy, ancillary services and capacity markets. The New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC) promulgates reliability standards subject to FERC oversight. Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the NYSRC, the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (owned, procured through the NYISO capacity markets or contracted for) in an amount equal to the peak demand of their customers plus the applicable reserve margin. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough capacity that is electrically located in NewYork City to cover a substantial percentage (currently 85percent; 83.5 percent effective May 2015) of the peak demands of their New York City customers. These 14 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents requirements apply both to regulated utilities such as CECONY and O&R for the customers they supply under regulated tariffs and to companies such as Con Edison Solutions that supply customers on market terms. To address the possibility of a disruption due to the unavailability of gas, generating units located in New York City that are capable of using either gas or oil as fuel may be required to use oil as fuel for certain periods and new generating units are required to have dual fuel capability. RECO, O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary, provides electric service in an area that has a different independent system operator  PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM). See CECONY  Electric Operations  Electric Supply and O&RElectric Operations  Electric Supply, below.
New York Energy Highway In October 2012, the Energy Highway Task Force appointed by the Governor of New York issued its Blueprint containing recommendations to modernize New Yorks energy systems. The recommended actions included electric transmission construction and upgrades to electric and natural gas infrastructure. In November 2012, the NYSPSC established a proceeding to review specific proposals from utilities and private developers for new electric transmission lines and upgrades to existing facilities that will address transmission congestion between upstate and downstate. See Con Edison Transmission, below.
Competition Distributed generation, such as solar energy production facilities, fuel cells and micro-turbines, provide alternative sources of energy for the Utilities electric delivery customers, as does oil for the Utilities gas delivery customers. Other distributed energy resources, such as demand reduction and energy efficiency programs, also provide alternatives for the Utilities delivery customers. In its ongoing REV proceeding, the NYSPSC is considering the extent to which New York electric distribution utilities and their affiliates will be permitted to compete with other providers of distributed energy resources. See Reforming the Energy Vision Proceeding above. At December31, 2014, there were 4,200 and 1,953 distributed generation projects interconnected with CECONY and O&R, respectively, with aggregate capacities as shown on the following table: CECONY O&R Technology TotalMW % TotalMW % Internal-combustion engines 101 46 25 46 Photovoltaic solar 58 26 28 52 Gas turbines 40 18 - - Micro turbines 9 5 1 2 Fuel cells 8 4 - - Steam turbines 3 1 - - Total Distribution-level distributed generation 219 100 % 54 100 % The Utilities do not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service of electricity, natural gas or steam where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements, install facilities to provide the service, meet applicable services standards, and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees and costs imposed on the service. A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the NYSPSC. See Utility Regulation  State Utility Regulation  Regulators.
The competitive energy businesses participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses and renewable and energy infrastructure projects that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the Utilities.
The Utilities CECONY CECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses.
For a discussion of the companys operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see Results of Operations in Item7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8.
Electric Operations Electric Facilities CECONYs capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $15,531 million and $14,496 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $2,744 million and $2,597million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and for its portion of the steam-electric generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $451 million and $452 million, at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 15 Table of Contents Distribution Facilities.
CECONY owns 62 area distribution substations and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December31, 2014, the companys distribution system had a transformer capacity of 29,474 MVA, with 36,934 miles of overhead distribution lines and 98,327 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in the UnitedStates.
Transmission Facilities.
The companys transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in NewYork State. At December31, 2014, CECONY owned or jointly owned 438 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 749 miles of underground circuits operating at 69, 138 and 345 kV. The companys 39transmission substations and 62 area stations are supplied by circuits operated at 69 kV and above. In 2013, the NYSPSC approved transmission projects to address, among other things, reliability concerns associated with the potential closure of the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). See CECONY  Electric Operations Electric Supply and Con Edison Transmission, below.
CECONYs transmission facilities interconnect with those of National Grid, Central Hudson Gas& Electric Corporation, O&R, New York State Electric& Gas (NYSEG), Connecticut Light& Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.
Generating Facilities.
CECONYs electric generating facilities consist of plants located in Manhattan with an aggregate capacity of 705 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2015 for use in these facilities.
Electric Sales and Deliveries CECONY delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its customers who choose to purchase electricity from other energy suppliers (energy choice program). In addition, the company delivers electricity to state and municipal customers of NYPA and economic development customers of municipal electric agencies.
The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. CECONYs electric revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONYs electric sales and deliveries for the last five years were: Year Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Electric Energy Delivered (millions of kWhs) CECONY full service customers 24,142 22,622 20,622 20,118 19,757 Delivery service for energy choice customers 23,098 24,234 25,990 26,574 26,221 Delivery service to NYPA customers and others 10,834 10,408 10,267 10,226 10,325 Delivery service for municipal agencies 619 562 322 - - Total Deliveries in Franchise Area 58,693 57,826 57,201 56,918 56,303 Electric Energy Delivered ($ in millions) CECONY full service customers $ 5,546 $ 5,237 $ 4,731 $ 4,799 $ 5,023 Delivery service for energy choice customers 2,123 2,354 2,750 2,683 2,646 Delivery service to NYPA customers and others 516 555 596 602 625 Delivery service for municipal agencies 22 22 10 - - Other operating revenues 169 60 89 47 143 Total Deliveries in Franchise Area $ 8,376 $ 8,228 $ 8,176 $ 8,131 $ 8,437 Average Revenue per kWh Sold (Cents)(a) Residential 25.8 25.6 25.6 27.0 28.9 Commercial and Industrial 20.4 20.7 20.0 20.6 22.1 (a) Includes Municipal Agency sales.

Electric Peak Demand The electric peak demand in CECONYs service area generally occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The weather during the summer of 2014 was cooler than design conditions. CECONYs 2014 service area peak demand was 12,198 MW, which occurred on September2, 2014. The 2014 peak demand included an estimated 4,937 MW for CECONYs full-service customers, 5,435 MW for customers participating in its electric energy choice program and 1,825 MW for NYPAs electric commodity customers and municipal electric agency customers. Design weather for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the NYISO can invoke demand reduction programs under specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs potential impact. However, the CECONY forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of other demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2015 service area peak demand will be 13,775 MW, including an estimated 5,750 MW for its full-service customers, 5,960 MW for its electric energy choice customers and 2,065 MW for NYPAs customers and municipal electric agency customers. The company forecasts average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.9 percent per year.
Electric Supply Most of the electricity sold by CECONY to its full-service customers in 2014 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2015. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts, purchased through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the companys contracts for approximately 2,029 MW of electric generating capacity, see Notes I and O to the financial statements in Item8. To reduce the volatility of its customers electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market.
CECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December31, 2014, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 705 MW, based on 2014 summer test ratings. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see Electric Operations  Electric Facilities  Generating Facilities, above.
In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks  Commodity Price Risk, in Item7 and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
CECONY monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO. In addition, the NYISO has adopted reliability rules that include obligations on transmission owners (such as CECONY) to construct facilities that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO. See New York Independent System Operator above. In a July 1998 order, the NYSPSC indicated that it agree(s) generally that CECONY need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops, but considers overly broad and did not adopt CECONYs request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity.
In November 2012, the NYSPSC directed CECONY to work with NYPA to develop a contingency plan to address reliability concerns associated with the potential closure by the end of 2015 of the nuclear power plants at the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). In February 2013, CECONY and NYPA submitted their plan, and, in October 2013, the NYSPSC approved three transmission projects and several energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs to address concerns associated with the potential closure. The transmission projects, which also address transmission congestion between upstate and downstate and make available more generation from Staten Island, are scheduled to be placed into service by 2016. See Con Edison Transmission below.
In February 2014, CECONY submitted to the NYSPSC the implementation plan for the energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs, which are CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 17 Table of Contents estimated to cost up to $285 million. In April 2014, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY to recover its program costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred from 2014 through 2016, over a ten-year period through a surcharge billed to its electric delivery customers.
In 2009, the then Governor of New York announced a new goal of meeting 45 percent of the States electricity needs with energy efficiency or renewable resources by 2015. The goal is to be achieved by reducing electricity consumption by 15percent, and having 30 percent of the electricity used in New York provided by renewable resources. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) reported that as of the second quarter of 2014, the State had achieved 91 percent of its natural gas efficiency goal and 77percent of its electric efficiency goal and that the State is unlikely to achieve the 30 percent renewable electricity goal. In March 2014, NYSERDA reported as of the fourth quarter of 2013 it had achieved 49 percent of its renewable electricity goal, and expects to achieve 86 percent or less of the 30percent renewable electricity goal by the end of 2015. For information about the Utilities participation in New York States clean energy programs, see Environmental Matters  Climate Change, below.
Gas Operations Gas Facilities CECONYs capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $4,530 million and $4,013 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to CECONY at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 4,330 miles of mains and 369,339 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store 1,062 MDt of which a maximum of about 250 MDt can be withdrawn per day. The company has about 1,226 MDt of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8percent owned by CECONY and 71.2 percent owned by Con Edison Development.
Gas Sales and Deliveries The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. CECONYs gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONYs gas sales and deliveries for the last five years were: Year Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Gas Delivered (MDt) Firm Sales Full service 63,592 64,696 57,595 67,007 75,630 Firm transportation 51,859 54,291 52,860 61,139 68,731 Total Firm Sales 115,451 118,987 110,455 128,146 144,361 Interruptible Sales(a) 8,521 10,035 5,961 10,900 10,498 Total Gas Delivered to CECONY Customers 123,972 129,022 116,416 139,046 154,859 Transportation of customer-owned gas NYPA 24,890 34,893 48,107 48,682 47,548 Other (mainly generating plants) 99,666 97,163 108,086 87,379 105,012 Off-System Sales 7 97 730 4,638 15 Total Sales 248,535 261,175 273,339 279,745 307,434 (a)Includes 6,057, 5,362, 563, 3,801 and 3,385 MDt for 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which are also reflected in firm transportation and other.

For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item8.
Gas Peak Demand The gas peak demand for firm sales customers in CECONYs service area occurs during the winter heating season. The peak day demand during the winter 2014/2015 (through February2, 2015) occurred on January7, 2015 when the demand reached 1,118 MDt. The 2014/2015 peak demand included 574 MDt for CECONYs full-service customers and 544 MDt for customers participating in its gas energy choice program. Design weather for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2015/2016 service area peak demand will be 1,408 MDt, including an estimated 729 MDt for its full-service customers and 679 MDt for its gas energy choice customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 2.8 percent in its service area. The forecasted peak demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers including generating stations (electricity and steam).
Gas Supply CECONY and O&R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, CECONY (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note S to the financial statements in Item8.
Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The gas supply contracts are for various terms extending to 2016. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation from upstream points where gas has been purchased to the Utilities distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage contracts are approved by the FERC. Such contracts are for various terms extending to 2027. The Utilities are required to pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $286 million in 2014, including $246 million for CECONY. See Contractual Obligations below. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for interruptible gas transportation. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
Steam Operations Steam Facilities CECONYs capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for its portion of the steam-electric generation facilities were $1,795 million and $1,790 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
CECONY generates steam at one steam-electric generating station and five steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 105 miles of transmission, distribution, and service piping.

Steam Peak Demand and Capacity Demand for steam in CECONYs service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of 2014/2015 (through February2, 2015) occurred on January8, 2015 when the demand reached 8.4 MMlb per hour. Design weather for the steam system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The companys estimate for the winter of 2015/2016 peak demand of its steam customers is about 9.0 MMlb per hour under design conditions. The company forecasts average annual decrease in steam peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.8 percent.
On December31, 2014, the steam system was capable of delivering approximately 11.6 MMlb of steam per hour, and CECONY estimates that the system will have the same capability in the 2015/2016 winter.
Steam Supply Forty-two percent of the steam produced by CECONY in 2014 was supplied by the companys steam-only generating assets; 41 percent was produced by the companys steam-electric generating assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 17 percent was purchased under an agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P.
O&R Electric Operations Electric Facilities O&Rs capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $830 million and $781 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $212 million and $179 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
O&R, RECO and Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 572 circuit miles of transmission lines, 14 transmission substations, 62 distribution substations, 86,379 in-service line transformers, 3,991 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 1,869 miles of underground distribution lines. O&Rs transmission system is part of the NYISO system except that portions of RECOs system are located within the transmission area controlled by PJM.
20 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Electric Sales and Deliveries O&R delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its customers who purchase electricity from other suppliers through the companys energy choice program.
The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. O&R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. O&Rs New York electric revenues (which accounted for 77.2 percent of O&Rs electric revenues in 2014) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, O&Rs New York electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&Rs electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not subject to a decoupling mechanism. O&Rs electric sales and deliveries for the last five years were: Year Ended December31, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Electric Energy Delivered (millions of kWhs) Total deliveries to O&R full service customers 3,498 3,029 2,691 2,555 2,429 Delivery service for energy choice customers 2,330 2,760 3,040 3,166 3,240 Total Deliveries In Franchise Area 5,828 5,789 5,731 5,721 5,669 Electric Energy Delivered ($ in millions) Total deliveries to O&R full service customers $ 570 $ 486 $ 405 $ 427 $ 455 Delivery service for energy choice customers 132 157 178 192 207 Other operating revenues (10 ) (2 ) 9 9 18 Total Deliveries In Franchise Area $ 692 $ 641 $ 592 $ 628 $ 680 Average Revenue Per kWh Sold (Cents) Residential 18.3 18.0 16.7 18.1 20.3 Commercial and Industrial 14.1 13.7 13.0 14.8 16.8 For further discussion of the companys electric operating revenues and its electric results, see Results of Operations in Item7. For additional segment information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item8.
Electric Peak Demand The electric peak demand in O&Rs service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The weather during the summer of 2014 was cooler than design conditions. O&Rs 2014 service area peak demand was 1,370 MW, which occurred on July2, 2014. The 2014 peak demand included an estimated 697 MW for O&Rs full-service customers and 673MW for customers participating in its electric energy choice program. Design weather for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the NYISO can invoke demand reduction programs under specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs potential impact. However, the O&R forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of permanent demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2015 service area peak demand will be 1,645 MW, including an estimated 819 MW for its full-service customers and 826 MW for its electric energy choice customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak electric demand in the companys service area over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.9percent per year.
Electric Supply The electricity O&R sold to its full-service customers in 2014 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity markets administered by the NYISO and PJM. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2015. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts or purchased through the NYISO or PJMs wholesale electricity market. To reduce the volatility of its customers electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO and PJMs wholesale electricity market. For information about the companys contracts, see Note O to the financial statements in Item8.
In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks  Commodity Price Risk, in Item7 and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 21 Table of Contents Gas Operations Gas Facilities O&Rs capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $476 million and $456 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. O&R and Pike own their gas distribution systems and O&R owns a gas transmission system. Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to O&R at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 1,867 miles of mains and 105,077 service lines.
Gas Sales and Deliveries O&R generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. O&Rs gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause. O&Rs New York gas revenues (which accounted for substantially all of O&Rs gas revenues in 2014) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism.

Gas Peak Demand The gas peak demand for firm sales customers in O&Rs service area occurs during the winter heating season. The peak day demand during the winter 2014/2015 (through February2, 2015) occurred on January7, 2015 when the demand reached 191 MDt. The 2014/2015 peak day demand included 86 MDt for O&Rs full-service customers and 105 MDt for customers participating in its gas energy choice program. Design weather for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, 22 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents the 2015/2016 service area peak day demand will be 218 MDt, including an estimated 100 MDt for its full-service customers and 118 MDt for its gas energy choice customers. The company forecasts average annual growth of the peak gas demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.6percent in its service area. The forecasted peak day demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers including electricity generating stations.
Gas Supply O&R and CECONY have combined their gas requirements and purchase contracts to meet those requirements into a single portfolio. See CECONY  Gas Operations  Gas Supply above.

Con Edison Solutions seeks to serve customers in utility service territories that encourage retail competition through transparent pricing, purchase of receivables programs or utility-sponsored customer acquisition programs. The company currently sells electricity in the service territories of 53 utilities in the states of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Ohio and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia. In 2014, approximately 29 percent of the sales volumes were in New York, 29 percent in New England, 34percent in the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and 8 percent in Texas.
The electricity Con Edison Solutions sold to its customers in 2014 was purchased primarily through wholesale electricity markets administered by the NYISO, PJM, Independent System Operator New England and Electric Reliability Council of Texas. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2015. Con Edison Energy provides hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions.
Con Edison Solutions also provides energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers. The services include the design and installation of lighting retrofits, high-efficiency heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment and other energy saving technologies. The company is compensated for its services based primarily on the increased energy efficiency of the installed equipment over a multi-year period. Con Edison Solutions has won competitive solicitations for energy savings contracts with the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, and a shared energy savings contract with the United States Postal Service. The company owns renewable energy projects predominately in Massachusetts and California with an aggregate capacity of 20MW (AC).
Con Edison Energy Con Edison Energy provides services to manage the dispatch, fuel requirements and risk management activities for 5,005 MW of generating plants in the northeastern United States owned by unrelated parties and manages energy supply assets leased from others. Among other things, the company also provides wholesale hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development. The company, beginning during 2013, no longer engages in the sale of electricity to utilities.

Con Edison Transmission In September 2014, Con Edison formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Con Edison Transmission. In November 2014, Con Edison Transmission, along with affiliates of certain other NewYork transmission owners, formed New York Transco LLC (NYTransco). NY Transcos transmission projects are expected to be developed initially by CECONY and other New York transmission owners and then sold to NY Transco, a transaction that is subject to authorizations from the NYSPSC and FERC. In December 2014, CECONY, certain other New York transmission owners and NY Transco made filings with the FERC to establish NY Transcos transmission rate and authorize the sale of the projects to NY Transco.
NY Transco projects may include three projects ($450 million aggregate estimated cost) the NYSPSC approved in October 2013 in its proceeding to address potential needs that could arise should the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries) no longer be able to operate. These projects, which are scheduled to be placed into service by Summer 2016, include two projects ($383 million aggregate estimated cost) that CECONY is developing and one project that two other New York transmission owners are developing.
NY Transcos projects may also include one or more projects proposed on behalf of the NY Transco for consideration by the NYSPSC in its competitive proceeding to select transmission projects that would relieve transmission congestion between upstate and downstate. Depending on the project alternative(s), if any, selected by the NYSPSC, the aggregate estimated costs of the NY Transco projects could range up to approximately $1,200 million. The NY Transco projects, which could be completed in the 2019 to 2021 timeframe, would be developed, at least initially, by New York transmission owners other than CECONY until they are sold to NY Transco.

(b) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of energy that the company is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.
(c) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.
(d) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing system as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the Other Purchase Obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to enable them to report their Other Purchase Obligations in a different manner.
(e) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, renewable energy certificates, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity, energy efficiency services and construction services entered into by Con Edisons competitive energy businesses.
The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of Con Edison Transmission and its competitive energy businesses. See Notes E, F, O and Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements in Item8.
26 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison finances its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and the sale of its securities. Con Edisons ability to make payments on external borrowings and dividends on its common shares depends on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.
For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements in Item8.
For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item8.
The Utilities finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds (see Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows from Operating Activities in Item7), contributions of equity capital from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings.
The Companies expect to meet their 2015 capital requirements, including for maturing securities, through internally-generated funds and the issuance of between $1,000million and $1,500 million of long-term debt. Con Edison does not expect to need to issue common equity in 2015 other than through its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and long term incentive plans.
The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally-generated funds. See Capital Requirements, above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market conditions may affect the timing and cost of the Companies financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the Companies long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item8.
In 2012, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY, through 2016, to issue up to $3,500 million of debt securities ($2,550 million of which the company had issued as of December31, 2014). In 2013, the NYSPSC authorized O&R, through 2017, to issue up to $305 million of debt securities (none of which the company had issued as of December31, 2014). The NYSPSC also authorized CECONY and O&R for such periods to issue up to $2,500 million and $125 million, respectively, of debt securities to refund existing debt securities. At December31, 2014, the Utilities had not refunded any securities pursuant to this authorization.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings. In April 2013, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $219 million aggregate principal amount of 4.78 percent senior notes secured by certain of the companys California solar electric production projects. In 2014, the company sold a 50 percent interest in the subsidiary. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.
For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) for the last five years was: RatioofEarningstoFixedCharges 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Con Edison 3.3 3.6 3.7 3.0 (a) 3.6 CECONY 3.4 3.8 3.7 3.7 3.8 (a) Reflects $95 million after-tax charge to earnings relating to Con Edison Developments LILO transactions. See Note J to the financial statements in Item8.
For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio for the last five years was: Common Equity Ratio (Percent of total capitalization) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Con Edison 50.4 52.5 54.1 53.9 52.0 CECONY 49.9 52.0 53.6 53.7 50.7 The commercial paper of Con Edison and O&R is rated P-2, A-2 and F2, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch. The commercial paper of CECONY is rated P-1, A-2 and F2 by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. Con Edisons long-term credit rating is A3, BBB+ and BBB+ by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. The unsecured debt of CECONY is rated A2, A- and A- by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. The unsecured debt of O&R is rated A3, A- and A- by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have withdrawn the ratings of these insurers. Subsequently, there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 27 Table of Contents been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax-exempt debt was 0.13 percent on December31, 2014. The weighted average interest rate was 0.10 percent, 0.17 percent, and 0.29percent for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Under CECONYs current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels set in rates.
Environmental Matters Climate Change As indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing the worlds climate.
Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies energy services. It might also cause physical damage to the Companies facilities and disruption of their operations due to more frequent and more extreme weather-related events. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities electric distribution system. Superstorm Sandy interrupted service to approximately 1.4million of the Utilities customers  more than four times the number of customers impacted by the Utilities previous worst storm event (Hurricane Irene in 2011). See Other Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements in Item8.
Based on the most recent data (2014)published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its direct GHG emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the nations GHG emissions. Con Edisons estimated emissions of GHG during the past five years were: (metric tons, in millions(a)) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 CO 2 equivalent emissions 3.8 3.4 3.3 3.4 3.2 (a) Estimated emissions for 2014 are subject to third-party verification.
Con Edisons 47 percent decrease in direct GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and sulfur hexafluoride) since 2005 (6.0 million metric tons) reflects the emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, reduced steam demand, the increased use of natural gas in lieu of fuel oil at CECONYs steam production facilities as well as projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions and to replace gas distribution pipes.
CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure, and by introducing new technologies for leak repair prioritization and to reduce work-related losses. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing older equipment. The Utilities also actively promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable generation to help their customers reduce their GHG emissions.
NYSERDA and New York utilities are responsible for implementing the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) established by the NYSPSC through energy efficiency, targeted demand-side management and demand-response programs. The Utilities billed customers EEPS surcharges of approximately $103 million and $100 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, to fund these programs. Through the Utilities energy-efficiency programs, customers reduced their annual energy use by approximately 2,390,000 MWh of electricity and 3,670,000 Dt of gas from the programs inception in 2009 through 2014, resulting in their avoiding their release of approximately 1,055,000 tons of GHG into the atmosphere every year. CECONYs demand-side management programs assisted customers in reducing their annual energy use by approximately 295,000 MWh of electricity from the programs inception in 2004 through 2014, resulting in their avoiding their release of approximately 105,000 tons of GHG into the atmosphere every year.
Emissions are also avoided through the development of renewable generation. NYSERDA is responsible for implementing the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) established by the NYSPSC. NYSERDA enters into long-term agreements with developers of large renewable electric production facilities and pays them premiums based on the facilities electric output. These facilities sell their energy output in the wholesale energy market administered by the NYISO. As a result of the Utilities participation in the NYISO wholesale markets, a portion of the Utilities NYISO energy purchases are sourced from renewable electric production facilities. NYSERDA also provides rebates to customers who install eligible renewable electric production technologies. The electricity produced by such customer-sited renewables offsets the energy which the Utilities would otherwise have procured, thereby reducing the amount of electricity produced by non-renewable production facilities. The Utilities billed customers RPS surcharges of $121 million and $109 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, (and approximately $547 million cumulatively from 2006) to fund these NYSERDA programs. In March 2014, NYSERDA reported that the statewide environmental benefits of having electricity generated by renewable production facilities from 2006 through 2013, as opposed to the States system-mix, amounts to approximately 5,400 tons of nitrogen oxides, 10,600 tons of sulfur dioxides, and 5.3million tons of carbon dioxide in reduced emissions over this time period.
In May 2014, the NYSPSC directed NYSERDA to submit for its consideration a proposal for a comprehensive clean energy 28 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents fund. In September 2014, NYSERDA submittedits clean energy fund proposal seeking a 10-year program that it indicated is designed to pursue greater scale for clean energy in the NewYork economy; foster new investment opportunities to attract private capital to invest in clean energy in New York; and significantly reduce GHG emissions from New Yorks energy sector.
In June 2014, the EPA proposed its Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 30percent from 2005 levels by 2030. As proposed, each state will be required to submit for EPA approval a plan to reduce its emissions rate (as determined in accordance with the Clean Power Plan) to a specified target level applicable to the state. For New York State, the emissions rate target level for 2030 would be 44 percent below its 2012 level. State plans may, among other things, include participation in regional cap-and-trade programs, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (in which New York State participates), and renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. Initial state plans would be due by June 2016, with single-state plans to be finalized by June 2017 and multi-state plans to be finalized by June 2018. The costs resulting from the Clean Power Plan could be substantial.
Beginning in 2009 CECONY became subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The Initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, established a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to a level fifteen percent below the Initiatives baseline by 2020. Under the Initiative, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions administered by participating states or a secondary market. CECONY met its requirement of 6.3million allowances for the first RGGI compliance period (2009-2011) and has purchased sufficient allowances to meet its requirement for the second compliance period (2012-2014). In February 2013, RGGI released a model rule for adoption by the participating states that includes a 45percent reduction in the emissions cap for 2014 and further reductions of 2.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2020. NewYork State adopted the model rule, and the lower cap was effective as of January1, 2014.
Also, New York State and New York City have announced goals to reduce GHG emissions 80 percent below 1990 and 2005 levels respectively, by 2050. The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies GHG emissions could be substantial.
Environmental Sustainability Con Edisons sustainability strategy, as it relates to the environment, provides that the company seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by making effective use of natural resources to address the challenges of climate change and its impact on the companys business. As part of its strategy, the company seeks, among other things, to reduce direct and indirect emissions; enhance the efficiency of its water use; minimize its impact to natural ecosystems; focus on reducing, reusing, and recycling to minimize consumption; and design its work in consideration of climate forecasts.
CECONY Superfund The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, its former Flushing Service Center site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the Company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites CECONY and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at 51 sites (MGP Sites) in New York City and Westchester County. Many of these sites have been subdivided and are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) is requiring CECONY to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.
CECONY has started remedial investigations at all 51 MGP Sites. After investigations, no MGP impacts have been detected at all or portions of 15 sites, and the NYSDEC has issued No Further Action (NFA) letters for these sites.
Coal tar or other MGP-related contaminants have been detected at the remaining 36 sites. Remedial actions have been completed at all or portions of five sites and the NYSDEC has issued NFA letters for these sites. In addition, remedial actions CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 29 Table of Contents have been completed by property owners at all or portions of three sites under the NYS Brownfield Cleanup Program and Certificates of Completion have been issued by the NYSDEC for these sites. Remedial design is ongoing for the remaining sites, however, the information as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required for many of these sites is incomplete. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites (other than the Astoria site which is discussed below) could range from $490 million to $2,129 million.
Astoria Site CECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property owned by the company in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to remediate the contamination. The companys investigations are on-going. The company has submitted to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports and in the future will be submitting additional reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property could range from $156 million to $462 million.
Flushing Service Center Site In September 2007, the NYSDEC demanded that the company investigate and remediate PCB contamination that may have migrated from a former CECONY service center facility in Flushing New York, into the adjacent Flushing River. In April 2008, the company and NYSDEC entered into a consent order under which the company agreed to implement a NYSDEC-approved investigation program for the Flushing River and, if deemed necessary by the NYSDEC to protect human health and the environment, to implement a NYSDEC-approved remediation program for any PCB contamination in the river attributable to the site. In March 2011, the company submitted to NYSDEC a report indicating that PCBs had migrated from the site to sediment in a portion of the river. In August 2013, the NYSDEC selected a remedy that requires the company to submit a remedial design report, remove contaminated sediment, restore the river bed with clean material, prepare a site management plan and implement institutional controls. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the cleanup in Flushing River will be at least $5.3million.
Gowanus Canal In August 2009, CECONY received a notice of potential liability and request for information from the EPA about the operations of the company and its predecessors at sites adjacent or near the 1.8 mile Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York. In March 2010, the EPA added the Gowanus Canal to its National Priorities List of Superfund sites. The canals adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses, and parking lots, and the canal is near several residential neighborhoods. In September 2013, the EPA issued its record of decision for the site. The EPA concluded that there was significant contamination at the site, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, metals, and volatile organic compounds. The EPA selected a remedy for the site that includes dredging and disposal of some contaminated sediments and stabilization and capping of contamination that will not be removed. The EPA estimated the cost of the selected remedy to be $506.1 million (and indicated the actual cost could be significantly higher or lower). The EPA has identified 39 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the site, including CECONY (which the EPA indicated has facilities that may be a source of PCBs at the site). The EPA has ordered the PRPs, including CECONY, to coordinate and cooperate with each other to perform and/or fund the remedial design for the selected remedy. CECONY is unable to estimate its exposure to liability with respect to the Gowanus Canal site.
Other Superfund Sites CECONY is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites involving other PRPs and participates in PRP groups at these sites. The company generally is not responsible for managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring activities at some of these sites can be expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.
The following table lists each of CECONYs other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under Start), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings for the site are pending and CECONYs estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is $0.2million or less, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site for which the estimate is $1 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The companys estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements 30 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The companys actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.
O&R has completed remedial investigations at all seven of its MGP sites and has received NYSDECs decision regarding the remedial work to be performed at six of the sites. Of the six sites, O&R has completed remediation at three sites. Remedial design is ongoing for the remaining three sites. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites could range from $96 million to $155 million.
Superfund Sites O&R is a PRP at Superfund sites involving other PRPs, and participates in PRP groups at those sites. The company is not managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty Superfund sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites is expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.
The following table lists each of these Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in the table under Start), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and O&Rs estimated percentage of total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is less than $0.3 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The companys estimate of its anticipated share of the total liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The companys actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The Utilities have procedures in place to properly manage and dispose of oil and equipment containing PCBs when they are removed from service.
Water Quality Under NYSDEC regulations, the operation of CECONYs generating facilities requires permits for water discharges. Regulations that became effective in 2013 require permits for water withdrawals. Conditions to the renewal of such permits may include limitations on the operations of the permitted facility or requirements to install certain equipment, the cost of which could be substantial. For information about the companys generating facilities, see CECONY  Electric Operations  Electric Facilities and Steam Operations  Steam Facilities above in this Item1.
Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONYs service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.
Air Quality Under new source review regulations, an owner of a large generating facility, including CECONYs steam and steam-electric generating facilities, is required to obtain a permit before CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 31 Table of Contents making modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that increase emissions of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain a permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis its planned modifications to its generating facilities to determine the potential applicability of new source review and similar regulations.
In December 2011, the company filed its proposed plan to comply with revised New York State nitrogen oxides reasonably available control technology regulations (NOx RACT) and is incorporating the plan provisions into its existing air quality permits as they are renewed. In 2011, the EPA adopted regulations establishing maximum achievable control technology standards for utility and industrial boilers. The regulations apply to major air emissions sources, including CECONYs generating facilities. CECONY complied with these regulations in 2014, and expects to comply with them in 2015 For information about the companys generating facilities, see CECONY  Electric Operations  Electric Facilities and Steam Operations  Steam Facilities above in this Item1.
In October 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted its stay of the Transport Rule (also referred to as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule). The appellate court acted on remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, which in April 2014 reversed the appellate courts August 2012 decision that vacated the rule. The Transport Rule establishes a new cap and trade program requiring further reductions in air emissions than the Clean Air Intrastate Rule (CAIR) that it replaces.Under the Transport Rule, utilities are to be allocated emissions allowances and may sell the allowances or buy additional allowances. CECONY requested and received NYSPSC approval to change the provisions under which the company recovers its purchased power costs to provide for costs incurred to purchase emissions allowances and revenues received from the sale of allowances. Until the Transport Rule was implemented in January 2015, CAIR remained in effect. CECONY complied with CAIR in 2014 and expects to comply with the Transport Rule in 2015.
State Anti-Takeover Law New York State law provides that a domestic corporation, such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporations board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent fair price formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.
Employees Con Edison has no employees other than those of CECONY, O&R and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses (which at December31, 2014 had 13,200, 1,103 and 298 employees, respectively). Of the 13,200 CECONY employees and 1,103O&R employees, 8,136 and 594 were represented by a collective bargaining unit, respectively. The collective bargaining agreement covering most of these CECONY employees expires in June 2016. Agreements covering other CECONY employees and O&R employees expire in June 2017 and May 2017, respectively.
Available Information For the sources of information about the Companies, see Available Information in the Introduction appearing before this Item1.
Item1A: Risk Factors Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made.
The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies major risks include: Regulatory/Compliance Risks: The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties.
The Companies operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. See Note B to the financial statements in Item8. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could 32 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents adversely affect the Companies. In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its REV proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. See Utility Regulation and Environmental Matters  Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions in Item1 and Application of Critical Accounting Policies in Item7.
The Utilities Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return.
The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities cost of service (including a return on equity). See Utility Regulation  State Utility Regulation, Rate Plans in Item1 and Rate Plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see Other Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements in Item8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings.
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities Rate Plans.
The Utilities rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. In February 2014, the NYSPSC adopted a Joint Proposal with respect to CECONYs rates for electric, gas and steam delivery service in 2014 and 2015 (and, for gas and steam delivery service, 2016). See Rate Plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item8.
The Intentional Misconduct of Employees or Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies.
The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Such intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. See Employees in Item1 and Other Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements in Item8.
Operations Risks: The Failure of, or Damage to, the Companies Facilities Could Adversely Affect the Companies.
The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities facilities in Item1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. A natural disaster such as a major storm, a heat wave or hurricane could damage our facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See Other Regulatory Matters in Note B and Manhattan Steam Main Rupture and Manhattan Explosion and Fire in Note H to the financial statements in Item8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities liability for service interruptions. See Utility Regulation  State Utility Regulation in Item1.
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies.
The Utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses could have their operations disrupted, financial and other information systems impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact on the Companies.
Environmental Risks: The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations.
The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See Environmental Matters  Climate Change in Item1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See Environmental Matters  Other CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 33 Table of Contents Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions, Air Quality in Item1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters in Item1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established.
Financial and Market Risks: A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier Could Adversely Affect The Companies.
Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities energy supply in Item1. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses also depend on wholesale energy markets to supply electricity to their customers. See Competitive Energy Businesses in Item1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Companies energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities energy facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to meet their customers energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. In addition, see Financial and Commodity Market Risks in Item7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities.
The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Financial and Commodity Market Risks, in Item7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edisons Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries.
Con Edisons ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements in Item8.
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements.
The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $8 billion over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The competitive energy businesses are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that may require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See Capital Requirements and Resources in Item1.
Other Risks: The Companies Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment.
The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. Changes to public policy, regulation, tax policy, customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities energy delivery facilities and the competitive energy businesses renewable and energy infrastructure projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. See Utility Regulation  State Utility Regulation  Reforming the Energy Vision Proceeding and Competition in Item1.
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control.
The Companies results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage Company facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Under the rate plans, pension and other postretirement costs and certain other costs are reconciled to amounts reflected in rates for such costs. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Rate Plans in Note B to the financial statements in Item8). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations.

Other For Con Edison, Other also includes inter-company eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below.
The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
The principal factors affecting CECONYs liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.
58 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control in Item1A, and Capital Requirements and Resources in Item1.
Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Variance 2014 vs.
2013 2012 Variance 2013 vs.

The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but generally not net income. See Note B to the financial statements in Item8. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
The Companies cash flows from operating activities also reflect income tax payments. Cash paid by Con Edison for income taxes, net of any refunds received was $633 million, $69 million and $46 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively (including $748 million, $163 million and $62 million for CECONY in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively). The Companies had no current federal income tax liabilities for 2012 due primarily to deduction for costs incurred in connection with Superstorm Sandy and deductions under the bonus depreciation provisions of the federal tax code. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 has extended bonus depreciation provisions to assets placed in service before January 2014 (or, for certain types of assets, January 2015). In December 2014, President Obama signed into law the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 which extended bonus depreciation for another year through December31, 2014. As a result, Con Edison is requesting a refund of $224 million of 2014 estimated federal tax payments (including $128 million attributable to CECONY). See Note L to the financial statements in Item8.
Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans  CECONY Electric and Gas and O&R  Electric and Gas in Note B to the financial statements in Item8.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2014 for Con Edison and CECONY were $279 million higher and $213 million lower, respectively, than in 2013. The increase in net cash flows for Con Edison reflects primarily the decreased pension contributions ($303 million) in 2014. The decrease in net cash for CECONY reflects higher income tax payments ($585 million) in 2014, offset in part by decreased pension contributions ($286 million) in 2014. The Companies contributed $584 million and $887 million (of which $544 million and $830 million was contributed by CECONY) to the pension plan during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2013 for Con Edison and CECONY were $47 million lower and $297 million higher, respectively, than in 2012. The decrease in net cash flows for Con Edison reflects a special deposit the company made with federal and state tax agencies relating primarily to the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 59 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued the financial statements in Item8. The increase in net cash for CECONY reflects receipt of a property tax refund from the City of New York.
The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable  customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances.
The changes in regulatory assets principally reflect changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements in Item8.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $100 million higher and $113 million lower, respectively, in 2014 than in 2013. For Con Edison, the change reflects primarily the proceeds from the termination of the LILO transactions in 2013 ($200 million) and increased investments in renewable electric production projects ($108 million), offset by proceeds from sale relating to its solar electric production projects in 2014 ($108 million, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item8). In addition, the changes for Con Edison and CECONY reflect decreased utility construction expenditures in 2014.
Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $136 million and $459 million higher, respectively, in 2013 than in 2012. The changes for Con Edison and CECONY reflect increased utility construction expenditures in 2013. In addition, for Con Edison, the change reflects increased non-utility construction expenditures, offset by receipt of grants related to solar electric production projects, decreased investments in solar electric production projects and the proceeds from the termination of the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item8.
Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2014 for Con Edison and CECONY were $434 million and $168 million higher, respectively, than in 2013. Net cash flows from financing activities in 2013 for Con Edison and CECONY were $717 million and $461 million higher, respectively, than in 2012.
Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflect the following CECONY transactions: 2014  Issued $850 million of 4.45 percent 30-year debentures, $250 million of 3.30 percent 10-year debentures and $750 million of 4.625 percent 40-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes;  Redeemed at maturity $200 million of 4.70 percent 10-year debentures; and  Redeemed at maturity $275 million of 5.55 percent 5-year debentures.

2012  Issued $400 million 4.20 percent 30-year debentures, $239 million of the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to redeem all outstanding shares of its $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value); and  Redeemed at maturity $300 million 5.625 percent 10-year debentures.
O&R had no issuances of long-term debt in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
In 2013, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $219 million aggregate principal amount of 4.78 percent senior notes secured by certain of the companys California solar electric production projects. The notes have a weighted average life of 15 years and final maturity of 2037. In 2014, the company sold a 50 percent interest in the subsidiary. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item8.
Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance. The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the average daily balances for 2014, 2013 and 2012 for Con Edison and CECONY were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (Millionsof Dollars, except WeightedAverage Yield) Out- standing at Dec ember31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec ember31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec ember31 Daily average Con Edison $ 801 $ 899 $ 1,451 $ 901 $ 539 $ 144 CECONY $ 451 $ 765 $ 1,210 $ 598 $ 421 $ 123 Weighted average yield 0.4 % 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.3 % 60 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions.

Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at December31, 2014, compared with December31, 2013.
(Millions of Dollars) ConEdison 2014vs.2013 Variance CECONY 2014vs.2013 Variance Assets Regulatory asset  Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs $ 2,116 $ 1,999 Investments 355 24 Income taxes receivable 224 - Non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation (217 ) 1 Special deposits (319 ) $ (84 ) Liabilities Pension and retiree benefits $ 2,187 $ 2,040 Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits 610 425 Accrued taxes (404 ) - Regulatory Asset for Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Liability for Pension and Retiree Benefits The increase in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at December31, 2014, in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the years amortization of accounting costs. The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2014. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item8.
Investments and Non-Utility Property, Less Accumulated Depreciation The increase in investments and decrease in non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation for Con Edison primarily reflect the purchase and sale of interests in solar electric production projects. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item8.
Income Taxes Receivable The increase in income taxes receivable for Con Edison reflects the refund request filed with the IRS in January 2015. See Note L to the financial statements in Item8.
Special Deposits and Accrued Taxes The decreases in Con Edisons special deposits and accrued taxes reflect applying the deposits made in 2013 against the federal and state tax liabilities in 2014 that primarily related to settling the LILO transactions. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J to the financial statements in Item8.
Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits The increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits reflects primarily the timing of the deduction of expenditures for utility plant which resulted in amounts being collected from customers to pay income taxes in advance of when the income tax payments will be required. For Con Edison, the increase also reflects the accelerated deductions for expenditures and investment tax credits primarily related to its renewable electric production projects.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companies have interests in a number of non-consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) that are accounted for under the equity method. Aside from the guarantees issued by Con Edison Development discussed below, none of the Companies interests in VIEs meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. For information regarding the Companies VIEs, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edison Development issued two guarantees ($63 million maximum and $31 million maximum) on behalf of two entities in which it acquired a 50 percent interest in July 2013 and March 2014, respectively (see Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements in Item8). The entities were formed to develop, construct and operate solar electric production facilities with a cumulative capacity of 400 MW (AC). The guarantees were issued in connection with the construction of the solar electric production facilities. Con Edison Development is not the primary beneficiary of these entities since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the facilities is shared equally between Con Edison Development and a third party. No payments have been made nor are any expected to be made under the guarantees.
Regulatory Matters For information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item8.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 61 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item1A.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases.
Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules for regulated operations.
The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December31, 2014, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $9,304 million and $8,613 million, respectively.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item8 for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2014, 2013 and 2012.
The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moodys or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.
In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.
The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edisons and CECONYs current estimates for 2015 are increases, compared with 2014, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $148 million and $141million, respectively.
62 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued The following table illustrates the effect on 2015 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 63 $ 3 $ 66 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 59 $ 2 $ 61 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 27 $ 2 $ 29 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 26 $ 2 $ 28 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ - $ (5 ) $ (5 ) CECONY 1.00 % $ - $ (9 ) $ (9 ) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 609 $ 41 $ 650 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 573 $ 33 $ 606 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ - $ (21 ) $ (21 ) CECONY 1.00 % $ - $ (43 ) $ (43 ) A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2015, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.80 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $22 million and $20 million, respectively, in 2016.
Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.
The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2014 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2014 of $535 million and $43 million, respectively. In 2015, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $703 million and $53 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item8.
Accounting for Contingencies The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.
Accounting for Long-Lived Assets The accounting rules for property, plant and equipment require that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.
Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. See Note K to the financial statements in Item8. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
Goodwill was $429 million at December31, 2014, which consists of $406 million related to the O&R merger and $23million related to two energy services companies acquired by Con Edison Solutions and a gas storage company acquired by Con Edison Development. The most recent tests, which were CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 63 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued performed during 2014, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment tests relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. Estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for the energy services companies and gas storage company may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks below and Note O to the financial statements in Item8.
Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
Accounting for Leases The Companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. In accordance with the accounting rules, Con Edison accounted for Con Edison Developments two Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions as leveraged leases. At December31, 2012, the companys investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, was carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet included in Item8. In 2013, a court disallowed tax losses claimed by Con Edison relating to Con Edison Developments LILO transactions and the company subsequently terminated the transactions, resulting in charges to earnings of $95 million (after taxes of $63 million) and $1 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The transactions did not impact earnings in 2012. See Notes J and L to the financial statements in Item8.
Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December31, 2014, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would not result in material changes in annual interest expense. Under CECONYs current gas, steam and electric rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. Under O&Rs current New York rate plans, variations in actual tax-exempt (and under the gas rate plan, taxable) long-term debt interest expense are reconciled to the level set in rates.
Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2014, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $53 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $47 million is for CECONY and $6 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. These 64 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Continued businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2014 2013 (MillionsofDollars) Average for the period $ 1 $ 1 High 7 1 Low - - The competitive energy businesses compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. The stress test includes an assessment of the impact of volume changes on the portfolio because the businesses generally commit to sell their customers their actual requirements, an amount which is estimated when the sales commitments are made. The businesses limit the volume of commodity derivative instruments entered into relative to their estimated sale commitments to maintain net market price exposures to their estimated sale commitments within a certain percentage of maximum and minimum exposures.
Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. See Credit Exposure in Note O to the financial statements in Item8.
Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item8. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 58 percent equities and 42 percent fixed income and other securities. At December31, 2014, the pension plan investments consisted of 58 percent equity and 42 percent fixed income and other securities.
Environmental Matters For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters in Item1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item8.
Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.
Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item8.

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 67 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Con Edisons independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
/s/ John McAvoy John McAvoy Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ Robert Hoglund Robert Hoglund Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February19, 2015 68 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ConsolidatedEdison, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) at December31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

78 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form10-K.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

88 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements General These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the separate consolidated financial statements of each of the two separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (CECONY). CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, which are presented separately in the CECONY consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Con Edisons other utility subsidiary, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses (discussed below) in Con Edisons consolidated financial statements. The term Utilities is used in these notes to refer to CECONY and O&R.
As used in these notes, the term Companies refers to Con Edison and CECONY and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, CECONY makes no representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.
Con Edison has two regulated utility subsidiaries: CECONY and O&R. CECONY provides electric service and gas service in NewYork City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. Con Edison has the following competitive energy businesses: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a company which sells to retail customers electricity purchased in wholesale markets and enters into related hedging transactions and also provides energy-related products and services to retail customers; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a company that provides energy-related products and services to wholesale customers; and Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that develops, owns and operates renewable and energy infrastructure projects. In addition, in 2014 Con Edison formed Consolidated Edison Transmission LLC (Con Edison Transmission) to invest in a transmission company. See information about Con Edison Transmission under Guarantees in Note H.
Note A  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Companies consolidated financial statements include the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (see Note Q), as required. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state regulators having jurisdiction.
The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules for regulated operations.
The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state regulators.
Other significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced below in this Note A and in the notes that follow.
Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The original cost of property is CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 89 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement, the original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation. See Note R.
Rates used for AFUDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate of return on the Utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC or the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the Utilities own funds are credited to other income (deductions). The AFUDC rates for CECONY were 1.6 percent, 4.0 percent and 6.5 percent for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The AFUDC rates for O&R were 2.6 percent, 5.7 percent and 7.0 percent for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The Utilities generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors. The average depreciation rates for CECONY were 3.1 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The average depreciation rates for O&R were 2.9 percent, 2.8 percent and 2.9 percent for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The estimated lives for utility plant for CECONY range from 5 to 85 years for electric and gas, 5 to 80 years for steam and 5 to 55years for general plant. For O&R, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 75 years for electric and gas and 5 to 50 years for general plant.
At December31, 2014 and 2013, the capitalized cost of the Companies utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, was as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Electric Generation $ 451 $ 452 $ 451 $ 452 Transmission 2,956 2,776 2,744 2,597 Distribution 16,361 15,277 15,531 14,496 Gas* 5,006 4,469 4,530 4,013 Steam 1,795 1,790 1,795 1,790 General 1,650 1,565 1,498 1,433 Held for future use 76 73 65 62 Construction work in progress 1,031 1,393 971 1,303 Net Utility Plant $ 29,326 $ 27,795 $ 27,585 $ 26,146 * Primarily distribution.
Under the Utilities rate plans, the aggregate annual depreciation allowance in effect at December31, 2014 was $1,048 million, including $993 million under CECONYs electric, gas and steam rate plans that have been approved by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC).
Non-Utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For Con Edison, non-utility plant consists primarily of the competitive energy businesses renewable electric production and gas storage. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists of land and conduit for telecommunication use. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 30 years.
Goodwill Con Edison tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. See Note K.
Impairments Con Edison evaluates the impairment of long-lived assets, based on projections of undiscounted future cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event an evaluation indicates that such cash flows cannot be expected to be sufficient to fully recover the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value. No impairment charges were recognized in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
Revenues The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for energy service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period net interruptible gas revenues, other than those authorized by the NYSPSC to be retained by the Utilities, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy service not yet billed to customers.
CECONYs electric and gas rate plans and O&Rs New York electric and gas rate plans each contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which the companys actual energy delivery revenues are compared with the authorized delivery revenues 90 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued and the difference accrued, with interest, for refund to, or recovery from, customers, as applicable. See Rate Plans in Note B.
The NYSPSC requires utilities to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is generally provided for in the revenue requirement within each of the respective NYSPSC approved rate plans. Total excise taxes (inclusive of gross receipts taxes) recorded in operating revenues were as follows: FortheYearsEndedDecember31, (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 Con Edison $ 365 $ 354 $ 334 CECONY 343 329 306 Recoverable Energy Costs The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility regulators. If the actual energy supply costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference in most cases is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed electric and steam supply costs and costs of its electric demand management programs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). For the Utilities gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a subsequent 12-month period.
New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) The Utilities purchase electricity through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The difference between purchased power and related costs initially billed to the Utilities by the NYISO and the actual cost of power subsequently calculated by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities customers.
Certain other payments to or receipts from the NYISO are also subject to reconciliation, with shortfalls or amounts in excess of specified rate allowances recoverable from or refundable to customers. These include proceeds from the sale through the NYISO of transmission rights on CECONYs transmission system (transmission congestion contracts or TCCs).
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly-liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses, which are accounted for under the equity method (depending on the subsidiaries percentage ownership). Utilities investments are recorded at fair value and include the investments of the deferred income plan and the supplemental retirement income plan in trust-owned life insurance assets.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The accounting rules for retirement benefits require an employer to recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For a pension plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation. For any other postretirement benefit plan, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The accounting rules generally require employers to recognize all unrecognized prior service costs and credits and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax. Such amounts will be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost or income pursuant to the current recognition and amortization provisions.
For the Utilities pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. Unrecognized prior service costs or credits and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recorded to regulatory assets or liabilities, rather than OCI. See Notes E and F.
The net periodic benefit costs are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. Investment gains and losses are recognized in expense over a 15-year period and other actuarial gains and losses are recognized in expense over a 10-year period, subject to the deferral provisions in the rate plans.
In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between such expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. Generally, O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its rate plans. See Note B  Regulatory Matters.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 91 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The Companies calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year. The accounting rules allow the MRV of plan assets to be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. The Companies use a calculated value when determining the MRV of the plan assets that adjusts for 20 percent of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. This calculated value has the effect of stabilizing variability in assets to which the Companies apply the expected return.
Federal Income Tax In accordance with the accounting rules for income taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate plans, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or turn-around of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense. See Notes B and L. In 1993, the NYSPSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with the accounting rules for income taxes and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates. See Note L.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays or receives an amount based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements among the members of the consolidated group. Tax loss carryforwards are allocated among members in accordance with consolidated tax return regulations.
State Income Tax Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each members share of the New York State tax is based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
Research and Development Costs Generally research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs were as follows: FortheYearsEndedDecember31, (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 Con Edison $ 22 $ 18 $ 21 CECONY 20 16 19 Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Earnings Per Common Share Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share (EPS) are calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders (Net income for common stock on Con Edisons consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.
Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and stock options for which the average market price of the common shares for the period was greater than the exercise price. See Note M.
92 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Basic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows: For the Years Ended December31, (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts/Shares in Millions) 2014 2013 2012 Net income for common stock $ 1,092 $ 1,062 $ 1,138 Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic 292.9 292.9 292.9 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities 1.1 1.5 1.6 Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding  Diluted 294.0 294.4 294.5 Net Income for common stock per common share  basic $ 3.73 $ 3.62 $ 3.88 Net Income for common stock per common share  diluted $ 3.71 $ 3.61 $ 3.86 The computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 exclude immaterial amounts of performance share awards that were not included because of their anti-dilutive effect.
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income by Component Changes to accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) for Con Edison and CECONY are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison CECONY Accumulated OCI, net of taxes, at December31, 2012 $ (53 ) $ (9 ) OCI before reclassifications, net of tax of $(15) and $(1) for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively 21 2 Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI related to pension plan liabilities, net of tax of $(5) and $(1) for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively(a)(b) 7 1 Total OCI, net of taxes, at December31, 2013 28 3 Accumulated OCI, net of taxes, at December31, 2013(b) $ (25 ) $ (6 ) OCI before reclassifications, net of tax of $18 and $4 for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively (26 ) (6 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI related to pension plan liabilities, net of tax of $(4) and $(1) for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively(a)(b) 6 1 Total OCI, net of taxes, at December31, 2014 (20 ) (5 ) Accumulated OCI, net of taxes, at December31, 2014(b) $ (45 ) ($ 11 ) (a) For the portion of unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs relating to the regulated Utilities, costs are recorded into, and amortized out of, regulatory assets instead of OCI. The net actuarial losses and prior service costs recognized during the period are included in the computation of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. See Notes E and F.
(b) Tax reclassified from accumulated OCI is reported in the income tax expense line item of the income statement.
Note B  Regulatory Matters Rate Plans The Utilities provide service to New York customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the NYSPSC. Tariffs for service to customers of O&Rs New Jersey and Pennsylvania regulated utility subsidiaries are approved by utility regulators in those states. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the Utilities to amounts that recover from their customers costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, there generally can be no change to the charges to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans. The Utilities rate plans each cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 93 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Common provisions of the Utilities rate plans include: Recoverable energy costs that allow the Utilities to recover on a current basis the costs for the energy they supply with no mark-up to their full-service customers.
Cost reconciliations that reconcile pension and other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs, property taxes, variable rate tax-exempt debt and certain other costs to amounts reflected in delivery rates for such costs. Utilities generally retain the right to petition for recovery or accounting deferral of extraordinary and material cost increases for items such as major storm events and provision is sometimes made for the utility to retain a share of cost reductions, for example, property tax refunds.
Revenue decoupling mechanisms that reconcile actual energy delivery revenues to the authorized delivery revenues approved by the NYSPSC. The difference is accrued with interest for refund to, or recovery from customers, as applicable.
Earnings sharing that require the Utilities to defer for customer benefit a portion of earnings over specified rates of return on common equity. There is no symmetric mechanism for earnings below specified rates of return on common equity.
Negative revenue adjustments for failure to meet certain performance standards relating to service, reliability, safety and other matters.
Net utility plant reconciliations that require deferral as a regulatory liability of the revenue requirement impact of the amount, if any, by which actual average net utility plant balances are less than amounts reflected in rates.
Rate base is, in general, the sum of the Utilities net plant and working capital less deferred taxes. For each rate plan, the NYSPSC uses a forecast of the average rate base for each year that new rates would be in effect (rate year).The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) use the rate base balances that would exist at the beginning of the rate year.
Weighted average cost of capital is determined based on the authorized common equity ratio, return on common equity, cost of long-term debt and customer deposits reflected in each rate plan. For each rate plan, the revenues designed to provide the utility a return on invested capital for each rate year is determined by multiplying the Utilities rate base by the utilitys pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. The Utilities actual return on common equity will reflect their actual operations for each rate year, and may be more or less than the authorized return on equity reflected in their rate plans (and if more, may be subject to earnings sharing).

Other Regulatory Matters In February 2009, the NYSPSC commenced a proceeding to examine the prudence of certain CECONY expenditures following the arrests of employees for accepting illegal payments from a construction contractor. Subsequently, additional employees were arrested for accepting illegal payments from materials suppliers and an engineering firm. The arrested employees were terminated by the company and have pled guilty or been convicted. Pursuant to NYSPSC orders, a portion of the companys revenues (currently, $249 million, $32 million and $6 million on an annual basis for electric, gas and steam service, respectively) is being collected subject to potential refund to customers. The amount of electric revenues collected subject to refund, which was established in a different proceeding, and the amount of gas and steam revenues collected subject to refund were not established as indicative of the companys potential liability in this proceeding. At December31, 2014, the company had collected an estimated $1,675 million from customers subject to potential refund in connection with this proceeding. In January 2013, a NYSPSC consultant reported its estimate, with which the company does not agree, of $208 million of overcharges with respect to a substantial portion of the companys construction expenditures from January 2000 to January 2009. The company is disputing the consultants estimate, including its determinations as to overcharges regarding specific construction expenditures it selected to review and its methodology of extrapolating such determinations over a substantial portion of the construction expenditures during this period. The NYSPSCs consultant has not reviewed the companys other expenditures. The company and NYSPSC staff are exploring a settlement in this proceeding. There is no assurance that there will be a settlement, and any settlement would be subject to NYSPSC approval. At December31, 2014, the company had a $105million regulatory liability relating to this matter. The company currently estimates that any additional amount the NYSPSC requires the company to refund to customers in excess of the regulatory liability accrued could range up to an amount based on the NYSPSC consultants $208 million estimate of overcharges.
In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities electric distribution system and interrupted service to approximately 1.4million customers. Superstorm Sandy also damaged CECONYs steam system and interrupted service to many of its steam customers. As of December31, 2014, CECONY and O&R incurred response and restoration costs forSuperstorm Sandy of $503 million and $91 million, respectively (including capital expenditures of $148 million and $15 million, respectively). Most of the costs that were not capitalized were deferred for recovery as a regulatory asset under the Utilities electric rate plans. See Regulatory Assets and Liabilities below. CECONYs current electric rate plan includes collection from customers of deferred storm costs (including for Superstorm Sandy), subject to refund following NYSPSC review of the costs. In November 2014, O&R requested recovery of deferred storm costs for its New York electric operations, which are subject to NYSPSC review. RECOs current electric rate plan includes collection from customers of deferred storm costs. See Rate Plans above.
In June 2014, the NYSPSC initiated a proceeding to investigate the practices of qualifying persons to perform plastic fusions on gas facilities. New York State regulations require gas utilities to qualify and, except in certain circumstances, annually requalify workers that perform fusion to join plastic pipe. The NYSPSC CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 99 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued directed the New York gas utilities to provide information in this proceeding about their compliance with the qualification and requalification requirements and related matters; their procedures for compliance with all gas safety regulations; and their annual chief executive officer certifications regarding these and other procedures. CECONYs qualification and requalification procedures had not included certain required testing to evaluate specimen fuses. In addition, CECONY and O&R had not timely requalified certain workers that had been qualified under their respective procedures to perform fusion to join plastic pipe. CECONY and O&R have requalified their workers who perform plastic pipe fusions. In October 2014, CECONY and O&R submitted for NYSPSC staff review their plans for testing plastic pipe fusions that were performed on their gas delivery systems, additional leakage surveying and reporting.

See Note A.
Deferred storm costs represent response and restoration costs, other than capital expenditures, in connection with Superstorm Sandy and other major storms that were deferred by the Utilities. See Other Regulatory Matters, above.
Net electric deferrals represents the remaining unamortized balance of certain regulatory assets and liabilities of CECONY that were combined effective April1, 2010 and are being amortized to income over a ten-year period.
Revenue taxes represents the timing difference between taxes collected and paid by the Utilities to fund mass transportation.
Effective March31, 2009, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY to accrue unbilled electric, gas and steam revenues. CECONY has deferred the net margin on the unbilled revenues for the future benefit of customers by recording a regulatory liability of $138 million and $133 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for the difference between the unbilled revenues and energy cost liabilities.
Note C  Capitalization Common Stock At December31, 2014 and 2013, Con Edison owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. CECONY owns 21,976,200 shares of Con Edison stock, which it purchased prior to 2001 in connection with Con Edisons stock repurchase plan. CECONY presents in the financial statements the cost of the Con Edison stock it owns as a reduction of common shareholders equity.
Capitalization of Con Edison The outstanding capitalization for each of the Companies is shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization, and for Con Edison includes the Utilities outstanding debt.
Preferred Stock of CECONY In May 2012, CECONY redeemed all of its outstanding shares of $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value).
Dividends In accordance with NYSPSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities generally pay are limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of income available for dividends are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiarys equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.
Long-term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2015-2019 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison CECONY 2015 $ 560 $ 350 2016 731 650 2017 6 - 2018 1,260 1,200 2019 540 475 The Utilities have issued $494 million of tax-exempt debt through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) that currently bear interest at a rate determined weekly and is subject to tender by bondholders for purchase by the Utilities.
The carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt at December31, 2014 and 2013 are: (MillionsofDollars) 2014 2013 Long-Term Debt (including current portion) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Con Edison $ 12,191 $ 13,998 $ 10,974 $ 12,082 CECONY $ 11,214 $ 12,846 $ 9,841 $ 10,797 Fair values of long-term debt have been estimated primarily using available market information. For Con Edison, $13,362 million and $636 million of the fair value of long-term debt at December31, 2014 are classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. For CECONY, $12,210 million and $636 million of the fair value of long-term debt at December31, 2014 are classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively (see Note P). The $636 million of long-term debt classified as Level 3 is CECONYs tax-exempt, auction-rate securities for which the market is highly illiquid and there is a lack of observable inputs.
At December31, 2014 and 2013, long-term debt of Con Edison included $18 million and $22 million, respectively, of Transition Bonds issued in 2004 by O&Rs New Jersey utility subsidiary through a special purpose entity.
Significant Debt Covenants The significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the notes of Con Edison and the debentures of CECONY are obligations to pay principal and interest when due, covenants not 102 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met and, for Con Edisons notes, covenants that Con Edison shall continue its utility business in New York City and shall not permit Con Edisons ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capital to exceed 0.675 to 1. Con Edisons notes are also subject to cross default provisions with respect to other indebtedness of Con Edison or its material subsidiaries having a then outstanding principal balance in excess of $100 million. CECONYs debentures have no cross default provisions. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to covenants for the CECONY debentures discussed above and the covenants discussed below. The Companies were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at December31, 2014.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The arrangements include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default for the debt to which such provisions applied.
The failure to comply with debt covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default for the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied and, in the case of the Con Edison notes, a make-whole premium might and, in the case of certain events of default would, become due and payable immediately.
The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($150 million or $100 million for CECONY, depending on the facility).
Note D  Short-Term Borrowing In October 2011, Con Edison and the Utilities entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement), under which banks are committed to provide loans and letters of credit on a revolving credit basis. The Credit Agreement, as amended in 2013, expires in October 2017. There is a maximum of $2.25 billion of credit available through October 2016 and approximately $2.1 billion of credit available from then through October 2017. The full amount is available to CECONY and $1 billion is available to Con Edison, including up to $1.2 billion of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement supports the Companies commercial paper programs. The Companies have not borrowed under the Credit Agreement. At December31, 2014, Con Edison had $800 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $450 million was outstanding under CECONYs program. The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2014 was 0.4 percent for both Con Edison and CECONY. At December31, 2013, Con Edison had $1,451 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $1,210 million was outstanding under CECONYs program. The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2013 was 0.2 percent for both Con Edison and CECONY. At December31, 2014 and 2013, no loans were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and $11 million (including $11 million for CECONY) and $26 million (including $11 million for CECONY) of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
The banks commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no event of default. The commitments are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change. Upon a change of control of, or upon an event of default by one of the Companies, the banks may terminate their commitments with respect to that company, declare any amounts owed by that company under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and require that company to provide cash collateral relating to the letters of credit issued for it under the Credit Agreement. Events of default include the exceeding at any time of a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital of 0.65 to 1 (at December31, 2014 this ratio was 0.51 to 1 for Con Edison and CECONY); having liens on its assets in an aggregate amount exceeding five percent of its consolidated total capital, subject to certain exceptions; and the failure, following any applicable notice period, to meet certain other customary covenants. Interest and fees charged for the revolving credit facilities and any loans made or letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reflect the Companies respective credit ratings. The Companies were in compliance with their covenants at December31, 2014.
See Note S for information about short-term borrowing between related parties.
Note E  Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of CECONY and O&R and certain employees of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In addition, Con Edison maintains additional non-qualified supplemental pension plans.

For Con Edison, this increase in pension liability resulted in an increase to regulatory assets of $2,101 million for unrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with the Utilities consistent with the accounting rules for regulated operations, and a charge to OCI of $17 million (net of taxes) for the unrecognized net losses, and an immaterial change to OCI (net of taxes) for the unrecognized prior service costs associated with the competitive energy businesses and O&Rs New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries.
104 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued For CECONY, the increase in pension liability resulted in an increase to regulatory assets of $1,992 million for unrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs consistent with the accounting rules for regulated operations, a debit to OCI of $3 million (net of taxes) for unrecognized net losses, and an immaterial change to OCI (net of taxes) for the unrecognized prior service costs associated with the competitive energy businesses.
A portion of the unrecognized net loss and prior service cost for the pension plan, equal to $783 million and $4 million, respectively, will be recognized from accumulated OCI and the regulatory asset into net periodic benefit cost over the next year for Con Edison. Included in these amounts are $740 million and $2 million, respectively, for CECONY.
At December31, 2014 and 2013, Con Edisons investments include $225 million and $201 million, respectively, held in external trust accounts for benefit payments pursuant to the supplemental retirement plans. Included in these amounts for CECONY were $208 million and $183 million, respectively. See Note P. The accumulated benefit obligations for the supplemental retirement plans for Con Edison and CECONY were $289 million and $250 million as of December31, 2014 and $234 million and $199 million as of December31, 2013, respectively.
Assumptions The actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31: Discount rate 3.90 % 4.80 % 4.10 % Rate of compensation increase CECONY 4.25 % 4.35 % 4.35 % O&R 4.00 % 4.25 % 4.25 % Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31: Discount rate 4.80 % 4.10 % 4.70 % Expected return on plan assets 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % Rate of compensation increase CECONY 4.35 % 4.35 % 4.35 % O&R 4.25 % 4.25 % 4.25 % The expected return assumption reflects anticipated returns on the plans current and future assets. The Companies expected return was based on an evaluation of the current environment, market and economic outlook, relationships between the economy and asset class performance patterns, and recent and long-term trends in asset class performance. The projections were based on the plans target asset allocation.
Discount Rate Assumption To determine the assumed discount rate, the Companies use a model that produces a yield curve based on yields on selected highly rated (Aa or higher by either Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) or Standard& Poors) corporate bonds. Bonds with insufficient liquidity, bonds with questionable pricing information and bonds that are not representative of the overall market are excluded from consideration. For example, the bonds used in the model cannot be callable, they must have a price between 50 percent and 200 percent of the original price, the yield must lie between 1 percent and 20 percent, and the amount of the bond issue outstanding must be in excess of $50 million. The spot rates defined by the yield curve and the plans projected benefit payments are used to develop a weighted average discount rate.
Expected Benefit Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years: (Millions of Dollars) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020-2024 Con Edison $ 592 $ 615 $ 636 $ 658 $ 678 $ 3,642 CECONY 552 574 594 613 632 3,388 Expected Contributions Based on estimates as of December31, 2014, the Companies expect to make contributions to the pension plan during 2015 of $756 million (of which $703 million is to be contributed by CECONY). The Companies policy is to fund the total periodic benefit cost of the qualified plan to the extent tax deductible and to also contribute to the non-qualified plans.
Plan Assets The asset allocations for the pension plan at the end of 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the target allocation for 2015 are as follows: Target AllocationRange PlanAssetsatDecember31, Asset Category 2015 2014 2013 2012 EquitySecurities 55%-65% 58 % 60 % 60 % Debt Securities 27%-33% 32 % 30 % 31 % Real Estate 8%-12% 10 % 10 % 9 % Total 100% 100 % 100 % 100 % Con Edison has established a pension trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries and payment of plan expenses.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 105 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Pursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edisons Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) has general oversight responsibility for Con Edisons pension and other employee benefit plans. The pension plans named fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers.
The investment objectives of the Con Edison pension plan are to maintain a level and form of assets adequate to meet benefit obligations to participants, to achieve the expected long-term total return on the trust assets within a prudent level of risk and maintain a level of volatility that is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys expected contribution and expense or the Companys ability to meet plan obligations. The assets of the plan have no significant concentration of risk in one country (other than the United States), industry or entity.
The strategic asset allocation is intended to meet the objectives of the pension plan by diversifying its funds across asset classes, investment styles and fund managers. An asset/liability study typically is conducted every few years to determine whether the current strategic asset allocation continues to represent the appropriate balance of expected risk and reward for the plan to meet expected liabilities. Each study considers the investment risk of the asset allocation and determines the optimal asset allocation for the plan. The target asset allocation for 2015 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2011.
Individual fund managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Con Edison management regularly monitors, and the named fiduciaries review and report to the Committee regarding, asset class performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines. Management changes fund managers and rebalances the portfolio as appropriate. At the direction of the named fiduciaries, such changes are reported to the Committee.
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below under a three-level hierarchy as defined by the accounting rules for fair value measurements (see Note P).

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 107 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending net balances for assets at December31, 2013 classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The revised tables reflect the RP-2014 mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014, as adjusted based on the actual experience of the Companies. The new tables incorporate substantial life expectancy improvements relative to the last tables published in 2000 (RP-2000). As a result of the adoption, Con Edison recognized an increase in its pension benefit obligation of approximately $800 million as of December31, 2014. The Companies, under their current New York rate plans, defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, the differences between the actual level of expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits and amounts for those expenses reflected in rates.
Note F  Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities currently have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses.
CECONY also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. O&R has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees. Certain employees of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses are eligible to receive benefits under these programs.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost The components of the Companies net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Service cost $ 19 $ 23 $ 26 $ 15 $ 18 $ 21 Interest cost on accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation 60 54 73 52 46 63 Expected return on plan assets (77 ) (77 ) (85 ) (68 ) (68 ) (75 ) Recognition of net actuarial loss 57 65 98 51 57 87 Recognition of prior service cost (19 ) (27 ) (21 ) (15 ) (23 ) (18 ) Recognition of transition obligation - - 2 - - 2 NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ 40 $ 38 $ 93 $ 35 $ 30 $ 80 Cost capitalized (15 ) (15 ) (32 ) (14 ) (12 ) (28 ) Reconciliation to rate level 10 58 20 2 50 16 Cost charged to operating expenses $ 35 $ 81 $ 81 $ 23 $ 68 $ 68 108 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Funded Status The funded status of the programs at December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,395 $ 1,454 $ 1,756 $ 1,198 $ 1,238 $ 1,511 Service cost 19 23 26 15 18 21 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 60 54 73 52 46 63 Amendments (12 ) - (127 ) - - (89 ) Net actuarial loss/(gain) 47 (42 ) (175 ) 28 (20 ) (178 ) Benefits paid and administrative expenses (134 ) (136 ) (146 ) (125 ) (126 ) (134 ) Participant contributions 36 38 37 35 38 36 Medicare prescription subsidy - 4 10 - 4 8 BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR $ 1,411 $ 1,395 $ 1,454 $ 1,203 $ 1,198 $ 1,238 CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 1,113 $ 1,047 $ 947 $ 977 $ 922 $ 840 Actual return on plan assets 59 153 124 54 134 109 Employer contributions 7 9 83 7 9 71 EGWP payments 12 8 - 11 7 - Participant contributions 36 38 37 35 38 36 Benefits paid (143 ) (142 ) (144 ) (134 ) (133 ) (134 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR $ 1,084 $ 1,113 $ 1,047 $ 950 $ 977 $ 922 FUNDED STATUS $ (327 ) $ (282 ) $ (407 ) $ (253 ) $ (221 ) $ (316 ) Unrecognized net loss $ 78 $ 70 $ 251 $ 45 $ 54 $ 197 Unrecognized prior service costs (71 ) (78 ) (105 ) (46 ) (61 ) (84 ) In 2012, the Utilities amended their postretirement life and health benefit plans for management employees, resulting in a reduction to the obligation of $102 million. Also in 2012, the Utilities amended the retiree contributions for supplemental postretirement life insurance for CECONY management and weekly retirees, resulting in a reduction to the obligation of $25 million. Also in 2012, the Utilities elected to change the method of receiving the subsidy under Medicare Part D for retiree prescription drug coverage from the Retiree Drug Subsidy to the Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) beginning in January 2013. Participation in the EGWP allows Con Edison to offer substantially the same postretirement benefits to eligible participants while increasing subsidy reimbursements received by the plans from the Federal Government. This change was effective January 2013 and, as a result, the Utilities recognized a reduction to their postretirement health benefit obligation of $306 million as of December31, 2012, which was recorded as an actuarial gain.
The increase in the other postretirement benefit plan obligation (due primarily to decreased discount rates) was the primary cause of the increased liability for other postretirement benefits at Con Edison and CECONY of $45 million and $32 million, respectively, compared with December31, 2013. For Con Edison, this increased liability resulted in an increase to regulatory assets of $14 million for unrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with the Utilities consistent with the accounting rules for regulated operations, and a charge to OCI of $3 million (net of taxes) for the unrecognized net losses and an immaterial change to OCI (net of taxes) for the unrecognized prior service costs associated with the competitive energy businesses and O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary.
For CECONY, the increase in liability resulted in an increase to regulatory assets of $6 million for unrecognized net losses and unrecognized prior service costs associated with the company consistent with the accounting rules for regulated operations, a debit to OCI of $2 million (net of taxes) for the unrecognized net losses and an immaterial change to OCI for unrecognized prior service costs associated with the competitive energy businesses.
A portion of the unrecognized net losses and prior service costs for the other postretirement benefits, equal to $33 million and $(20) million, respectively, will be recognized from CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 109 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued accumulated OCI and the regulatory asset into net periodic benefit cost over the next year for Con Edison. Included in these amounts are $29 million and $(14) million, respectively, for CECONY.
Assumptions The actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31: Discount Rate CECONY 3.75 % 4.50 % 3.75 % O&R 3.85 % 4.75 % 4.05 % Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31: Discount Rate CECONY 4.50 % 3.75 % 4.55 % O&R 4.75 % 4.05 % 4.55 % Expected Return on Plan Assets 7.75 % 7.75 % 8.50 % Refer to Note E for descriptions of the basis for determining the expected return on assets, investment policies and strategies and the assumed discount rate.
The health care cost trend rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December31, 2014 was 5.50 percent, which is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.50 percent by 2018 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate used to determine benefit obligations as of December31, 2014 was 5.25 percent, which is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.50 percent by 2018 and remain at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects at December31, 2015: Con Edison CECONY 1-Percentage-Point (Millions of Dollars) Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Effect on accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation $ (21 ) $ 40 $ (43 ) $ 57 Effect on service cost and interest cost components for 2014 (2 ) 1 (4 ) 3 Expected Benefit Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years, net of receipt of governmental subsidies: (Millions of Dollars) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020-2024 BENEFIT PAYMENTS Con Edison $ 99 $ 95 $ 94 $ 92 $ 89 $ 419 CECONY 89 85 84 82 79 364 Expected Contributions Based on estimates as of December31, 2014, Con Edison expects to make a contribution of $6 million, nearly all of which is for CECONY, to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2015.
Plan Assets The asset allocations for CECONYs other postretirement benefit plans at the end of 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the target allocation for 2015 are as follows: TargetAllocationRange Plan Assets at December31 Asset Category 2015 2014 2013 2012 Equity Securities 57%-73% 59 % 61 % 62% Debt Securities 26%-44% 41 % 39 % 38% Total 100% 100 % 100 % 100% Con Edison has established postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.

As a result of the adoption, Con Edison recognized an increase of less than $10 million in its other postretirement benefits obligation as of December31, 2014. The Companies, under their current New York rate plans, defer as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, the differences between the actual level of expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits and amounts for those expenses reflected in rates.
Note G  Environmental Matters Superfund Sites Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs (which include costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment, and monitoring) and natural resource damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas plant sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated, are referred to herein as Superfund Sites.
For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to investigate and, where determinable, discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas plant sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the companys share of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites, if remediation is necessary and if a reasonable estimate of such cost can be made. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.
The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites at December31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Accrued Liabilities: Manufactured gas plant sites $ 684 $ 665 $ 587 $ 562 Other Superfund Sites 80 84 79 82 Total $ 764 $ 749 $ 666 $ 644 Regulatory assets $ 925 $ 938 $ 820 $ 830 Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. However, for some of the sites, the extent and associated cost of the required remediation has not yet been determined. As investigations progress and information pertaining to the required remediation becomes available, the Utilities expect that additional liability may be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that in 2015 they will incur costs for remediation of approximately $39 million and $35 million, respectively. The Companies are unable to estimate the time period over which the remaining accrued liability will be incurred because, among other things, the required remediation has not been determined for some of the sites. Under their current rate plans, the Utilities are permitted to recover or defer as regulatory assets (for 112 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued subsequent recovery through rates) certain site investigation and remediation costs.
Environmental remediation costs incurred and insurance recoveries received related to Superfund Sites at December31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Remediation costs incurred $ 29 $ 41 $ 20 $ 35 Insurance recoveries received* 7 - 7 - * Reduced amount deferred for recovery from customers In 2014, Con Edison and CECONY estimated that for their manufactured gas plant sites (including CECONYs Astoria site), the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other environmental contaminants could range up to $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at all sites, including those that have not yet been fully investigated and additional assumptions about the extent of the contamination and the type and extent of the remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different.
Asbestos Proceedings Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. At December31, 2014 and 2013, Con Edison and CECONY had accrued their estimated aggregate undiscounted potential liabilities for these suits and additional suits that may be brought over the next 15 years of $8 million and $7 million, respectively. The estimates were based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Trial courts have begun, and unless otherwise determined by an appellate court may continue, to apply a different standard for determining liability in asbestos suits than the standard that applied historically. As a result, the Companies currently believe that there is a reasonable possibility of an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the suits. The Companies are unable to estimate the amount or range of such loss. In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Under its current rate plans, CECONY is permitted to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) costs incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers compensation claims. The accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for the Companies at December31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: ConEdison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Accrued liability  asbestos suits $ 8 $ 8 $ 7 $ 7 Regulatory assets  asbestos suits $ 8 $ 8 $ 7 $ 7 Accrued liability  workers compensation $ 83 $ 87 $ 78 $ 82 Regulatory assets  workers compensation $ 8 $ 12 $ 8 $ 12 Note H  Other Material Contingencies Manhattan Steam Main Rupture In July 2007, a CECONY steam main located in midtown Manhattan ruptured. It has been reported that one person died and others were injured as a result of the incident. Several buildings in the area were damaged. Debris from the incident included dirt and mud containing asbestos. The response to the incident required the closing of several buildings and streets for various periods. Approximately ninety suits are pending against the company seeking generally unspecified compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages, for personal injury, property damage and business interruption. The company has notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover the companys costs to satisfy its liability to others in connection with the suits. In the companys estimation, there is not a reasonable possibility that an exposure to loss exists for the suits that is materially in excess of the estimated liability accrued. At December31, 2014, the company has accrued its estimated liability for the suits of $50 million and an insurance receivable in the same amount.
Manhattan Explosion and Fire On March12, 2014, two multi-use five-story tall buildings located on Park Avenue between 116 th and 117 th Street in Manhattan were destroyed by an explosion and fire. CECONY had delivered gas to the buildings through service lines from a distribution main located below ground on Park Avenue. Eight people died and more than 48 people were injured. Additional buildings were also damaged. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The parties to the investigation include the company, the City of New York, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the NYSPSC (which is also conducting an investigation). Approximately thirty suits are CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 113 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued pending against the company seeking generally unspecified damages and, in one case, punitive damages, for personal injury, property damage and business interruption. The company has notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover the companys costs, in excess of a required retention (the amount of which is not material), to satisfy any liability it may have for damages in connection with the incident. The company is unable to estimate the amount or range of its possible loss related to the incident. At December31, 2014, the company had not accrued a liability for the incident.
Other Contingencies See Other Regulatory Matters in Note B.
Guarantees Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. Maximum amounts guaranteed by Con Edison totaled $2,547 million and $1,331 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
A summary, by type and term, of Con Edisons total guarantees at December31, 2014 is as follows: Guarantee Type 0  3 years 410 years > 10 years Total (Millions of Dollars) NY Transco $ 1,361 $ - $ - $ 1,361 Energy transactions 774 31 96 901 Renewable electric production projects 248 - 7 255 Other 30 - - 30 Total $ 2,413 $ 31 $ 103 $ 2,547 NY Transco  Con Edison has guaranteed payment by its subsidiary, Con Edison Transmission, of the contributions it agreed to make in New York Transco LLC (NY Transco). Con Edison Transmission acquired a 46 percentinterest in NY Transco when it was formed in 2014.NY Transcos transmission projects are expected to be developed initially by CECONY and other New York transmission owners and then sold to NY Transco. The development and sale of the projects would be subject to authorizations from the NYSPSC, FERC and other federal, state and local agencies. Guarantee amount shown is for the maximum possible required amount of Con Edison Transmissions contributions, which assumed that all the NY Transco projects proposed when NY Transco was formed receive all required regulatory approvals and are completed at 175 percent of their estimated costs and that NY Transco does not use any debt financing for the projects. Guarantee term shown is assumed as the timing of the contributions is not known.
Energy Transactions  Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its competitive energy businesses in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity, renewable energy credits and energy services. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet.
Renewable Electric Production Projects  Con Edison and Con Edison Development guarantee payments associated with the investment in solar and wind energy facilities on behalf of their wholly-owned subsidiaries. In addition, Con Edison Development has entered into two guarantees ($63 million maximum and $31 million maximum, respectively) on behalf of entities (Copper Mountain Solar 2 and Copper Mountain Solar 3, respectively) in which it has a 50 percent interest (see Note Q) in connection with the construction of solar energy facilities. Con Edison Development also provided $3 million in guarantees to Travelers Insurance Company for indemnity agreements for surety bonds in connection with the construction and operation of solar energy facilities performed by its subsidiaries.
Other  Other guarantees primarily relate to guarantees provided by Con Edison to Travelers Insurance Company for indemnity agreements for surety bonds in connection with energy service projects performed by Con Edison Solutions ($25 million). In addition, Con Edison issued a guarantee to the Public Utility Commission of Texas covering obligations of Con Edison Solutions as a retail electric provider. Con Edisons estimate of the maximum potential obligation for this guarantee is $5 million as of December31, 2014.

In accordance with the accounting rules for leases, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.
Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered from customers. The following assets under capital leases are included in the Companies consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2014 and 2013: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 UTILITY PLANT Common $ 3 $ 3 $ 1 $ 2 The accumulated amortization of the capital leases for Con Edison and CECONY was $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively at December31, 2014, and $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively at December31, 2013.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 115 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The future minimum lease commitments for the above assets are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison CECONY 2015 $ 1 $ 1 2016 1 1 2017 - - 2018 - - 2019 - - All years thereafter - - Total 2 2 Less: amount representing interest 1 1 Present value of net minimum lease payment $ 1 $ 1 Operating leases: The future minimum lease commitments under the Companies non-cancelable operating lease agreements are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison CECONY 2015 $ 18 $ 14 2016 17 13 2017 16 12 2018 16 12 2019 14 10 All years thereafter 72 51 Total $ 153 $ 112 Lease In/Lease Out Transactions In each of 1997 and 1999, Con Edison Development entered into transactions in which it leased property and then immediately subleased the properties back to the lessor (termed Lease In/Lease Out, or LILO transactions). The transactions respectively involved electric generating and gas distribution facilities in the Netherlands, with a total investment of $259million. The transactions were financed with $93 million of equity and $166 million of non-recourse, long-term debt secured by the underlying assets. In accordance with the accounting rules for leases, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, was carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income was recognized pursuant to a method that incorporated a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease was positive. At December31, 2012, the companys net investment in the LILO transactions was $(76)million, comprised of a $228 million gross investment less $304 million of deferred tax liabilities. During 2013, as discussed below, the company terminated its LILO transactions and at December31, 2013 no longer had an investment recorded for these leases in its consolidated balance sheet.
On audit of Con Edisons tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed tax losses in connection with the 1997 LILO transactions. In October 2009, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued a decision in favor of the company which, among other things, concluded that the tax losses claimed by the company were allowable. In January 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the October 2009 trial court decision. In June 2013, Con Edison entered into a closing agreement with the IRS regarding the 1997 and 1999 LILO transactions.
As a result of the January 2013 Court of Appeals decision, in 2013, Con Edison recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million to reflect, as required by the accounting rules for leveraged lease transactions, the recalculation of the accounting effect of the LILO transactions based on the revised after-tax cash flows projected from the inception of the leveraged leases as well as the interest on the potential tax liability resulting from the disallowance of federal and state income tax losses for the LILO transactions. Also, in 2013, the LILO transactions were terminated, as a result of which the company realized a $55 million gain (after-tax). In 2014, adjustments were made to the interest accrued on the liability and the related taxes resulting in a decrease to net income of $1 million.
The effect on Con Edisons consolidated income statement for the twelve months ended as of December31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows: FortheYearsEnded December31, (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Increase/(decrease) to non-utility operating revenues $ - $ (27 ) (Increase)/decrease to other interest expense 13 (131 ) Income tax benefit/(expense) (14) 63 Total increase/(decrease) in net income $(1) $(95) The transactions did not impact earnings in 2012.
In January 2013, to defray interest charges, the company deposited $447 million with federal and state tax agencies relating primarily to the potential tax liability from the LILO transactions in past tax years and interest thereon. During 2013, $125 million of the deposit was returned from the IRS at the companys request. Also in 2013, the deposit balance was reduced by an additional $48 million, due to a $10 million refund from the IRS and the application of $38 million toward the settlement of tax and interest for prior tax years, primarily relating to tax liability from the LILO transactions. In the first quarter of 116 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued 2014, Con Edison applied the remainder of the deposit against its federal and state tax liabilities, including interest, for other tax years.
Note K  Goodwill In 2014 and 2013, Con Edison completed impairment tests for its goodwill of $406 million related to the O&R merger, and determined that it was not impaired. For the impairment test, $245 million and $161 million of the goodwill were allocated to CECONY and O&R, respectively. In 2014 and 2013, Con Edison also completed impairment tests for the goodwill of $23 million related to two energy services companies acquired by Con Edison Solutions and a gas storage company acquired by Con Edison Development, and determined that the goodwill was not impaired. Estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates, and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for the energy services companies and gas storage company may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill.
Prior to 2014, Con Edison performed its annual goodwill impairment test on either January1 or December31. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Con Edison changed its annual goodwill impairment testing date from January1 and December31 to October1. This change is preferable under the circumstances as it aligns the timing of the annual goodwill impairment test with the strategic planning and budgeting process, which will allow Con Edison to utilize the updated strategic business plans that result from the budget process in the discounted cash flow analyses that it uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. This change does not accelerate, delay, avoid or cause an impairment charge, nor does this change result in adjustments to previously issued financial statements. The annual goodwill impairment testing was performed as of October1, 2014. Consideration was also given to the period between the testing date and December31, 2014, in order to conclude that no facts or circumstances have arisen that would lead to a different conclusion as of December31, 2014.
Note L  Income Tax The components of income tax are as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 State Current $ 59 $ 151 $ 29 $ 66 $ 111 $ 53 Deferred 61 (70 ) 97 65 (14 ) 53 Federal Current (9 ) 285 (13 ) 158 187 110 Deferred 463 115 493 271 241 318 Amortization of investment tax credits (6 ) (5 ) (6 ) (5 ) (5 ) (5 ) Total income tax expense $ 568 $ 476 $ 600 $ 555 $ 520 $ 529 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 117 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The tax effects of temporary differences, which gave rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Deferred tax liabilities: Property basis differences $ 7,510 $ 7,012 $ 6,938 $ 6,424 Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs 1,968 1,109 1,872 1,060 Regulatory asset  future income tax 910 871 863 825 Environmental remediation costs 376 381 333 337 Deferred storm costs 129 179 91 136 Equity investments Other regulatory assets 168 347 21 402 - 300 - 364 Unamortized investment tax credits 126 43 37 42 Total deferred tax liabilities and investment tax credits 11,534 10,018 10,434 9,188 Deferred tax assets: Accrued pension and other postretirement costs Regulatory liabilities 1,306 615 458 604 1,155 574 364 569 Superfund and other environmental costs 306 301 264 256 Asset retirement obligations 77 58 75 58 Loss carryforwards 21 12 - - Loss carryforwards, valuation reserve (11 ) (12 ) - - Other 272 253 203 209 Total deferred tax assets 2,586 1,674 2,271 1,456 Net deferred tax liabilities and investment tax credits $ 8,948 $ 8,344 $ 8,163 $ 7,732 Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits  noncurrent $ 9,076 $ 8,466 $ 8,257 $ 7,832 Deferred tax assets  current (128 ) (122 ) (94 ) (100 ) Net deferred tax liabilities and investment tax credits $ 8,948 $ 8,344 $ 8,163 $ 7,732 Reconciliation of the difference between income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the prevailing statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows: Con Edison CECONY (% of Pre-tax income) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 STATUTORY TAX RATE Federal 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % Changes in computed taxes resulting from: State income tax 5 4 4 5 5 4 Cost of removal (5 ) (5 ) (4 ) (5 ) (5 ) (4 ) Manufacturing deduction - (1 ) - - - - Other (1 ) (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Effective tax rate 34 % 31 % 34 % 34 % 34 % 34 % Con Edison has a net operating loss carryforward available from the years 1999 through 2014 for which a deferred tax asset of $21million has been recognized and will not expire until the years 2019 through 2034. An $11million valuation allowance for New York City income tax purpose has been provided; as it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.
In September 2013, the IRS issued final regulations, effective in 2014, that provide guidance on the appropriate tax treatment of costs incurred to acquire, produce or improve tangible property, as well as routine maintenance and repair costs. Proposed regulations were issued addressing the tax treatment of asset dispositions. The application of these regulations did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In March 2014, tax legislation was enacted in the State of New York that reduced the corporate franchise tax rate from 7.1 percent to 6.5 percent, beginning January1, 2016. The 118 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued application of this legislation decreased Con Edisons accumulated deferred tax liabilities by $74 million ($69 million for CECONY), decreased Con Edisons regulatory asset for future income tax by $11 million ($10 million for CECONY) and increased Con Edisons regulatory liability by $62 million ($59 million for CECONY). The impact of this tax legislation on Con Edisons effective tax rate was not material, and there was no impact on CECONYs effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2014.
Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, 50 percent bonus depreciation expired on December31, 2013. On December19, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which extended bonus depreciation for another year through December31, 2014. As a result of the extension of bonus depreciation to 2014, Con Edison filed a refund request with the IRS in January 2015 to recover $224 million ($128 million attributable to CECONY) in estimated federal tax payments.
Uncertain Tax Positions Under the accounting rules for income taxes, the Companies are not permitted to recognize the tax benefit attributable to a tax position unless such position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position.
In 2014 following the conclusion of its IRS audit, Con Edison filed amended state tax returns (primarily New York) for tax years 1998 through 2011. As a result of positions taken on the amended state tax returns, Con Edison increased its estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions by $27 million ($2 million attributable to CECONY). The amended returns contain uncertain tax positions unique to the states, and the returns remain open for examination. The federal tax returns for 2011 through 2013 remain open for examination. These changes to the Companies estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions had an immaterial impact on income tax expense for the year ended December31, 2014.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for Con Edison and CECONY follows: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Balance at January1, $ 9 $ 86 $ 130 $ - $ 74 $ 114 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year - 5 12 - - 11 Additions based on tax positions of prior years 27 253 - 2 - - Reductions for tax positions of prior years (2 ) (86 ) (57 ) - (74 ) (52 ) Settlements - (249 ) 1 - - 1 Balance at December31, $ 34 $ 9 $ 86 $ 2 $ - $ 74 As of December31, 2014, Con Edison reasonably expects to resolve approximately $26 million ($17 million, net of federal taxes) of its uncertainties related to certain tax matters within the next twelve months. Favorable resolution would reduce Con Edisons effective tax rate. The amount related to CECONY is approximately $2 million ($1 million, net of federal taxes), of which the entire amount, if recognized, would reduce CECONYs effective tax rate.
The Companies recognize interest on liabilities for uncertain tax positions in interest expense and would recognize penalties, if any, in operating expenses in the Companies consolidated income statements. In 2014 and 2012, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of interest and no penalties for uncertain tax positions in their consolidated income statements. In 2013, Con Edison recognized $121 million of interest expense ($131 million related to the LILO transactions (see Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note J), less a reduction of $10 million in accrued interest expense primarily associated with repair allowance deductions and reversing other uncertain tax positions in 2013). At December31, 2014 and 2013, the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of interest and no penalties in their consolidated balance sheets.
At December31, 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Companies effective tax rate is $34 million ($22 million, net of federal taxes) with $2 million ($1 million, net of federal taxes) attributable to CECONY.
Note M  Stock-Based Compensation The Companies may compensate employees and directors with, among other things, stock options, stock units, restricted stock units and contributions to the stock purchase plan. The CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 119 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Long Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by Con Edisons shareholders in 2003 (2003 LTIP), and the Long Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by Con Edisons shareholders in 2013 (2013 LTIP), are collectively referred to herein as the LTIP. The LTIP provides for, among other things, awards to employees of restricted stock units and stock options and, to Con Edisons non-employee directors, stock units. Existing awards under the 2003 LTIP continue in effect, however no new awards may be issued under the 2003 LTIP. The 2013 LTIP provides for awards for up to five million shares of common stock.
Shares of Con Edison common stock used to satisfy the Companies obligations with respect to stock-based compensation may be new (authorized, but unissued) shares, treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market. The Companies intend to use treasury shares and new shares to fulfill their stock-based compensation obligations for 2015.
Under the accounting rules for stock compensation, the Companies have recognized the cost of stock-based compensation as an expense using a fair value measurement method. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized by the Companies in the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: Con Edison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Performance-based restricted stock $ 22 $ 20 $ 14 $ 19 $ 18 $ 13 Time-based restricted stock 2 2 1 2 2 1 Non-employee director deferred stock compensation 2 2 1 2 2 1 Stock purchase plan 3 3 3 3 3 3 Total $ 29 $ 27 $ 19 $ 26 $ 25 $ 18 Income tax benefit $ 12 $ 11 $ 8 $ 10 $ 10 $ 7 Stock Options The Companies last granted stock options in 2006. The stock options generally vested over a three-year period and have a term of 10 years. Options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a common share when the option was granted. The Companies generally recognized compensation expense (based on the fair value of stock option awards) over the vesting period.
The outstanding options are equity awards because shares of Con Edison common stock are delivered upon exercise of the options. As equity awards, the fair value of the options is measured at the grant date.
A summary of changes in the status of stock options as of December31, 2014 is as follows: Con Edison CECONY Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at 12/31/13 481,310 $ 43.38 381,010 $ 43.34 Exercised (251,460 ) 43.75 (189,660 ) 43.68 Forfeited - - - - Outstanding at 12/31/14 229,850 $ 42.99 191,350 $ 43.00 Note: The weighted average remaining contractual life is one year for all outstanding options as of 12/31/14.
The following table summarizes information about stock options for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013: ConEdison CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Aggregate intrinsic value* Options outstanding $ 5 $ 6 $ 4 $ 5 Options exercised 4 2 3 2 Cash received by Con Edison for payment of exercise price 11 5 8 4 * Aggregate intrinsic value represents the changes in the fair value of all outstanding options from their grant dates to December31 of the years presented above.
120 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The income tax benefit Con Edison realized from stock options exercised in the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1 million, $10 million and an immaterial amount, respectively.
Restricted Stock and Stock Units Restricted stock and stock unit awards under the LTIP have been made as follows: (i)awards that provide for adjustment of the number of units (performance-restricted stock units or Performance RSUs) to certain officers and employees; (ii)time-based awards to certain employees; and (iii)awards to non-employee directors. Restricted stock and stock units awarded represents the right to receive, upon vesting, shares of Con Edison common stock, or, except for units awarded under the directors plan, the cash value of shares or a combination thereof.
The number of units in each annual Performance RSU award is subject to adjustment as follows: (i)50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 200 percent, based on Con Edisons total shareholder return relative to a specified peer group during a specified performance period (the TSR portion); and (ii)50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 120 percent for management employees and from 0 to 200 percent, based on determinations made in connection with the Companies annual incentive plans or, for certain executive officers, actual performance as compared to certain performance measures during a specified performance period (the non-TSR portion). Performance RSU awards generally vest upon completion of the performance period.
Performance against the established targets is recomputed each reporting period as of the earlier of the reporting date and the vesting date. The TSR portion applies a Monte Carlo simulation model, and the non-TSR portion is the product of the market price at the end of the period multiplied by the average non-TSR determination over the vesting period. Performance RSUs are liability awards because each Performance RSU represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. As such, changes in the fair value of the Performance RSUs are reflected in net income. The following table illustrates the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards: 2014 2013 2012 Risk-free interest rate(a) 0.23%-3.07% 0.13%-5.17% 0.15%-3.39% Expected term(b) 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected share price volatility(c) 13.14% 13.52% 15.27% (a) The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the date of grant.
(b) The expected term of the Performance RSUs equals the vesting period. The Companies do not expect significant forfeitures to occur.
(c) The expected volatility is calculated using daily closing stock prices over a period of three years, which approximates the expected term of the awards.
A summary of changes in the status of the Performance RSUs TSR and non-TSR portions during the year ended December31, 2014 is as follows: Con Edison CECONY Units Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue(a) Units Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue(a) TSR Portion(b) Non-TSR Portion(c) TSR Portion(b) Non-TSR Portion(c) Non-vested at 12/31/13 1,121,598 $ 49.32 $ 55.31 897,052 $ 49.38 $ 55.42 Granted 428,310 25.34 53.65 342,001 25.86 53.71 Vested (411,704 ) 43.84 50.05 (323,483 ) 43.93 50.08 Forfeited (37,597 ) 40.90 55.97 (35,047 ) 40.84 55.95 Non-vested at 12/31/14 1,100,607 $ 42.33 $ 56.61 880,523 $ 42.58 $ 56.70 (a) The TSR and non-TSR Portions each account for 50 percent of the awards value.
(b) Fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation described above. Weighted average grant date fair value does not reflect any accrual or payment of dividends prior to vesting.
(c) Fair value is determined using the market price of one share of Con Edison common stock on the grant date. The market price has not been discounted to reflect that dividends do not accrue and are not payable on Performance RSUs until vesting.
The total expense to be recognized by Con Edison in future periods for unvested Performance RSUs outstanding as of December31, 2014 is $25 million, including $19 million for CECONY and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year for both Con Edison and CECONY.
In accordance with the accounting rules for stock compensation, for time-based awards, the Companies have accrued a liability based on the market value of a common share on the grant date and are recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period. The vesting period for awards is three years and is based on the employees continuous service to Con Edison. Prior to vesting, the awards are subject to forfeiture in whole or in part under certain circumstances. The awards are liability awards because each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. As such, prior to vesting, changes in the fair value of the units are reflected CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 121 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued in net income. A summary of changes in the status of time-based awards during the year ended December31, 2014 is as follows: Con Edison CECONY Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Non-vested at 12/31/13 66,580 $ 56.92 63,030 $ 56.93 Granted 22,990 53.65 21,790 53.65 Vested (20,900 ) 50.74 (19,800 ) 50.75 Forfeited (3,247 ) 58.06 (2,847 ) 58.27 Non-vested at 12/31/14 65,423 $ 57.65 62,173 $ 57.64 The total expense to be recognized by Con Edison in future periods for unvested time-based awards outstanding as of December31, 2014 for Con Edison was $2 million, including $2 million for CECONY, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year.
Under the LTIP, each non-employee director receives stock units, which are deferred until the directors separation from service or another date specified by the director. Each director may also elect to defer all or a portion of their cash compensation into additional stock units, which are deferred until the directors termination of service or another date specified by the director. Non-employee directors stock units issued under the LTIP are considered equity awards, because they may only be settled in shares. Directors immediately vest in units issued to them. The fair value of the units is determined using the closing price of Con Edisons common stock on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue. In the year ended December31, 2014, approximately 37,972 units were issued at a weighted average grant date price of $55.51.
Stock Purchase Plan The Stock Purchase Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2004 and 2014, provides for the Companies to contribute up to $1 for each $9 invested by their directors, officers or employees to purchase Con Edison common stock under the plan. Eligible participants may invest up to $25,000 during any calendar year (subject to an additional limitation for officers and employees of not more than 20 percent of their pay). Dividends paid on shares held under the plan are reinvested in additional shares unless otherwise directed by the participant.
Participants in the plan immediately vest in shares purchased by them under the plan. The fair value of the shares of Con Edison common stock purchased under the plan was calculated using the average of the high and low composite sale prices at which shares were traded at the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding such purchase dates. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, 708,276, 864,281 and 665,718 shares were purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted average price of $56.23, $57.24 and $59.72 per share, respectively.
Note N  Financial Information by Business Segment The business segments of each of the Companies, which are its operating segments, were determined based on managements reporting and decision-making requirements in accordance with the accounting rules for segment reporting.
Con Edisons principal business segments are CECONYs regulated utility activities, O&Rs regulated utility activities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. CECONYs principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities.
All revenues of these business segments are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A.
Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 123 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Note O  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Con Edisons subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and steam by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, options, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. Derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value (See Note P), unless an exception is available under the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging. Qualifying derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts are not reported at fair value under the accounting rules.
The fair values of the Companies commodity derivatives including the offsetting of assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2014 and 2013 were: (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 Balance Sheet Location Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets/ (Liabilities) Gross Amounts Offset Net Amounts of Assets/ (Liabilities)(a) Gross Amounts of Recognized Assets/ (Liabilities) Gross Amounts Offset Net Amounts of Assets/ (Liabilities)(a) Con Edison Fair value of derivative assets Current $ 111 $ (67 ) $ 44 (b) $ 134 $ (77 ) $ 57 (b) Non-current 34 (23 ) 11 32 (24 ) 8 Total fair value of derivative assets $ 145 $ (90 ) $ 55 $ 166 $ (101 ) $ 65 Fair value of derivative liabilities Current $ (242 ) $ 139 $ (103 ) $ (82 ) $ 72 $ (10 ) Non-current (66 ) 91 25 (31 ) 26 (5 ) Total fair value of derivative liabilities $ (308 ) $ 230 $ (78 ) $ (113 ) $ 98 $ (15 ) Net fair value derivative assets/(liabilities) $ (163 ) $ 140 $ (23 )(b) $ 53 $ (3 ) $ 50 (b) CECONY Fair value of derivative assets Current $ 26 $ (15 ) $ 11 (b) $ 27 $ (19 ) $ 8 (b) Non-current 22 (20 ) 2 14 (13 ) 1 Total fair value of derivative assets $ 48 $ (35 ) $ 13 $ 41 $ (32 ) $ 9 Fair value of derivative liabilities Current $ (96 ) $ 48 $ (48 ) $ (32 ) $ 21 $ (11 ) Non-current liabilities (42 ) 32 (10 ) (19 ) 16 (3 ) Total fair value of derivative liabilities $ (138 ) $ 80 $ (58 ) $ (51 ) $ 37 $ (14 ) Net fair value derivative assets/(liabilities) $ (90 ) $ 45 $ (45 )(b) $ (10 ) $ 5 $ (5 )(b) (a) Derivative instruments and collateral were set off on the consolidated balance sheet as applicable under the accounting rules. The Companies enter into master agreements for their commodity derivatives. These agreements typically provide setoff in the event of contract termination. In such case, generally the non-defaulting partys payable will be set-off by the defaulting partys payable. The non-defaulting party will customarily notify the defaulting party within a specific time period and come to an agreement on the early termination amount.
(b) At December31, 2014 and 2013, margin deposits for Con Edison ($27 million and $17 million, respectively) and CECONY ($25 million and $16 million, respectively) were classified as derivative assets in the balance sheet, but not included in the table. Margin is collateral, typically cash, that the holder of a derivative instrument is required to deposit in order to transact on an exchange and to cover its potential losses with its broker or the exchange.
The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state utility regulators. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A. In accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the Utilities record a regulatory asset or liability to defer recognition of unrealized gains and losses on their electric and gas derivatives. As gains and losses are realized in future periods, they will be recognized as purchased power, gas and fuel costs in the Companies consolidated income statements. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses record realized and unrealized gains and losses on their derivative contracts in purchased power, gas purchased for resale and non-utility revenue in the reporting period in which they occur. Management believes that these derivative instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

The following table presents the hedged volume of Con Edisons and CECONYs derivative transactions at December31, 2014: ElectricEnergy(MWHs)(a)(b) Capacity(MWs)(a) NaturalGas(Dt)(a)(b) Con Edison 17,792,555 7,706 66,793,011 CECONY 5,543,250 2,100 62,065,000 (a) Volumes are reported net of long and short positions, except natural gas collars where the volumes of long positions are reported.
(b) Excludes electric congestion and gas basis swap contracts which are associated with electric and gas contracts and hedged volumes.
The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements, collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the Companies have a legally enforceable right of setoff.
At December31, 2014, Con Edison and CECONY had $148 million and $25 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, respectively. Con Edisons net credit exposure consisted of $79 million with commodity exchange brokers, $45 million with independent system operators, $20 million with investment-grade counterparties and $4 million with non-investment grade/non-rated counterparties. CECONYs net credit exposure was with commodity exchange brokers.
The collateral requirements associated with, and settlement of, derivative transactions are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies consolidated statement of cash flows. Most derivative instrument contracts contain provisions that may require a party to provide collateral on its derivative instruments that are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be provided will depend on the fair value of the derivative instruments and the partys credit ratings.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 125 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Companies derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position, the collateral posted for such positions and the additional collateral that would have been required to be posted had the lowest applicable credit rating been reduced one level and to below investment grade at December31, 2014: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison(a) CECONY(a) Aggregate fair value  net liabilities $ 78 $ 58 Collateral posted $ 1 $ - Additional collateral(b) (downgrade one level from current ratings) $ 6 $ 2 Additional collateral(b) (downgrade to below investment grade from current ratings) $ 105 (c) $ 63 (c) (a) Non-derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and gas and qualifying derivative instruments, which have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales, are excluded from the table. These transactions primarily include purchases of electricity from independent system operators. In the event the Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses were no longer extended unsecured credit for such purchases, the Companies would be required to post collateral, which at December31, 2014, would have amounted to an estimated $16 million for Con Edison, including $3 million for CECONY. For certain other such non-derivative transactions, the Companies could be required to post collateral under certain circumstances, including in the event counterparties had reasonable grounds for insecurity.
(b) The Companies measure the collateral requirements by taking into consideration the fair value amounts of derivative instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liabilities position plus amounts owed to counterparties for settled transactions and amounts required by counterparties for minimum financial security. The fair value amounts represent unrealized losses, net of any unrealized gains where the Companies have a legally enforceable right of setoff.
(c) Derivative instruments that are net assets have been excluded from the table. At December31, 2014, if Con Edison had been downgraded to below investment grade, it would have been required to post additional collateral for such derivative instruments of $15 million.
Note P  Fair Value Measurements The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable firm inputs. The Companies often make certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. The Companies use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures established a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The rules require that assets and liabilities be classified in their entirety based on the level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Companies classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined by the accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures as follows:  Level 1  Consists of assets or liabilities whose value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes contracts traded on active exchange markets valued using unadjusted prices quoted directly from the exchange.
Level 2  Consists of assets or liabilities valued using industry standard models and based on prices, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. The industry standard models consider observable assumptions including time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, in addition to other economic measures. This category includes contracts traded on active exchanges or in over-the-counter markets priced with industry standard models.
Level 3  Consists of assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost benefit constraints. This category includes contracts priced using models that are internally developed and contracts placed in illiquid markets. It also includes contracts that expire after the period of time for which quoted prices are available and internal models are used to determine a significant portion of the value.
126 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized below.

There were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013.
(b) Level 2 assets and liabilities include investments held in the deferred compensation plan and/or non-qualified retirement plans, interest rate swap, exchange-traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1, and certain over-the-counter derivative instruments for electricity and natural gas. Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 are valued using industry standard models that incorporate corroborated observable inputs; such as pricing services or prices from similar instruments that trade in liquid markets, time value and volatility factors.
(c) The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures require consideration of the impact of nonperformance risk (including credit risk) from a market participant perspective in the measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities. At December31, 2014 and 2013, the Companies determined that nonperformance risk would have no material impact on their financial position or results of operations.
(d) Other assets are comprised of assets such as life insurance contracts within the deferred compensation plan and non-qualified retirement plans.
(e) Amounts represent the impact of legally-enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Companies to net gain and loss positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.
The employees in the Companies risk management group develop and maintain the Companies valuation policies and procedures for, and verify pricing and fair value valuation of, commodity derivatives. Under the Companies policies and procedures, multiple CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 127 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued independent sources of information are obtained for forward price curves used to value commodity derivatives. Fair value and changes in fair value of commodity derivatives are reported on a monthly basis to the Companies risk committees, comprised of officers and employees of the Companies that oversee energy hedging at the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. The risk management group reports to the Companies Vice President and Treasurer.

The Utilities generally recover these costs in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utilities regulators. See Note A. Unrealized gains and losses for commodity derivatives are generally deferred on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations.
For the competitive energy businesses, realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities are reported in non-utility revenues (immaterial and $2 million loss) and purchased power costs ($27 million gain and $5 million gain) on the consolidated income statement for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in fair value relating to Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities held at December31, 2014 and 2013 is included in non-utility revenues (immaterial and $2 million loss) and purchased power costs ($2 million gain and $3 million gain) on the consolidated income statement for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Note Q  Variable Interest Entities The accounting rules for consolidation address the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have a 128 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and either absorbs a significant amount of the VIEs losses or has the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.
Con Edison enters into arrangements including leases, partnerships and electricity purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, Con Edison retains or may retain a variable interest in these entities.
CECONY CECONY has a variable interest in a non-consolidated VIE, Astoria Energy, LLC (Astoria Energy), with which CECONY has entered into a long-term electricity purchase agreement. CECONY is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE since CECONY does not have the power to direct activities thatCECONY believes most significantly impact the economic performance of Astoria Energy. In particular, CECONY has not invested in, or guaranteed the indebtedness of, Astoria Energy and CECONY does not operate or maintain Astoria Energys generating facilities. CECONY also has long-term electricity purchase agreements with the following three potential VIEs: Cogen Technologies Linden Venture, LP, Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, LP and Indeck Energy Services of Corinth, Inc. In 2014, requests were made of these three counterparties for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether CECONY is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. See Note I for information on these electricity purchase agreements, the payments pursuant to which constitute CECONYs maximum exposure to loss with respect to the potential VIEs.
Con Edison Development Con Edison has a variable interest in Copper Mountain Solar 3 Holdings, LLC (Copper Mountain Solar 3), which is a non-consolidated entity in which Con Edison Development purchased a 50 percent membership interest in 2014. Copper Mountain Solar 3 owns a project company that is developing a 250 MW (AC) solar electric production project in Nevada. Electricity generated by the project is to be sold to the Southern California Public Power Authority pursuant to a long-term power purchase agreement. In addition, Con Edison and Con Edison Development have issued certain guarantees to third parties in connection with Copper Mountain Solar 3. See Guarantees in Note H.
Con Edison has a variable interest in CED California Holdings Financing I, LLC (California Solar), which is no longer a consolidated entity. Con Edison Development sold 50 percent of its membership interest in California Solar which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2014. California Solar owns project companies that operate 110 MW (AC) of solar electric production projects in California. Electricity generated by the projects is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Company pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements. Subsequent to the sale, Con Edison Developments remaining 50 percent interest in California Solar is accounted for under the equity method.
As a result of the sale, Con Edison Development received net proceeds of $108 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $45 million ($26 million, net of tax). The following table summarizes the sale and resultant deconsolidation on the transaction date: (Millions of Dollars) Proceeds from sale, net of transaction costs of $1 $ 108 Non-utility property, less accumulated depreciation (341 ) Other assets, including working capital (31 ) Long-term debt, including current portion 217 Other liabilities 9 Gain on sale of solar electric production projects (45 ) Equity method investment upon deconsolidation $ (83 ) Con Edison has a variable interest in OCI Solar San Antonio 4 LLC (Texas Solar 4), which is a consolidated entity in which Con Edison Development purchased an 80 percent membership interest in 2014 for $49 million. Texas Solar 4 owns a project company that developed a 40 MW (AC) solar electric production project in Texas. Electricity generated by the project is sold to the City of San Antonio pursuant to a long-term power purchase agreement. At December31, 2014, Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet includes $58 million in net assets (as detailed in the table below) and the non-controlling interest of the third party of $9 million related to Texas Solar 4. Earnings for the twelve months ended December31, 2014 were immaterial.

(b) The liabilities of Texas Solar 4 represent liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 129 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Con Edison has a variable interest in Broken Bow II Wind Holdings, LLC (Broken Bow II), which is a non-consolidated entity in which Con Edison Development purchased a 50 percent membership interest in 2014. Broken Bow II owns a project company that developed a 75 MW (AC) wind electric production project in Nebraska.

Con Edison is not the primary beneficiary since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the entities are shared equally between Con Edison Development and third parties. Con Edisons ownership interest in Texas Solar 4 is 80 percent and is consolidated in the financial statements. Con Edison is the primary beneficiary since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of Texas Solar 4 is held by Con Edison Development.
(b) Pilesgrove has 3-5 year Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) hedges in place.
(c) For investments accounted for under the equity method, maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value of the investment on the balance sheet. For consolidated investments, maximum exposure is equal to the net assets of the investment on the balance sheet. Con Edison did not provide any financial or other support during the year that was not previously contractually required.
Note R  Asset Retirement Obligations The Companies recognize a liability at fair value for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred, or when sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value of such legal obligations. When the liability is initially recorded, asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The fair value of the asset retirement obligation liability is measured using expected future cash flows discounted at credit-adjusted risk-free rates, historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors. The Companies evaluate these assumptions underlying the asset retirement obligation liability on an annual basis or as frequently as needed.
The Companies recorded asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in their buildings (other than the structures enclosing generating stations and substations), electric equipment and steam and gas distribution systems. The Companies also recorded asset retirement obligations relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place.
The Companies did not record an asset retirement obligation for the removal of asbestos associated with the structures enclosing generating stations and substations. For these building structures, the Companies were unable to reasonably estimate their asset retirement obligations because the Companies were unable to estimate the undiscounted retirement costs or the retirement dates and settlement dates. The amount of the undiscounted retirement costs could vary considerably depending on the disposition method for the building structures, and the method has not been determined. The Companies anticipate continuing to use these building structures in their businesses for an indefinite period, and so the retirement dates and settlement dates are not determinable.
Con Edison recorded asset retirement obligations for the removal of its competitive energy businesses solar and wind equipment related to projects located on property that is not owned by them and the term of the arrangement is finite including any renewal options. Con Edison did not record asset retirement obligations for its competitive energy businesses projects that are located on property that is owned by them because they expect that the equipment will continue to generate electricity at these facilities long past the manufacturers warranty at minimal operating expense. Therefore Con Edison was unable to reasonably estimate the retirement date of this equipment. The Utilities include in depreciation rates the estimated removal costs, less salvage, for utility plant assets. The amounts related to removal costs that are associated with asset retirement obligations are 130 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued classified as an asset retirement liability. Pursuant to accounting rules for regulated operations, future removal costs that do not represent legal asset retirement obligations are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Accretion and depreciation expenses related to removal costs that represent legal asset retirement obligations are applied against the Companies regulatory liabilities. Asset retirement costs that are recoverable from customers are recorded as regulatory liabilities to reflect the timing difference between costs recovered through the rate-making process and recognition of costs.
At December31, 2014, the liabilities for asset retirement obligations of Con Edison and CECONY were $188million and $185million, respectively, as compared to $143million for both Con Edison and CECONY at December31, 2013. The increase in liabilities at December31, 2014 was due to changes in estimated cash flows of $60million and $57million for Con Edison and CECONY, respectively, and accretion expense of $6million for both Con Edison and CECONY. The increases were offset in part by liabilities settled of $21million for both Con Edison and CECONY. Con Edison and CECONY also recorded reductions of $16million and $17million during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to the regulatory liability associated with cost of removal to reflect depreciation and interest expense.
Note S  Related Party Transactions The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive businesses provide administrative and other services to each other pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the NYSPSC. The costs of administrative and other services provided by CECONY to, and received by it from, Con Edison and its other subsidiaries for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2014 2013 2012 Cost of services provided $ 90 $ 84 $ 83 Cost of services received $ 57 $ 52 $ 49 In addition, CECONY and O&R have joint gas supply arrangements, in connection with which CECONY sold to O&R $80 million, $72 million and $54 million of natural gas for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts are net of the effect of related hedging transactions.
FERC has authorized CECONY through 2015 to lend funds to O&R from time to time, for periods of not more than 12 months, in amounts not to exceed $250 million outstanding at any time, at prevailing market rates. There were no outstanding loans to O&R at December31, 2014 and 2013.
Note T  New Financial Accounting Standards In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments on reporting discontinued operations through Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. The amendments revise the definition of a discontinued operation as a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity, or a business or nonprofit activity that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. The amendments also require additional disclosures for discontinued operations and individually significant disposals that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements. For public entities, the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning on or after December15, 2014. The application of this guidance does not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued a revenue recognition standard that will supersede the revenue recognition requirements within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance under the Codification through ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The purpose of the new guidance is to create a consistent framework for revenue recognition. The guidance clarifies how to measure and recognize revenue arising from customer contracts to depict the transfer of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive. The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. For public entities reporting under GAAP, the new guidance is effective for periods beginning after December15, 2016. The Companies are in the process of evaluating the application and impact of the new guidance on the Companies financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-12, CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments clarify the accounting treatment regarding performance targets. Under the new guidance, a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is required to be treated as a performance condition and should CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2014 131 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized only when it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The amendments are effective for periods beginning after December15, 2015. The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In August 2014, the FASB issued amendments on reporting about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern in ASU No.2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic 205 - 40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments provide guidance about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt surrounding an entitys ability to continue as a going concern. If management concludes that substantial doubt exists, the amendments also require additional disclosures relating to managements evaluation and conclusion. The amendments are effective for the annual reporting period ending after December15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
In November 2014, the FASB issued amendments on pushdown accounting for subsidiaries and acquired entities in ASU No.2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting. The amendments provide guidance as to whether and at what threshold an acquired entity can apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements. The amendments are effective as of the date of issuance. The application of this guidance does not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

Item9A: Controls and Procedures The Companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For each of the Companies, its management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, has concluded that the controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance. Reasonable assurance is not absolute assurance, however, and there can be no assurance that any design of controls or procedures would be effective under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
