Employees Con Edison has no employees other than those of Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive businesses (which at December31, 2005 had 13,191, 1,026 and 320 employees, respectively).
Con Edison of New York Corporate Overview Con Edison of New York, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Con Edison of New York provides electric service in all of New York City (except part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million. It also provides gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens and Westchester, and steam service in parts of Manhattan.
Operating Segments Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses. In 2005, electric, gas and steam operating revenues were 75 percent, 18 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of its operating revenues. For a discussion of the companys operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see Results of Operations in Item7. For additional information about the segments, see Note O to the financial statements in Item8.
Electric Operations Electric Sales.
Electric operating revenues were $7 billion in 2005 or 75 percent of Con Edison of New Yorks operating revenues. The percentages were 77 and 78 percent, respectively, in the two preceding years. In 2005, 51 percent of the electricity delivered by Con Edison of New York in its service area was sold by the company to its full-service customers, 29 percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions, a competitive energy business of Con Edison, to Con Edison of New Yorks customers under its electric retail access program and the balance was delivered to the state and municipal customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and the economic development customers of municipal electric agencies. The company charges its cost for the electricity it sells to full-service customers, and it charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity.
For additional information about electricity sales, see Con Edison of New York Operating Statistics, below, and Results of Operations in Item7.
Electric Peak Demand.
The electric peak demand in Con Edison of New Yorks service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The 2005 service area peak demand, which occurred on July27, 2005, was 13,059thousand kilowatts (MW). The 2005 peak demand included an estimated 7,067 MW for Con Edison of New Yorks full-service customers, 3,858 MW for customers participating in its electric retail access program and 2,134 MW for NYPAs customers and municipal electric agency customers. On July27, 2005, the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) invoked demand reduction programs. Without these reduction programs, the actual 2005 peak 8 Table of Contents demand would have been higher. Design weather for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the majority of demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs potential impact. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2006 service area peak demand will be 13,400 MW, including an estimated 6,875 MW for its full-service customers, 4,355 MW for its electric retail access customers and 2,170 MW for NYPAs customers and municipal electric agency customers.
Electric Supply.
Most of the electricity sold by Con Edison of New York to its customers in 2005 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The firm power contracts were primarily with non-utility generators (NUGs).
The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers with electric energy purchased under contracts with NUGs or others, purchased through the NYISOs wholesale electricity or generated from its electric generating facilities.
For additional information about electric power purchases, see Regulatory Matters and Electric Power Requirements in Item7 and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
For information about the companys contracts with NUGs for approximately 2,060 MW of electric generating capacity, see Note J to the financial statements in Item8.
For information about the companys 692 MW of electric generating facilities, see Item2.
The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of Con Edison of New York, as an integrated system and administers a wholesale market for electricity in New York State. Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the New York State Reliability Council, the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (either owned or contracted for) in an amount that is at least 18 percent above the expected peak demand for their customers. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough New York City-located capacity to cover a substantial percentage of their New York City customer peak demands. Con Edison of New York met the requirements applicable to it in 2005 and expects to meet them in 2006.
The NYISO initiated a Comprehensive Reliability Planning Process in 2005. Its first 10-year assessment indicates potential reliability needs over the period. Such needs will be annually evaluated by the NYISO. The NYISOs planning process currently requires that such reliability needs must be addressed by transmission owners should they not be met by other mechanisms. In the event that the Utilities are required to address the identified reliability needs, associated project costs are eligible for recovery through the NYISO tariff.
Gas Operations Gas Sales.
Gas operating revenues in 2005 were $1.6 billion or 18 percent of Con Edison of New Yorks operating revenues. The percentages were 16 percent in the two preceding years. In 2005, 48 percent of the gas delivered by the company in its service area was sold by the company to its full-service (firm and interruptible) customers and 52 percent was sold by other suppliers. For additional information about gas sales, see Con Edison of New York Operating Statistics, below, and Results of Operations in Item7.
Gas Requirements and Peak Demand.
Firm demand for gas in Con Edison of New Yorks service area peaks during the winter heating season. The design criteria for the companys gas system assume severe weather conditions, which have not occurred since the 1933-34 winter. Under these criteria, the company estimated that its requirements to deliver gas to firm customers during the November 2005/March 2006 winter heating season would amount to 86,600 mdths (including 73,900 mdths to its firm sales customers and 12,700 mdths to its firm transportation customers). Through January31, 2006, the companys peak throughput day in this heating season occurred on January16, 2006, when it delivered 988 mdths of gas (including 600 mdths to its firm and interruptible sales customers, 39 mdths to NYPA, 229 mdths to its transportation customers and 120 mdths for use by the company in generating electricity and steam).
Under its design criteria, the company projects that for the November 2006/March 2007 winter heating season, its requirements for firm gas customers will amount to 87,900 mdths (including 74,300 mdths to firm sales customers and 13,600 mdths to firm transportation customers) and that the peak day requirements for these customers will amount to 1,031 mdths. The company expects to be able to meet these requirements.
Gas Supply.
Con Edison of New York and O&R have established a combined gas supply and capacity portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, Con Edison of New York (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the PSC. See Note S to the financial statements in Item8.
9 Table of Contents Charges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2010. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation and storage services. Charges under these contracts are approved by the FERC. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2013. The Utilities are required to pay certain charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $164 million in 2005. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations in Item7. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and have interruptible gas transportation contracts. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
Steam Operations Steam Sales.
Con Edison of New York sells steam in Manhattan south of 96 th Street, mostly to large office buildings, apartment houses and hospitals. In 2005, steam operating revenues were $649 million or 7 percent of the company's operating revenues. The percentages were 7 percent and 6 percent, respectively, in the two preceding years.
For additional information about Con Edison of New Yorks steam operations, see Regulatory Matters and Results of Operations in Item7, the discussion of Con Edison of New Yorks steam facilities in Item2 and Con Edison of New York Operating Statistics, below.
Steam Peak Demand and Capacity.
Demand for steam in Con Edison of New Yorks service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of 2005/2006 (through January31, 2006) occurred on December14, 2005 when the demand reached 8.4million pounds (mmlbs) per hour. The companys estimate for the winter of 2006/2007 peak demand of its steam customers is 10.6 mmlbs per hour under design criteria, which assume severe weather.
On December31, 2005, the steam system had the capability of delivering about 12.5 mmlbs of steam per hour and Con Edison of New York estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver this capacity in the 2006/2007 winter.
Steam Supply.
Fifty-one percent of the steam sold by Con Edison of New York in 2005 was produced in the companys steam-only generating stations; 36 percent was produced in the companys steam/electric generating stations, where it is first used to generate electricity; and 13 percent was purchased from others. See Item2 for a discussion of Con Edison of New Yorks steam facilities.
Regulation The PSC regulates, among other things, Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rates, the siting of its transmission lines and the issuance of its securities. Certain activities of the company are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. In addition, various matters relating to the construction and operations of the companys facilities are subject to regulation by other governmental agencies. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company. For additional information, including information about the companys electric, gas and steam rates, see Regulatory Matters in Item7.
The PSC from time to time conducts generic proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include those relating to utilities exiting the business of selling electric energy and gas at retail (including an examination of utilities provider of last resort responsibility and consumer protections) and addressing any rate disincentives to the promotion of energy efficiency and distributed generation. The company typically is an active participant in such proceedings. The company does not expect that the pending proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
Competition Con Edison of New York is primarily a "wires and pipes" energy delivery company that:  has sold most of its electric generating capacity;  provides its customers the opportunity to buy electricity and gas from other suppliers;  purchases substantially all of the electricity and all of the gas it sells to its full-service customers (the cost of which is recovered pursuant to provisions approved by the PSC); and  provides energy delivery services to customers pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC.
See Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Note B and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in Note A to the financial statements in Item8.
Competition from suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for Con Edison of New York delivery customers. The company does not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain PSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements and install facilities to provide the service. A new company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the PSC.
10 Table of Contents Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edison of New York's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources  Capital Resources and Capital Requirements and Financial and Commodity Market Risks in Item7.
Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenals (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of Con Edison of New York and its predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored. See Asbestos and "Superfund in the discussion of Con Edison of New York's legal proceedings in Item3 and Note G to the financial statements in Item8.
Con Edison of New York's capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $90 million in 2005 and are estimated to be $84 million in 2006.
In April 2000, Con Edison of New York entered into a Stipulation and Order of Consent with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in connection with its response to the release of PCBs during the September 1998 transformer fire at the Arthur Kill Generating Station site that it sold in 1999. Among other things, the company agreed to maintain an effective environmental compliance program.
Toxic Substances Control Act.
Virtually all electric utilities, including Con Edison of New York, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.
Water Quality.
Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of Con Edison of New Yorks service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
The potential for adverse effects from global warming associated with the atmospheric release of greenhouse gases (GHG), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), from industrial sources may result in legislation or regulations requiring utilities to reduce GHG emissions from power plants and take other steps to offset GHG emissions from other sources. Con Edison of New York minimizes GHG emissions from its generating plants through the use of oil and gas fuels and the application of cogeneration technologies that reduce GHG emissions per unit of energy output. The company's GHG emissions also include sulfur hexafluoride (used for arc suppression at substations) and methane (from operation of its gas delivery system), which the company is working voluntarily with EPA to reduce.

Superfund The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites at which Con Edison of New York has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies former manufactured gas sites, its Astoria PCB storage facility, the Arthur Kill Generating Station site and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the company has 17 Table of Contents liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the company under Superfund, including with respect to its manufactured gas sites, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
Con Edison of New York and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for manufactured gas at sites in New York City and Westchester County (MGP Sites). Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than Con Edison of New York and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is requiring the company to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, which include 33 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites.
The information available to Con Edison of New York for most of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods, if any, to be used. Through the end of 2005, investigations of all or portions of 30 of the MGP Sites have been started and have been completed at ten of the sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 24 MGP Sites, including sites in Manhattan and other parts of New York City and in Westchester County.
Astoria Site.
Con Edison of New York is permitted by the DEC to operate a PCB storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Apart from the PCB storage facility, portions of the property were the former location of a manufactured gas plant and have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its DEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The company has investigated various sections of the property and is planning additional investigations. The company has submitted to the DEC and the New York State Department of Health a report identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of the known contamination on the property will be at least $21 million.
Arthur Kill Site.
Following a September 1998 transformer fire at Con Edison of New York's former Arthur Kill Generating Station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of PCBs was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed DEC-approved cleanup programs for the station's facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July 1999 DEC consent order, the company completed a DEC-approved assessment of the nature and extent of the contamination in, and recommended a remediation program, for the waterfront area of the station. DEC has selected the remediation program for the waterfront area and the company will implement it pursuant to an additional consent order entered into during 2005. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of PCB contamination at the site will be approximately $3.4 million. See Con Edison of New York  Environmental Matters in Item 1.
Flushing Service Center Site.
The owner of a former Con Edison of New York service center facility in Flushing, New York, has informed the company that PCB contamination has been detected on a substantial portion of the property, which the owner plans to investigate, remediate, and redevelop for residential and commercial use pursuant to the New York Brownfield Cleanup Program administered by the DEC. In late 2005, the property owner claimed that the costs of investigation and remediation will be approximately $34 million and has demanded that the company pay these costs.
Other Superfund Sites.
Con Edison of New York is a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.
18 Table of Contents The following table lists each of Con Edison of New Yorks other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in table under Start), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending, and the companys current estimate of its approximate potential liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring and environmental damages at the site or the unpaid share of any payments it is required to make under a settlement agreement resolving its liability for the site.

O&R Asbestos For information about legal proceedings relating to exposure to asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Superfund The sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Four of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, three of which have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The DEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites.
O&R has completed remedial investigations at five of its seven MGP Sites and will complete investigation of the remaining two sites in 2006. O&R has completed the remediation at one of its sites and has received DECs decision regarding the remedial work to be done at another site. Since the latter site is Company- owned and has no off-site impacts, remediation of this site has been deferred, with DECs concurrence, until approximately 2010. O&R is currently implementing remediation at its Nyack MGP site.
West Nyack Site.
In 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with the DEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking underground storage tank was found as well. O&R has completed all remediation at the site that the DEC has required to date. The DEC has requested an additional groundwater investigation and an on-site vapor intrusion study.
Other Superfund Sites.
O&R is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites has been, and is expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.
19 Table of Contents The following table lists each of O&Rs other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities with respect to the site (shown in table under Start), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and the companys current estimate of its potential liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring and environmental damages at the site.

(Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about Con Edison of New York applies to Con Edison.
Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.
Corporate Overview Con Edisons principal business operations are those of its utility companies, Con Edison of New York and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), together known as the Utilities. Con Edison also has competitive businesses that compete primarily in energy-related businesses (see Competitive Energy Businesses, below).

Con Edisons net income for common stock in 2005 was $719 million or $2.95 a share. Net income for common stock in 2004 and 2003 was $537 million or $2.28 a share and $528 million or $2.39 a share, respectively. The 2005 results reflect increased energy sales and deliveries, the electric rate plan that took effect in April 2005 and the gas and steam rate plans that took effect in October 2004. See Results of Operations  Summary, below.
Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. For segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements and Results of Operations, below.
For information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Companies, see Risk Factors, below.
Regulated Utilities Con Edison of New York provides electric service to approximately 3.2million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1million customers in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility businesses, provides electric service to approximately 0.3million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 0.1million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania.
The Utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The Utilities customers buy this energy from the Utilities, or from other suppliers through the Utilities retail access programs. The Utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets, and recover (generally on a current basis) the cost of the energy sold, pursuant to approved rate plans.
Con Edison anticipates that the Utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years. The Utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the Utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service, including a return on invested equity capital. The factors affecting demand for utility service include weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions.
Because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability, the Utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part actual growth in electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions, as well as forecast growth in peak usage.
25 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED The Utilities had estimated prior to the summer of 2005 that, under design weather conditions, the 2005 peak electric demand in their respective service areas would be 13,025 MW for Con Edison of New York and 1,500 MW for O&R. On July27, 2005, the electric demands served by the Utilities reached new record peaks, 13,059 MW for Con Edison of New York, and 1,539 MW for O&R. The higher-than-forecasted demands were primarily due to increased customer demand and actual temperatures that were slightly higher than those used in developing the forecast. Also, on July27, 2005, the NYISO invoked demand reduction programs. Without these reduction programs, the experienced peak demands would have been higher.
The average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percent for Con Edison of New York and 2.7 percent for O&R. Since demand reduction programs are invoked only in specific circumstances, design conditions do not include their potential impact. The Companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that the Utilities currently provide (see Liquidity and Capital Resources  Capital Requirements, below).
The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers. Con Edison of New Yorks electric, gas and steam rate plans are effective through March31, 2008,September30, 2007 and September30, 2006, respectively. The company has filed a request for a new steam rate plan to be effective October1, 2006. O&R has rate plans for its electric and gas services in New York that extend through October31, 2006. O&R has filed a request for a new gas rate plan to be effective November1, 2006. Pursuant to the Utilities rate plans, charges to customers may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply, for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally require the Utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on equity. Changes in delivery volumes are reflected in operating income (except to the extent that weather-normalization provisions apply to the gas businesses and subject to provisions in the rate plans for sharing above-target earnings with customers). See Regulatory Matters below and Recoverable Energy Costs and Rate and Restructuring Agreements in Notes A and B, respectively, to the financial statements.
Accounting rules and regulations for public utilities include Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," pursuant to which the economic effects of rate regulation are reflected in financial statements. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below.
Competitive Energy Businesses Con Edisons competitive energy businesses participate in competitive businesses and are subject to different risks than the Utilities. In view of conditions affecting certain of its competitive activities, the company recognized an impairment charge of $18 million ($10 million after tax) for certain generating assets in 2003. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below. At December31, 2005, Con Edisons investment in its competitive energy businesses was $543 million and their assets amounted to $1.6 billion.
Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions) sells electricity to delivery customers of the Utilities and other utilities primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and also offers energy related services. The company sold approximately 10million megawatt hours of electricity to customers in 2005.
Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development) owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects. At December31, 2005, the company owned the equivalent of 1,668 MW of capacity in electric generating facilities of which 203 MW is sold under long-term purchase power agreements and the balance is sold on the wholesale electricity markets.
Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy) provides energy and capacity to Con Edison Solutions and others and markets the output of plants owned or operated by Con Edison Development. The company also provides risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development and offers these services to others.
Over the next two years the competitive energy businesses will focus on increasing their customer base, gross margins and the value of their existing assets. See Liquidity and Capital Resources  Capital Requirements and Capital Resources, below.
Discontinued Operations In December 2005, Con Edison signed an agreement to sell Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications) to RCN Corporation. See Note U to the financial statements.
Results of Operations  Summary Con Edisons earnings per share in 2005 were $2.95 ($2.94 on a diluted basis). In 2004, earnings per share were $2.28 ($2.27 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2003 were $2.39 ($2.38 on a diluted basis).

Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. These risk factors include: The Utilities Revenues And Results Of Operations Reflect Regulatory Actions The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers. The prices generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions. The rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards. Certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. Regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans. The regulators in the states in which the Utilities provide service generally permit the Utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service, other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred. The Utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations. See Application of Critical Accounting Polices and Regulatory Matters, below.
27 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Con Edisons Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Is Subject To Regulatory Restrictions Con Edisons ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are generally limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See Dividends in Note C to the financial statements.
The Companies Purchase Energy For Their Customers A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the Companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the Companies results of operations. The Companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply, including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterpartys non-performance. The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including the cost of hedging transactions, in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity-related price and volumetric risks. See Financial and Commodity Market RisksCommodity Price Risk, below.
Energy Market Prices Have Increased Significantly The impact of higher energy market prices on the Companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the Utilities recover energy supply costs. However, higher energy market prices are resulting in significant increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage. If this were to occur, the Companies would have decreased energy delivery revenues. The higher prices of electricity, fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of Con Edisons competitive energy businesses generating facilities.
The Utilities Have A Substantial Ongoing Utility Construction Program The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $5.3 billion over the next three years. The ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission and distribution system projects. The failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the Utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide. The Utilities expect to use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowing to fund the construction expenditures. Changes in capital market conditions or in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds. The Companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys), Standard& Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The current ratings are shown in Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources, below.
The Companies Operate Essential Energy Facilities And Other Systems The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in, or close to, public places. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. The Companies have information systems relating to their operations, billing, accounting and other matters, the failure of which could adversely affect the Companies operations and liquidity. In the event of failure or damage to these facilities or systems, the Utilities could incur substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The Utilities have training, operating, security, maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities and information systems.
Con Edisons Competitive Energy Businesses Are In Evolving Markets Con Edisons competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies, other organizations (such as independent system operators) and other competitive businesses. Compared to the Utilities, the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of Con Edisons investment in these competitive businesses is not as predictable.
The Companies May Be Affected By The Application Of Critical Accounting Policies And Rules The application of the Companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. These policies, which are described in Application of Critical Accounting Policies, below, include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities, the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and accounting for contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. New accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies, rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the Companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities.
Con Edison Is Engaged In A Material Legal Proceeding With Northeast Utilities In 2001, Con Edison sued Northeast Utilities to recover damages from its breach of the merger agreement with them and to seek the courts declaration that Con Edison had no further obligations under the merger agreement. Northeast Utilities alleges Con Edison breached the merger 28 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED agreement and has been pursuing a counter-claim against Con Edison for damages in excess of $1.2 billion. There are also claims by purported classes of Northeast Utilities shareholders seeking damages from Con Edison that the company believes to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities. See Note H to the financial statements.
The Companies Are Exposed To Risks Relating To Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See Environmental Matters, below and Note G to the financial statements. Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are found wherever electricity is used. If a causal relationship between EMF and adverse health effects were established, there could be a material adverse effect on the Companies. Negative perceptions about EMF can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies operations.
The Companies Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And Taxation The Companies operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. The Companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service, which has completed its audits of the tax returns through 1996, does not or may not agree. See Notes K and M to the financial statements. The Companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies.
The Companies Face Weather And Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather, which directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam and can affect the price of energy commodities. The cost of repairing damage to the Companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events could be substantial. The occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the New York or United States economy. A lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect the Companies revenues and earnings and limit the Companies future growth prospects.
Forward-Looking Statements This report includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe-harbor provisions of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts. Words such as expects, estimates, anticipates, intends, believes, plans, will and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements because of various factors such as those discussed under Risk Factors, above.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases.
Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities  SFAS No.71 The Utilities are subject to SFAS No.71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No.71.
The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
29 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery (as required by SFAS No.71), these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December31, 2005, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edisons competitive businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes E and F to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Primarily because of the amortization of previous years net investment gains, Con Edison of New Yorks pension expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period (20 percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20 percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No.87.
The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets and assumptions for future periods. Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks current estimates for 2006 are increases, compared with 2005, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $74 million and $67 million, respectively. The increases reflect the amortization of prior period actuarial losses associated with declines in the market value of assets in recent years, a change in the discount rate assumption from 5.9 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2006 and a decrease in the expected return on plan assets from 8.8 percent in 2005 to 8.5 percent in 2006. Generally, to the extent pension and other postretirement benefit costs vary from the amounts reflected in rates for such costs, the difference will be deferred in accordance with current rate agreements. See Note B to the financial statements.
Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to increase Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional $12 million in 2007. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2006, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.5 percent would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by approximately $15 million in 2007.
The discount rate is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moodys) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. Due to declines in bond yields and interest rates, the company reduced the discount rate used to calculate 2005 pension and other postretirement benefit costs to 5.9% compared to 6.3% and 6.75% in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In determining the health care cost trend rate, the company reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.
30 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED The following table illustrates the effect on 2005 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 28 $ 3 $ 31 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 26 $ 2 $ 28 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 18 $ 2 $ 20 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 18 $ 2 $ 20 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % N/A $ 3 $ 3 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % N/A $ 1 $ 1 Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 268 $ 39 $ 307 Con Edison of New York (0.25 %) $ 250 $ 34 $ 284 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % N/A $ 36 $ 36 Con Edison of New York 1.00 % N/A $ 17 $ 17 Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which Con Edison of New York, O&R and the competitive businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. An actuarial valuation of Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks plan funded status as of December31, 2005, showed that the fair value of the plans assets exceeded the plans accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) by $214 million and $418, respectively, at that date. However, the fair market value of the plan assets could fall below the plans ABO in future years. In that event, each of the Companies would be required, under SFAS No.87, to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between its share of the fair value of the plan assets and its portion of the ABO, plus, in the case of Con Edison of New York, its total prepaid pension costs, through a non-cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect net income for common stock.
The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to their pension plans in 2005 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive businesses made discretionary contributions of $2 million, $31 million and $1 million, respectively, to the plan in 2005. In 2006, Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edisons competitive businesses expect to make discretionary contributions of $34 million, $35 million and $1 million, respectively.
The Companies policy is to fund their pension and postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible.
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.5, Accounting for Contingencies, applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes K and M); legal proceedings relating to Con Edisons 1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities (Note H); and other contingencies (Note I). In accordance with SFAS No.5, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
The Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.
Accounting for Long-Lived Assets SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets requires that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under SFAS No.144 an 31 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.
Con Edisons competitive businesses test their assets for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. A critical element of this test is the forecast of future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the long-lived assets. Forecast of these cash flows requires complex judgments about future operations, which are particularly difficult to make with respect to evolving industries such as the energy-related and telecommunications businesses. Under SFAS No.144, if alternative courses of action are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows, the probability of all possible outcomes must be weighted. With respect to the forecasted cash flows associated with Con Edison Developments generation facilities, a 10 percent decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these facilities would not result in an impairment charge. As a result of the tests performed in 2003, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $159 million ($94 million after tax) for the assets of its competitive telecommunications and generation businesses. No impairments were identified by the 2004 tests. As a result of the 2005 tests, Con Edison recognized impairment charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax) with respect to its telecommunications assets. In order to establish the fair value of the assets, the agreement to sell Con Edison Communications to RCN for $32 million was used. See Note U to the financial statements.
Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment. See Note L to the financial statements. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill.
The goodwill of $406 million at December31, 2005, was most recently tested for impairment during the first quarter of 2005. This test did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The companys most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10 percent would not have resulted in the carrying value of any reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note P to the financial statements.
Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to SFAS No.133, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
Accounting for Leases The Companies apply SFAS No.13, Accounting for Leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note K to the financial statements for information about Con Edison Developments Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the Internal Revenue Service and a possible future charge to earnings. In accordance with SFAS No.13, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below.
32 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED The principal factors affecting Con Edisons liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities. In addition, in 2004 and 2003, Con Edison issued 16.7million and 11.9million shares of common stock for $578 and $436 million, respectively, of which $512 million and $378 million were invested in Con Edison of New York. Con Edison also issued $200 million of five-year debt in 2003, most of the proceeds of which were invested in its competitive businesses.
The principal factors affecting Con Edison of New Yorks liquidity are its cash flows from operations, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures) and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
Con Edison of New Yorks expenditures have included approximately $513 million related to the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent restoration of lower Manhattan energy services and facilities; to date the company has received reimbursement of $76 million of such costs from insurance carriers and $93 million from the federal government and is pursuing further reimbursement of such costs. See Note I to the financial statements.
The Companies current liabilities exceeded their current assets at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowing to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.
Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See Risk Factors, and Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Regulatory Matters, below.
Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 Variance 2005 vs. 2004 2003 Variance 2004 vs. 2003 Operating activities $ 793 $ 1,311 $ (518 ) $ 1,309 $ 2 Investing activities (1,277 ) (1,531 ) 254 (1,534 ) 3 Financing activities 539 197 342 156 41 Net change for the period 55 (23 ) 78 (69 ) 46 Balance at beginning of period 26 49 (23 ) 118 (69 ) Balance at end of period $ 81 $ 26 $ 55 $ 49 $ (23 ) Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 Variance 2005 vs. 2004 2003 Variance 2004 vs. 2003 Operating activities $ 818 $ 1,201 $ (383 ) $ 1,169 $ 32 Investing activities (1,167 ) (1,412 ) 245 (1,337 ) (75 ) Financing activities 400 188 212 113 75 Net change for the period 51 (23 ) 74 (55 ) 32 Balance at beginning of period 10 33 (23 ) 88 (55 ) Balance at end of period $ 61 $ 10 $ 51 $ 33 $ (23 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as weather and economic conditions. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements.
Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges include depreciation, Con Edisons impairment charges in 2005 and 2003, and in 2004 charges in accordance with Con Edison of New Yorks rate plans. For Con Edison of New York, principal non-cash credits included prepaid pension costs and in 2005, amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities, including the tax 33 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED effects, in accordance with its current electric rate plan. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits and Notes E and F to the financial statements.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2005 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $518 million and $383 million lower, respectively, than in 2004. The decrease reflects primarily prepayment of New York City property taxes and an increase in customer accounts receivable, offset in part by increases in accounts payable. The increase in prepayments reflects a New York City program under which Con Edison of New York achieved a 1.5 percent reduction in its City property taxes for the fiscal year ending June30, 2006 by prepaying the taxes on June30, 2005 instead of paying them in semi-annual installments on their due dates (July 1, 2005 and January1, 2006). The increases in customer accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect primarily higher energy market prices and higher sales and delivery volumes. See Changes in Assets and Liabilities, below.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2004 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $2 million lower and $32 million higher than 2003, respectively. The change at Con Edison of New York reflects lower accounts receivable balances at December31, 2004 as compared with year-end 2003 partially offset by an increase in materials and supplies.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $254 million and $245 million lower, respectively, in 2005 than in the 2004, reflecting primarily $534 million of net proceeds from the completion in May 2005 of the sale of Con Edison of New York properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan, collectively referred to as the First Avenue Properties (see Other Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements), partially offset by increased utility construction expenditures.
Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $3 million lower in 2004 than in 2003, due primarily to lower construction expenditures by its competitive businesses, partially offset by increased construction expenditures by the Utilities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $75 million higher in 2004 than in 2003 for Con Edison of New York due primarily to increased construction expenditures.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased $342 million and $212 million in 2005 compared with 2004, and increased $41 million and $75 million, respectively, in 2004 compared with 2003.
Con Edisons cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 14million and 9.6million Con Edison common shares resulting in proceeds of $512 million and $378 million, respectively, which were invested by Con Edison in Con Edison of New York. Cash flows from financing activities in 2003 also reflect the issuance of $200 million of Con Edisons 3.625 percent 5-year debentures, most of which was invested in the competitive businesses. Cash flows from financing activities for 2005, 2004 and 2003 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans (2005: 2.8million shares for $78 million, 2004: 2.7million shares for $66 million; 2003: 2.3million shares for $58 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $38 million in 2005, $39 million in 2004 and $40 million in 2003.
Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ending December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 also reflect the following Con Edison of New York transactions: 2005  Issued $350 million 5.3% 30-year debentures, $125 million 5.25% 30-year debentures and $350 million 5.375% 10-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes;  Redeemed at maturity $100 million 6.625% 10-year debentures and $350 million 6.625% 5-year debentures; and  Issued note for $126 million of variable-rate, tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2039, the proceeds of which were used together with other funds to redeem in advance of maturity $128 million 6.10% fixed-rate tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds due 2020.
2004  Issued notes for $344 million of variable-rate, tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, with various maturity dates between 28 and 35 years, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity fixed-rate tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, 5.25% due 2020, 5.375% due 2022, 6.0% due 2028 and 7.125% due 2029;  Issued $200 million 4.7% 10-year debentures and $200 million 5.7% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $150 million 7.125% debentures due 2029 and for general corporate purposes;  Redeemed at maturity $150 million 7.625% 12-year debentures; and 34 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED  Issued $275 million 4.7% 5-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used in July to redeem in advance of maturity $275 million 7.35% 40-year debentures.
2003  Redeemed in advance of maturity $275 million 7.75% 35-year Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2031 using cash held for that purpose at December31, 2002;  Redeemed at maturity $150 million 6.375% 10-year debentures and issued $175 million 5.875% 30-year debentures; and  Redeemed $380 million 7.5% 30-year debentures due 2023 using the net proceeds from the issuance of $200 million 3.85% 10-year debentures and $200 million 5.10% 30-year debentures.
Con Edisons net cash flows from financing activities also include O&Rs financings. In 2005, O&R issued $40 million 5.3% 10-year debentures. In 2004, $46 million of 5.22% Transition Bonds associated with securitization of previously deferred purchased power costs of O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary were issued. In 2003, O&R redeemed at maturity $35 million of 6.56% 10-year debentures.
Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and the average daily balances for 2005, 2004 and 2003 for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were as follows: (Millions of Dollars, except Weighted AverageYield) 2005 2004 2003 Out- standing at Dec.31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec.31 Daily average Out- standing at Dec.31 Daily average Con Edison $ 755 $ 210 $ 156 $ 166 $ 156 $ 326 Con Edison of New York $ 520 $ 118 $ 100 $ 126 $ 99 $ 179 Weighted average yield 4.3 % 3.3 % 2.2 % 1.2 % 1.0 % 1.2 % External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets.

Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in assets and liabilities at December31, 2005, compared with December31, 2004, that have impacted the Companies consolidated statements of cash flows. The changes in these balances are used to reconcile income to cash flow from operations.

For the Utilities, the mark-to-market gains had no effect on net income as the gains were deferred as regulatory liabilities (deferred derivative gains). In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers their energy supply costs, net of gains and losses on derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases. The mark-to-market accounting for Con Edisons competitive energy businesses forward sales of electricity from their generating plants resulted in an increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities. The competitive energy businesses record mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative instruments in earnings in the reporting period in which such changes occur.
The increase in the Companies prepayments at December31, 2005 as compared with year-end 2004 reflects primarily the prepayment of New York City property taxes as discussed above in Cash Flows from Operating Activities.
Accounts receivable net of allowance for uncollectibles increased at December31, 2005 as compared with year-end 2004 due primarily to the impact of higher energy market prices on full-service customers bills.
The increase in the Companies other receivables reflects Con Edison of New Yorks purchase of accounts receivable from authorized electricity and gas providers in its service territory (also known as energy service companies) pursuant to a program established in accordance with Con Edison of New 35 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Yorks rate plans. The increase also reflects a property tax refund claim relating to the East River Repowering Project.
Accounts payable increased at December31, 2005 as compared with year-end 2004 due primarily to the impact of higher energy market prices.
Other current liabilities increased at December31, 2005 as compared with year-end 2004 due primarily to increases in the collateral of $57 million received by the Companies in energy market transactions. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks  Credit Risk, below. In addition, the increase reflects Con Edison of New Yorks purchase of accounts receivable from authorized electricity and gas providers in its service territory in accordance with its rate plans.
Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper and the issuance in 2006 of between $250 million and $450 million of Con Edison common shares in addition to stock issuances under its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries.
For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements.
For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements.
The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings.
In May 2005, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $4.4 billion of debt securities prior to December31, 2009. In January 2006, the PSC authorized O&R to issue up to $325 million of debt securities prior to December31, 2009. In addition, the PSC has authorized the refunding of the Utilities outstanding debt securities and preferred stock, should the Utilities determine that it is economic to do so.
Con Edisons competitive businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings. See Note Q to the financial statements.
For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was: Earnings to Fixed ChargesRatio 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Con Edison 3.1 2.6 3.1 3.1 3.4 Con Edison of New York 3.7 3.1 3.4 3.4 3.7 For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was: Common Equity Ratio 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison 49.0 51.0 48.0 Con Edison of New York 50.7 52.9 49.3 The commercial paper of the Companies is rated P-1, A-1 and F1, respectively, by Moodys, S&P and Fitch.

Con Edison of New Yorks utility construction expenditures in 2003 and 2004 reflect programs to meet growth in the demand for electricity and reliability needs, gas infrastructure expenditures, the East River Repowering Project and expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the 2001 World Trade Center attack (see Note I to the financial statements). The increases in 2005 reflect a higher level of expenditures for electric substations and ongoing improvements and reinforcements of the electric distribution system.
The competitive energy businesses construction expenditures declined in 2004 and 2005, and are expected to decline in 2006. At December31, 2005 and 2004, Con Edisons investment balance in these businesses, on an unconsolidated basis, was $543 million and $599 million, respectively.

(b) Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.
(c) Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the other purchase obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their purchasing systems to enable them to report their other purchase obligations in a different manner.
(d) Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity and generating plant services entered into by Con Edison's competitive energy businesses. Amounts do not include commitments of Con Edison Communications.

See Notes E, F, Q and Guarantees in Note I to the financial statements.
Electric Power Requirements In 2005, the Utilities purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2006.
In general, the Utilities recover prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks  Commodity Price Risk, below and Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in 2006. See Notes J and P to the financial statements. O&Rs New Jersey subsidiary entered into firm contracts to purchase electric energy for substantially all of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in 2006.
Con Edison of New York also owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December31, 2005, the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 692 MW. In April 2005, the companys East River Repowering Project was placed in service, adding 292 MW (on a summer nominal rating) of in-City electric capacity. Also in 2005, the company retired its Waterside generating station, reducing its electric capacity by 167 MW. The company sells the electric output of its generating stations through the NYISOs wholesale electricity market. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity.
In a July 1998 order, the PSC indicated that it agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops, but considers overly broad and did not adopt Con Edison of New Yorks request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO.
For information about transmission issues arising from the proposed closure of the Lovett generating station located in O&Rs service territory see Generating Assets Sold to Mirant in Note I to the financial statements.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses sell electricity to wholesale and retail customers in the NYISO and other markets. In addition, at December31, 2005, Con Edison Development owns equity interests in electric generating facilities equivalent to 1,668 MW of net generating capacity, substantially all of which is located within the PJM Interconnection or the New England Power Pool. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities on the wholesale electricity markets or under contract.

Also see Note B to the financial statements for a description of the pending Con Edison of New York steam rate filing and the pending O&R gas rate filing.
The Companies are actively participating in regulatory proceedings at the federal level that are underway to implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Act provides for the establishment of an Electric Reliability Organization to implement mandatory reliability standards, implementation of transmission pricing incentives, numerous studies regarding economic dispatch and transmission system needs, changes to market manipulation standards for electricity and natural gas and other changes that could impact the Companies businesses in the future.
Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate-debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Companies estimate that each 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to Con Edisons and Con Edison of New Yorks variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of $5 million and $4 million, respectively.
In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note P to the financial statements.
40 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED Commodity Price Risk Con Edisons commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements.
Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2005, each 10 percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $161 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $130 million is for Con Edison of New York and $31 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December31, 2005, and 2004, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-DayHoldingPeriod 2005 2004 (MillionsofDollars) Average for the period $ 3 $ 1 High 15 3 Low 1 1 Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterpartys nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff.
The Utilities had $272 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2005, of which $175 million was with investment-grade counterparties and $97 million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Con Edisons competitive energy businesses had $158 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2005, of which $133 million was with investment grade counterparties and $11 million was with commodity exchanges or independent system operators. The remaining $14 million was with entities which lacked ratings or whose ratings were not investment grade.
Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December31, 2005, the pension plan investments consisted of 67 percent equity and 33 percent fixed income and other securities. See Note E to the financial statements.
Environmental Matters For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see Note G to the financial statements.
Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of 41 Table of Contents M ANAGEMENT  S D ISCUSSION AND A NALYSIS OF F INANCIAL C ONDITION AND R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS (C OMBINED FOR C ON E DISON AND C ON E DISON OF N EW Y ORK )  C ONTINUED lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Also, to the extent the Companies prices change by more or less than inflation, the real price of the Companies services will increase or decline. Over the past 20 years, for example, the real price of electric service has declined substantially.
Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Accounting for Contingencies and Notes G, H, I, K and M to the financial statements.
Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above), rate plans that cover the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Regulatory Matters, above) and demand for utility service. Demand for utility service is affected by weather, economic conditions and other factors.
The Companies results of operations for the 12 months ended December31, 2005 reflect higher net revenues resulting from the warmer than normal summer weather, growth in energy deliveries and the Con Edison of New York electric rate plan that became effective April1, 2005 and gas and steam rate plans that became effective October1, 2004. The higher net revenues were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, and a reduction in net credits for pensions and other postretirement benefits. In addition, depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2005, reflecting large continuing investments in energy delivery infrastructure. For Con Edison, results of operations also reflect accounting for the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations  Summary, above.
In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations.
A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note O to the financial statements.

After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period and the August 2003 regional power outage, electric delivery volumes in Con Edison of New Yorks service area increased 1.4 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. Weather-adjusted sales represent an estimate of the sales that would have been made if historical average weather conditions had prevailed.
Con Edison of New Yorks electric fuel costs increased $46 million in 2004 as compared with 2003, primarily because the companys generation plants were dispatched more frequently than in the same period last year. Electric purchased power costs decreased $80 million, reflecting a decrease in purchased volumes, partially offset by higher unit costs.
Con Edison of New Yorks electric operating income decreased $106 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The principal components of the decrease were lower net revenues ($147 million), and increases in other operations and maintenance expense ($49 million  due primarily to a reduced net credit for pensions and other postretirement benefits), property taxes ($21 million) and depreciation ($16 million). The increases in expense were offset in part by lower income tax ($80 million), state and local revenue taxes ($32 million), sales and use tax ($8 million).
Gas Con Edison of New Yorks gas operating revenues in 2004 increased $8 million compared with 2003, reflecting primarily higher firm and non-firm revenues due principally to the gas rate plan ($23 million) and the reconciliation of gas distribution losses to levels reflected in rates, which resulted in a net benefit of $12 million. This increase was partially offset by non-cash charge ($18 million) under the gas rate plan (see Note B to the financial statements).

O&Rs gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2004 compared with 2003 were: Thousands of DTHs Twelve Months Ended Percent Variation Description December31, 2004 December31, 2003 Variation Firm Sales Residential 9,487 10,810 (1,323 ) (12.2 )% General 2,487 3,314 (827 ) (25.0 ) Firm Transportation 9,931 8,498 1,433 16.9 Total Firm Sales and Transportation 21,905 22,622 (717 ) (3.2 ) Off Peak/Interruptible Sales 6,996 6,833 163 2.4 Non-Firm Transportation ofGas Generation Plants 659 2,833 (2,174 ) (76.7 ) Other 1,068 1,134 (66 ) (5.8 ) Total Sales and Transportation 30,628 33,422 (2,794 ) (8.4 )% Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.2 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of the milder winter and warm spring weather. After adjusting for weather variations in each period and the August 2003 power outage, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.9 percent higher in 2004 compared with 2003.
Non-firm transportation of customer-owned gas to electric generating plants decreased 76.7 percent in 2004 as compared with 2003 because the relative prices of gas and fuel oil led power plants in the companys gas service area to utilize oil rather than gas for a significant portion of their generation. In addition, one area power plant has changed equipment at its two coal-fired units to significantly reduce the volume of gas required for ignition. The decline in gas usage had minimal impact on earnings due to the application of a fixed demand charge for local transportation.
Gas operating income was the same in 2004 as in 2003. Increased gas operations and maintenance expenses of $12 million, primarily related to pensions and other postretirement benefits, were offset by an increase in net gas revenues of $7 million, reflecting the 2003 gas rate agreement, and by a decrease in federal and state income tax of $4 million and lower taxes other than income taxes of $1 million.

(b) Includes a sales and use tax refund of approximately $800,000.
Income Taxes Operating income taxes decreased by $17 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to the deferral of state income tax benefits for ratepayers in 2004 and lower taxable income in 2004 compared with 2003.
Other Income O&Rs other income (deductions) increased $3 million in 2004 compared with 2003, due primarily to the reclassification to other income (deductions) in 2003 of losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income related to investments in marketable securities.
Competitive Businesses and Other Competitive Energy Businesses The earnings of the competitive energy businesses were $12 million lower in 2004 than in 2003. Excluding the effects of asset impairment charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, earnings were $20 million lower in 2004. The decrease in earnings reflects several factors, including lower gross margins realized on retail electric sales, a full year of operating expenses associated with generation assets placed in service in mid-2003, and depreciation expense on the Newington plant which was consolidated for financial statement purposes in the last quarter of 2003. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher mark-to-market gains on forward transactions.
Operating revenues of the competitive energy businesses were $138 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, reflecting principally sales from Con Edison Developments increased generating capacity and higher retail electric sales at Con Edison Solutions.
Operating expenses excluding income taxes increased by $129 million, reflecting principally increased purchased power and fuel costs ($192 million), depreciation ($17 million) and maintenance expenses ($8 million). This increase was offset in part by lower costs for gas purchased for resale ($32 million), impairment charges recognized at Con Edison Development and Con Edison Solutions in 2003 ($18 million), lower taxes other than income taxes ($6 million) and decreased other operations expense at Con Edison Development ($32 million) due principally to the consolidation accounting associated with the Newington plant. Lease payments were recorded in operations expense in 2003, whereas depreciation and interest expense were charged in 2004 in accordance with consolidation accounting. See Note T to the financial statements.
Operating income taxes decreased $6 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily lower taxable income.
Operating income for 2004 was $15 million higher than in 2003.
Other income (deductions) increased $4 million in 2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to unrealized gains on derivatives in 2004.
Interest charges for 2004 increased by $29 million as compared with 2003 due principally to the additional interest expense attributable to the consolidation of the Newington plant discussed above.
Other Earnings attributable to the parent company were $4 million lower in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily higher interest expenses.
Discontinued Operations Losses from the discontinued operations of Con Edison Communications were $97 million lower in 2004 as compared with 2003 reflecting primarily the impairment charge totaling $84 million (after tax) recorded in 2003.

55 Table of Contents Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of Con Edison is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management of Con Edison assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, using the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on that assessment, management has concluded that Con Edison had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Con Edisons independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Kevin Burke President and Chief Executive Officer Robert N. Hoglund Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February16, 2006 56 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Consolidated Edison, Inc.: We have completed integrated audits of Consolidated Edison, Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, which are presented separately in the Con Edison of New York consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Con Edisons other utility subsidiary, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), and Con Edisons competitive businesses (discussed below) in Con Edisons consolidated financial statements. The term Utilities is used in these notes to refer to Con Edison of New York and O&R.
As used in these notes, the term Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, Con Edison of New York makes no representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.
Con Edison has two regulated utility subsidiaries: Con Edison of New York and O&R. Con Edison of New York provides electric service and gas service in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. Con Edison has the following competitive energy businesses: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R, and also offers energy-related services; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; and Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects.
In December 2004, after a comprehensive strategic review, Con Edison determined to sell Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications). See Note U.
Note A  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Companies consolidated financial statements include the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (see Note Q), as required. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No.71.
The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Other significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced below in this Note A and in the notes that follow.
Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property is charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement, the original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation. See Note R.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate of return on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC or the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the 75 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities own funds are credited to other income (deductions). The AFDC rates for Con Edison of New York were 7.4 percent, 6.9 percent and 7.1 percent for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The AFDC rates for O&R were 3.9 percent, 3.6 percent and 1.1 percent for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The Utilities generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors. The average depreciation rates for Con Edison of New York were 2.9 percent for 2005 and 3.0 percent for 2004 and 2003. The average depreciation rates for O&R were 2.9 percent for 2005 and 2004 and 3.1 percent for 2003, respectively.
The estimated lives for utility plant for Con Edison of New York range from 25 to 80 years for electric, 15 to 85 years for gas, 30 to 70 years for steam and 8 to 50 years for general plant. For O&R, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 65 years for electric, 7 to 75 years for gas and 5 to 55 years for general plant.
At December31, 2005 and 2004, the capitalized cost of the Companies utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, was as follows: Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Electric Generation $ 289 $ 381 $ 289 $ 381 Transmission 1,479 1,361 1,387 1,262 Distribution 8,814 8,147 8,324 7,691 Gas* 2,448 2,310 2,176 2,056 Steam 1,397 623 1,397 623 General 1,008 987 928 910 Held for future use 5 5 4 4 Construction work in progress 771 1,354 739 1,328 Net Utility Plant $ 16,211 $ 15,168 $ 15,244 $ 14,255 * Primarily distribution.
Non-Utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication facilities that are currently not used within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edisons competitive businesses, non-utility plant consists primarily of electric generating facilities. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 70 years.
The average non-utility depreciation rates for Con Edison Development were 2.8 percent, 2.7 percent and 3.0 percent for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In accordance with SFAS No.34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, Con Edison capitalizes interest on its borrowings associated with the competitive businesses capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such capitalized interest cost for 2003 was $6 million. There was no capitalized interest cost in 2004 and 2005.
Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. See Note L.
Impairments In accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Companies evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets, based on projections of undiscounted future cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event an evaluation indicates that such cash flows cannot be expected to be sufficient to fully recover the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value. See Note U.
Revenues The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas and steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period net interruptible gas revenues, other than those authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to be retained by the Utilities, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. O&R and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy service not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Con Edison of New York estimates its unbilled revenues at December31, 2005 and 2004 to be approximately $432 million and $380 million, respectively. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edisons balance sheet at December31, 2005 and 2004 were $116 million and $73 million, respectively.
76 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The PSC requires utilities to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is included in the revenue requirement within each of the respective PSC approved rate plans.
Recoverable Energy Costs The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy supply costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference in most cases is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed electric and steam supply costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). For the Utilities gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a subsequent 12-month period.
New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) The Utilities purchase electricity through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The difference between purchased power and related costs initially billed to the Utilities by the NYISO and the actual cost of power subsequently calculated by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities customers. At December31, 2005 and 2004, Con Edison of New York had deferred $20 million and $160 million, respectively, of funds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability to be applied for customer benefit.
Certain other payments to or receipts from the NYISO are also subject to reconciliation, with shortfalls or amounts in excess of specified rate allowances recoverable from or refundable to customers. These include proceeds from the sale through the NYISO of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system (Transmission Congestion Contracts or TCCs). For Con Edison of New York, TCC sales proceeds in excess of $60 million are deferred as a regulatory liability to be applied for customer benefit and do not affect net income.
Sulfur Dioxide Allowances In accordance with the federal Clean Air Act, the Utilities have been allocated sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances which the Utilities may sell, trade or hold for future use. Generally, the Utilities defer their proceeds from the sale of SO 2 allowances as regulatory liabilities to be applied for customer benefit. See Note B. For the competitive energy businesses, sales of SO 2 allowances are reflected in earnings in the periods in which the sales occur. The proceeds received from the sale of S0 2 allowances are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies Statements of Cash Flows.
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly-liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edisons competitive businesses, which are recorded at cost or accounted for under the equity method (depending on the subsidiaries percentage ownership) or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No.13, Accounting for Leases. See Note K for a discussion of investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions.
Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or turn-around of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense. See Notes B and M. In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No.109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays or receives an amount based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.
77 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed effective January 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June 2001, the PSC authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and the actual tax expense under the new tax law until that expense is incorporated in base rates. For Con Edison of New York, effective October 2004, state income tax is being recovered through base rates for its gas and steam businesses and effective April 2005, for its electric business. For O&R, state income tax is being recovered through base rates for its electric and gas businesses effective November 2003.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives an amount based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs were as follows: FortheYearsEndedDecember31, (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison $ 14 $ 11 $ 11 Con Edison of New York $ 14 $ 10 $ 10 Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Earnings Per Common Share In accordance with SFAS No.128, Earnings per Share, Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders (Net income on Con Edisons consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.
Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock, deferred common shares and stock options for which the average market price of the common shares for the period was greater than the exercise price. See Note N.
Basic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows: (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts/Shares in Millions) For the Years Ended December31, 2005 2004 2003 Income from continuing operations $ 732 $ 549 $ 634 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (13 ) (12 ) (109 ) Income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 719 537 525 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax - - 3 Net income $ 719 $ 537 $ 528 Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic 243.9 235.8 220.9 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities 0.8 0.6 0.9 Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding  Diluted 244.7 236.4 221.8 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  BASIC Continuing operations $ 3.00 $ 2.33 $ 2.87 Discontinued operations (0.05 ) (0.05 ) (0.50 ) Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 2.95 2.28 2.37 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles - - 0.02 Net income $ 2.95 $ 2.28 $ 2.39 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  DILUTED Continuing operations $ 2.99 $ 2.32 $ 2.86 Discontinued operations (0.05 ) (0.05 ) (0.50 ) Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 2.94 2.27 2.36 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles - - 0.02 Net income $ 2.94 $ 2.27 $ 2.38 The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes 0.9million, 4.4million and 4.1million Con Edison common shares for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, because the average closing market price of the common shares during these periods exceeds the exercise prices on the options.
Stock-Based Compensation Con Edison accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value model of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations. See Note N.
78 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No.148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure  An Amendment of FASB Statement No.123, for the purposes of recognizing compensation expense on employee stock-based arrangements.
Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Net income, as reported $ 719 $ 537 $ 528 $ 705 $ 529 $ 602 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 6 7 3 5 5 3 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of related tax effects 10 12 8 8 9 7 Pro forma net income $ 715 $ 532 $ 523 $ 702 $ 525 $ 598 Earnings per common share: Basic  as reported $ 2.95 $ 2.28 $ 2.39 Basic  pro forma $ 2.93 $ 2.26 $ 2.37 Diluted  as reported $ 2.94 $ 2.27 $ 2.38 Diluted  pro forma $ 2.92 $ 2.25 $ 2.36 Certain of Con Edisons stock-based compensation plans allow employees to continue vesting in an award in accordance with the stated vesting terms even though the employee has retired from the company. In its pro forma disclosures, Con Edison has historically recognized compensation cost over the employees nominal vesting period with any remaining compensation cost recognized at the date of retirement (the nominal vesting period approach). The pro forma compensation cost would not have materially increased had the company recognized compensation cost immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees and over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period (non-substantive vesting period approach).
Con Edison plans to adopt the non-substantive vesting period approach in connection with its implementation of SFAS 123 (R), Share-Based Payment. See Note N.
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Note B  Regulatory Matters Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended March31, 2002, the divestiture of most of the companys electric generating capacity, and a reasonable opportunity for recovery of strandable costs (costs that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market).
At December31, 2005, approximately 190,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing approximately 31 percent of aggregate customer peak demand were purchasing electricity from other suppliers under the electric retail access program (which is available to all of the companys electric customers). The company delivers electricity to participating customers in this program through its regulated transmission and distribution systems. In general, its delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable customers, less the cost of supplying customers with energy and capacity.
In November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that revised and extended the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000.
79 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December 2001, 35 percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March 2002 through 2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity were to be retained for shareholders and the balance was to be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. There was no sharing of earnings for the rate years ended March 2002 and 2005. In 2002 and 2003, Con Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve totaling $49 million for the rate year ending March 2003. In 2004, an electric shared earnings reserve of less than $1 million for the rate year ending March 2004 was established. In addition, the company recorded penalties relating to reliability standards tied to targets established in regulatory proceedings of $2 million, $8 million and $3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continued the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers its potential strandable costs and its purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A.
In March 2005, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for electric delivery service (the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement). The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement covers the three-year period April 2005 through March 2008, and provides for increases in electric base rates of $104.6 million, effective April1, 2005, and $220.4 million, effective April1, 2007. In addition, the company will retain the first $60 million of auction proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on the companys transmission system (transmission congestion contracts) in each of the three years. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to increase electric revenues by $128 million, $173 million and $249 million in the first, second and third rate years, respectively.
The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement provides for annual reconciliations of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation (Net T&D) and the actual amount of certain operating costs experienced over the term of the agreement, as compared in each case to the amounts reflected in electric rates.
If the actual Net T&D is greater than the Net T&D reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory asset and increase its revenues by the revenue requirement impact of such difference (i.e., a return on investment, depreciation and income taxes). If the actual Net T&D is less than the Net T&D reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory liability and decrease its revenues by the revenue requirement impact of such difference.
At December31, 2005, a regulatory asset of $38 million was deferred related to this reconciliation.
If the actual amount of pension or other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs and, if the variation exceeds 2.5 percent, property taxes or the cost of moving facilities to avoid interfering with government projects is greater than the respective amount for each such cost reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory asset for the difference and defer recognition in income of the difference. If the actual amount is less than the amount reflected in electric rates, the company will accrue a regulatory liability for the difference and decrease its revenues by the amount of such difference. Any regulatory asset resulting from these cost reconciliations is subject to offset, as described below, if the company earns, excluding the effect of the incentives and penalties discussed below (Adjusted Earnings), between an 11.4 percent and a 13 percent return on equity (based on the companys actual capitalization, subject to a maximum equity ratio of 50 percent). No regulatory asset is to be accrued if Adjusted Earnings exceed a 13 percent return on equity.
Under the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, any Adjusted Earnings between an 11.4 percent and a 13 percent return on equity are to be used to offset 50 percent of any regulatory asset resulting from the cost reconciliation. The company can retain 50 percent of any remaining above-target Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers. If Adjusted Earnings exceed a 13 percent return, the company can retain 25 percent of the above-target Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers.
The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement also provided for the continuation of the rate provisions pursuant to which the company recovers its potential strandable costs and its purchased power and fuel costs from customers.
The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement included potential positive earnings adjustments (incentives) if the company meets certain standards for its retail access and demand side management programs, and potential negative earnings adjustments (penalties), which could be substantial, if it does not meet certain standards for (i)frequency and duration of service interruptions; (ii)major outages; (iii)repair, removal or replacement of damaged poles, temporary shunts, street lights, traffic signals and circuit breakers; and (iv)customer service. In 2005, an $8 million penalty for not meeting certain standards for duration of service interruptions was recorded.
In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, the company recognized a $100 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to 80 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to prior period pension credits.
In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, at December31, 2005, Con Edison of New York estimated that its Adjusted Earnings above 11.4 percent for the rate year ending March31, 2006 would exceed the target sharing level by $59 million, of which $47 million was applied to reduce regulatory assets arising from the cost reconciliations, and $6 million was reserved for customer benefit.
In 1997, the PSC approved a four-year O&R restructuring plan pursuant to which O&R sold all of its generating assets and made retail access available to all of its electric customers effective May 1999. In 1998 and 1999, similar plans for O&Rs utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were approved by state regulators.
In October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among O&R, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates O&R can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covers the period from July 2003 through October 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million (pre tax) over the period covered by the agreement. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis. It also provides for O&R to share equally with customers earnings above a 12.75 percent return on common equity during the three-year period from July 2003 through June 2006. Beginning July 2006, O&R will not be subject to earnings sharing.
In July 2003, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company (RECO) for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7 million decrease in RECOs electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECOs recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest. At December31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for $13 million of the disallowance, and at June30, 2003 reserved an additional $6 million for the disallowance.
In July 2004, the NJBPU approved RECOs Phase II petition to increase base rates annually by $2.7 million (2.0% increase), effective August1, 2004. The Phase II decision provides for the recovery of carrying costs for two substation projects and specified additional reliability programs. Also in July 2004, a special purpose entity formed by RECO (which is included in the consolidated financial statements of Con Edison) issued $46 million of 5.22% Transition Bonds and used the proceeds thereof to purchase from RECO the right to be paid a Transition Bond Charge (TBC) and associated tax charges by its customers relating to the balance of previously deferred purchased power costs, discussed above. The TBC replaced a Transition Recovery Charge, a temporary surcharge that was effective August1, 2003.
Pike County Light& Power Company (Pike) is obligated under Pennsylvania law to serve those customers who do not purchase electricity from other suppliers. In January 2006, Pike began charging new rates to these customers that reflected prices resulting from a competitive auction, overseen and approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). As a result, customers bills increased substantially. Subsequently, the PPUC initiated a fact-finding investigation into the competitive electric market in Pikes service territory.
Gas In April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced gas rates by $25 million annually.
In September 2004, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for gas and steam services. The approved gas rate plan covers the three-year period October 2004 through September 2007, and provided for an increase in gas base rates of $46.8 million, effective October1, 2004, with deferral accounting to be used to allocate the income statement effect of the increase over the term of the agreement. The rate increase is net of a $17.5 million pre-tax charge to gas operating revenues, which the company recognized in 2004, to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. In addition to this rate increase, the company will retain the first $35 million of net revenues from non-firm customer transactions in each year of the plan. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to increase gas revenues by $41 million over the period of the three-year rate plan.
Additional provisions of the gas rate plan include: equal sharing with customers of earnings above an 11.75 percent return on common equity (based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum common equity ratio of 50 percent of capitalization); reconciliation of pension and other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the gas business to the 81 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers; opportunities to retain for shareholders a percentage of annual gas net revenues from non-firm customer transactions (20 percent of revenues between $35 million and $50 million, 25 percent between $50 million and $70 million and 10 percent over $70 million), and to earn an incentive of up to $8.5 million over the period of the rate plan depending upon the number of customers that migrate to retail access; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of purchased gas and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; continuation of provisions pursuant to which the effects of weather on gas income are moderated; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.
In October 2003, the PSC approved a new gas rate agreement among O&R, the PSC staff and other parties. This agreement, which covers the period November 2003 through October 2006, provides for increases in gas base rates of $9 million (5.8 percent) effective November 2003, $9 million (4.8 percent) effective November 2004 and $5 million (2.5 percent) effective November 2005. The agreement provides for O&R to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity. It continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to increase gas revenues by $2 million over the period of the three-year rate plan.
In May 2005, the PPUC approved an increase to the rates Pike charges for gas service by $0.1 million (8.7%), effective June1, 2005.
In November 2005, O&R filed a request with the PSC for an increase in the rates it charges for gas service, effective November1, 2006, of $24 million (4.7%). The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11 percent and a common equity ratio of 48.9 percent of capitalization. The filing includes a proposal for a three-year plan, with additional increases effective November1, 2007 and 2008 of $2.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The filing proposes continuation of the current gas rate plan provisions with respect to the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to gas to the amounts reflected in rates for pension and other postemployment benefit costs, property taxes, interference, environmental remediation and research and development costs.
Steam In November 2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that provided for a $17 million steam rate increase in October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. The agreement continued the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovered purchased steam and fuel costs on a current basis.
In September 2004, the PSC approved a steam rate plan covering the two-year period October 2004 through September 2006. The plan provides for increases in steam base rates of $49.6 million, effective October1, 2004, and $27.4 million, effective October1, 2005. The increases are net of a $6.2 million pre-tax charge to steam operating revenues, which the company recognized in 2004 to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to decrease steam revenues by $3 million over the period of the two-year rate plan.
Additional provisions of the steam rate plan include: equal sharing with customers of earnings in excess of an 11.75 percent return on common equity (based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum common equity ratio of 50 percent of capitalization); reconciliation of pension and other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the steam business to the amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of fuel and purchased steam and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.
In April 2005, Con Edison of New York commenced commercial operation of the East River Repowering Project (ERRP) and retired its Waterside generating station. Under the steam rate plan, the company credited customers with the estimated net monthly fuel savings from the ERRP until the plant was in service. The company will recover all benefits credited to customers during the period January 2005 through March 2005 over the subsequent 18 months.
In November 2005, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for a net increase in the rates it charges for steam service, effective October1, 2006, of $68 million (9.6 percent).
82 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11 percent and a common equity ratio of 49 percent. The filing includes a proposal for a three-year rate plan, with additional increases effective October1, 2007 and 2008 of $15 million and $12 million, respectively. The filing proposes continuation of the current steam rate plan provisions with respect to recovery from customers of the cost of fuel and purchased steam, environmental remediation expenses and the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to steam to the amounts reflected in rates for pension and other post-employment benefit costs, property taxes and interference costs.
In December 2005, the PSC issued an order regarding a steam business development plan developed by a task force on which Con Edison of New York, governmental, consumer, environmental and steam producer representatives participated. The PSC characterized negatively the companys steam business development efforts and ordered the company to implement certain of the plans recommendations, including developing account management and geographic information systems, and preparing steam resource and targeted marketing plans, strengthening relationships with customers advisors and vendors of steam equipment and promoting hybrid chiller systems (which would use steam for cooling purposes during periods of high electric demand). Certain of the recommendations were reflected in the companys pending steam rate request and others may also be considered in connection with the request.
83 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Regulatory assets and liabilities at December31, 2005 and 2004 were comprised of the following items: Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Regulatory assets Future federal income tax $ 952 $ 762 $ 902 $ 715 Environmental remediation costs 241 165 182 106 World Trade Center restoration costs 127 104 127 104 Recoverable energy costs 120 81 120 81 Pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals 96 42 46 - O&R Transition bond charges 70 74 - - Revenue taxes 59 46 59 46 Unbilled gas revenue 44 44 44 44 Workers compensation 42 48 42 48 Net T&D reconciliation 38 - 38 - Asbestos-related costs 25 26 25 25 Other retirement program costs 24 29 24 29 Sale costs  First Avenue properties - 178 - 178 Sale of nuclear generating plant including interest - 176 - 176 Electric interference costs - 44 - 44 NYS tax law changes - 40 - 40 Electric cost reconciliations (47 ) - (47 ) - Other 235 205 220 193 Regulatory Assets 2,026 2,064 1,782 1,829 Recoverable energy costs  current 221 194 192 176 Total Regulatory Assets $ 2,247 $ 2,258 $ 1,974 $ 2,005 Regulatory liabilities Allowance for cost of removal less salvage $ 558 $ 723 $ 501 $ 666 Net electric deferrals 288 - 288 - Gain on sale of First Avenue properties 256 - 256 - Transmission congestion contracts 163 391 163 391 2004 electric, gas and steam one-time rate plan charges 121 124 121 124 Prior year deferred tax amortization 81 - 81 - EPA SO 2 Allowance Proceeds  electric and steam 76 20 76 20 Utilities hedging unrealized gains 75 2 59 - NYS tax law changes 51 44 39 32 Interest on federal income tax refund 41 37 41 37 O&R Refundable energy costs 40 29 - - Property tax reconciliation 31 1 31 1 NYISO reconciliation 20 160 20 160 DC service incentive 17 33 17 33 Gas interference  cost sharing 9 11 9 11 Gas interruptible sales credits 8 22 8 22 Earnings sharing reserve 7 50 7 50 Excess dividends tax 4 18 4 18 Gain on divestiture - 56 - 55 Other 216 278 203 267 Regulatory Liabilities 2,062 1,999 1,924 1,887 Deferred derivative gains  current 224 23 170 8 Total Regulatory Liabilities $ 2,286 $ 2,022 $ 2,094 $ 1,895 84 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Net electric deferrals represents the remaining unamortized balance of certain regulatory assets and liabilities of Con Edison of New York that were combined effective April1, 2005 and are being amortized to income over the period April 2005 through March 2008, in accordance with the electric rate plan discussed above.
The $81 million prior year deferred tax amortization represents the revenue equivalent of $48 million for the amortization of deferred taxes in the years 2000 to 2004 that was not recorded during that period. The correction was recognized in 2005 with this balance deferred as a regulatory liability pending disposition by the PSC.
Other Regulatory Matters In May 2005, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of certain properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan. Net proceeds from the sale received at closing totaled $534 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $256 million. In accordance with the PSC order approving the sale of the properties, the company has deferred the net gain for the benefit of customers. The net after-tax gain on the sale, including additional expenses to be incurred, is estimated at $114 million. There may be additional proceeds in the event of certain zoning changes or other developments.
Note C  Capitalization Common Stock At December31, 2005 and 2004, Con Edison owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Utilities. Con Edison of New York owns 21,976,200 shares of Con Edison stock, which it purchased prior to 2001 in connection with Con Edisons stock repurchase plan. Con Edison of New York presents in the financial statements the cost of the Con Edison stock it owns as a reduction of common shareholders equity.
Capitalization of Con Edison The outstanding capitalization for each of the Companies is shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization, and for Con Edison includes the Utilities outstanding preferred stock and debt.
Preferred Stock of Con Edison of New York As of December31, 2005, 1,915,319 shares of Con Edison of New Yorks $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock (the $5 Preferred) and 375,626 shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value) were outstanding.
Dividends on the $5 Preferred Stock are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $4.65 per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred dividends must be declared by Con Edison of New Yorks Board of Trustees to become payable. See Dividends below.
With respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison (which owns all of the 235,488,094 shares of Con Edison of New Yorks common stock that are outstanding) and the holders of the $5 Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock have no right to vote; provided, however, that if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share with respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods, the holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the election of Con Edison of New Yorks Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, Con Edison of New York may not create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. Con Edison of New York may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $101 per share (in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends). In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the companys common stock, the holders of the $5 Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled to receive $100 per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case together with all accrued and unpaid dividends.
Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities generally pay are limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of income available for dividends are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiarys equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.
In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New Yorks common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative 85 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Preferred Stock have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.
Long-term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2006-2010 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison Con Edison ofNewYork 2006 $ 22 $ - 2007 374 330 2008 507 280 2009 491 475 2010 701 625 The Utilities have issued certain series of tax-exempt debt through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) that currently bear interest at a rate determined weekly and, in certain circumstances, is subject to mandatory tender for purchase by the Utilities.
Long-term debt is stated at cost, which in total, as of December31, 2005, approximates fair value (estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities), except for $225 million of Con Edison of New Yorks tax-exempt financing. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note P.
At December31, 2005 and 2004, long-term debt of Con Edison included $23 million of mortgage bonds collateralized by substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of O&Rs New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries and for 2004, $46 million of Transition Bonds issued by O&Rs New Jersey utility subsidiary through a special purpose entity. See Note B. At December31, 2005 and 2004, long-term debt of Con Edison included: $115 million and $128 million, respectively, of non-recourse debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a pledge of the Lakewood power plant, a related power purchase agreement and project assets; and $333 million and $336 million, respectively, of debt secured by the Newington power plant and related assets. See Note Q. At December31, 2005 and 2004, restricted cash relating to the operations of the Lakewood plant was $11 million and $16 million, respectively.
Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison or Con Edison of New York, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below. The Companies believe that they were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at December31, 2005.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. The arrangements include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied might and, in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.
The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($100 million for Con Edison of New York).
Note D  Short Term Borrowing In April 2005, Con Edison and the Utilities entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement, under which banks committed to provide loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $937.5 million, and terminated a three-year credit agreement that was to expire in November 2005. Bank commitments under the new revolving credit agreement and an existing three-year credit agreement that expires in November 2006 total $1.5 billion, with the full amount available to Con Edison of New York and $500 million available to Con Edison, the parent company. Neither Con Edison nor either of the Utilities is responsible for the obligations under the credit agreements of any company other than itself. The credit agreements support the Companies commercial paper program.
At December31, 2005, Con Edison had $755 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $520 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks program, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.3 percent. At December31, 2004, Con Edison had $156 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $100 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks program, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.2 percent.
86 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The banks commitments under the credit agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no event of default. The commitments are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change. Upon a change of control of, or upon an event of default by one of the Companies, the banks may terminate their commitments with respect to that company and declare any amounts owed by that company under the credit agreements immediately due and payable. Events of default include the exceeding at any time of a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital of 0.65 to 1 (at December31, 2005, this ratio was 0.52 to 1 for Con Edison and 0.50 to 1 for Con Edison of New York); having liens on its assets in an aggregate amount exceeding 5 percent of its consolidated total capital, subject to certain exceptions; and the failure by the company, following any applicable notice period, to meet certain other customary covenants. The fees charged for the revolving credit facilities and any loans made or letters of credit issued under the credit agreements reflect the Companies respective credit ratings. At December31, 2005, $13 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the agreements.
See Note S for information about short-term borrowing between related parties.
Note E  Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York and O&R and certain employees of Con Edisons competitive businesses. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In addition, Con Edison maintains additional non-qualified supplemental pension plans.
Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period. This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which provides a corridor method for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
Effective April1, 2005, in accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement and October1, 2004, in accordance with the gas and steam Joint Proposal, Con Edison of New York began deferring the difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the rate allowance. Generally, O&R has also been deferring such difference pursuant to its rate agreements. See Note B.
Con Edison uses a measurement date of December31 for its pension plan.

88 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Assumptions The actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31: Discount rate 5.70% 5.90% 6.30% Rate of compensation increase Con Edison of New York 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% O&R 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31: Discount rate 5.90% 6.30% 6.75% Expected return on plan assets 8.80% 8.80% 8.80% Rate of compensation increase Con Edison of New York 4.00% 4.00% 4.30% O&R 4.00% 4.00% 4.15% The expected return assumption reflects anticipated returns on the plans current and future assets. The Companies use historical investment data as well as the plans target asset class and investment management mix to determine the expected return on plan assets. This analysis incorporates such factors as real return, inflation, and expected investment manager performance for each broad asset class applicable to the plan. Historical plan performance and peer data are also reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.
Discount Rate Assumption To determine the assumed discount rate, the Companies use a model that produces a yield curve based on yields on selected highly rated (Aaa or Aa, by Moodys Investors Service) corporate bonds. Bonds with insufficient liquidity, bonds with questionable pricing information and bonds that are not representative of the overall market are excluded from consideration. For example, the bonds used in the model cannot be callable, they must have a price between 50 and 200, the yield must lie between 1 percent and 20 percent, and the amount of the issue must be in excess of $100 million. The spot rates defined by the yield curve and the plans projected benefit payments are used to develop a weighted average discount rate.
Expected Benefit Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years: (Millions of dollars) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011- 2015 Con Edison $ 378 $ 399 $ 421 $ 442 $ 465 $ 2,642 Con Edison of NewYork 351 371 392 412 433 2,461 Expected Contributions Based on current estimates, the Companies are not required under funding regulations and laws to make any contributions to the pension plan during 2006. The Companies policy is to fund their accounting cost to the extent tax deductible, therefore, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York expect to make discretionary contributions of $70 million and $34 million, respectively, to the pension plan during 2006.
Plan Assets The asset allocations for the pension plan at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the target allocation for 2006 are as follows: Target Allocation PlanAssets atDecember31, Asset Category 2006 2005 2004 2003 Equity Securities 65% 67% 67% 64% Debt Securities 30% 28% 28% 32% Real Estate 5% 5% 5% 4% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% Con Edison has established a pension trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.
Pursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edisons Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) has general oversight responsibility for Con Edisons pension and other employee benefit plans. The pension plans Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The 89 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edisons chief executive, financial and accounting officers and others the Board of Trustees may appoint in addition to or in place of the designated Named Fiduciaries.
The investment objective for the pension trust is to maximize the long-term total return on the trust assets within a prudent level of risk. The investment strategy is to diversify its funds across asset classes, investment styles and fund managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2006 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2003.
Individual fund managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an ongoing basis, and reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a regular basis. Changes in fund managers and rebalancing of the portfolio are undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries approve such changes, which are also reported to the Committee.
The Companies also offer a defined contribution savings plan that covers substantially all employees and made contributions to the plan as follows: FortheYears EndedDecember31, (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Con Edison $ 19 $ 19 $ 18 Con Edison of New York 17 17 17 Note F  Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities currently have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses.
Con Edison of New York also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. O&R has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees. Certain employees of Con Edisons competitive businesses are eligible to receive benefits under these programs.
Investment plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for the Companies. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.
The Utilities generally defer any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and the current rate allowances for their electric, gas and steam operations.
Con Edison uses a measurement date of December31 for its other postretirement benefit plans.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost The components of the Companies net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Service cost $ 14 $ 11 $ 10 $ 10 $ 8 $ 8 Interest cost on accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation 84 74 82 74 66 73 Expected return on plan assets (79 ) (79 ) (78 ) (73 ) (74 ) (74 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 72 40 46 63 35 41 Amortization of prior service cost (15 ) (15 ) (16 ) (15 ) (15 ) (15 ) Amortization of transition obligation 4 4 4 4 4 4 Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost $ 80 $ 35 $ 48 $ 63 $ 24 $ 37 Cost capitalized (25 ) (10 ) (15 ) (21 ) (7 ) (11 ) Cost deferred (24 ) 11 (3 ) (18 ) 12 - Cost charged to operating expenses $ 31 $ 36 $ 30 $ 24 $ 29 $ 26 90 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Funded Status The funded status of the programs at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,315 $ 1,238 $ 1,248 $ 1,157 $ 1,107 $ 1,116 Service cost 14 11 10 10 8 8 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 84 74 82 74 66 73 Net actuarial loss 244 117 99 221 91 89 Benefits paid and administrative expenses (108 ) (102 ) (91 ) (97 ) (92 ) (83 ) Participant contributions 19 19 18 18 19 18 Medicare prescription benefit - (42 ) (128 ) - (42 ) (114 ) Benefit Obligation at End of Year $ 1,568 $ 1,315 $ 1,238 $ 1,383 $ 1,157 $ 1,107 Change in Plan Assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 882 $ 839 $ 717 $ 826 $ 790 $ 674 Actual return on plan assets 59 91 145 56 87 143 Employer contributions 71 31 46 58 22 38 Participant contributions 18 19 18 18 19 18 Benefits paid (104 ) (98 ) (87 ) (97 ) (92 ) (83 ) Fair Value of Plan Assets at End of Year $ 926 $ 882 $ 839 $ 861 $ 826 $ 790 Funded status $ (642 ) $ (433 ) $ (399 ) $ (522 ) $ (331 ) $ (317 ) Unrecognized net loss 576 386 363 496 322 319 Unrecognized prior service costs (104 ) (119 ) (133 ) (103 ) (118 ) (132 ) Unrecognized net transition liability at January1, 1993 26 29 33 26 29 33 Accrued Postretirement Benefit Cost $ (144 ) $ (137 ) $ (136 ) $ (103 ) $ (98 ) $ (97 ) * Being amortized over a period of 20 years and reduced by an additional amount in 2002 due to plan amendments.
Assumptions The actuarial assumptions were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December31: Discount Rate 5.70% 5.90% 6.30% Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31: Discount Rate 5.90% 6.30% 6.75% Expected Return on Plan Assets Tax-Exempt 8.80% 8.80% 8.80% Taxable Con Edison of New York 7.80% 7.80% 7.80% O&R 8.30% 8.30% 8.30% Refer to Note E for descriptions of the basis for determining the expected return on assets, investment policies and strategies, and the assumed discount rate.
The health care cost trend rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December31, 2005 was 10 percent, which is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 percent by 2011 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate used to determine benefit obligations for the year ended December31, 2005 was 9 percent, which is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 percent by 2011 and remain at that level thereafter.
91 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects at December31, 2005: Con Edison ConEdisonofNewYork 1-Percentage-Point (Millions of Dollars) Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Effect on accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation $ 36 $ 29 $ 17 $ 13 Effect on service cost and interest cost components for 2005 3 2 1 1 Expected Benefit Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years: (Millions of Dollars) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011- 2015 Gross benefit payments Con Edison $ 99 $ 108 $ 113 $ 117 $ 122 $ 655 Con Edison of New York 88 97 100 104 108 579 Medicare prescription benefit receipts Con Edison $ 8 $ 9 $ 10 $ 11 $ 12 $ 72 Con Edison of New York 8 8 9 10 11 64 Expected Contributions Based on current estimates, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York expect to make contributions of $64 million and $51 million, respectively, to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2006.
Plan Assets The asset allocations for Con Edison of New Yorks other postretirement benefit plans at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the target allocation for 2006 are as follows: Target Allocation PlanAssets atDecember31, Asset Category 2006 2005 2004 2003 Equity Securities 65% 66% 66% 62% Debt Securities 35% 34% 34% 38% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% Con Edison has established postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.
Refer to Note E for a discussion of Con Edisons investment policy for its benefit plans.
Effect of Medicare Prescription Benefit In December 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-2, issued by the FASB in May 2004, provides accounting and disclosure requirements relating to the Act. The Companies actuaries have determined that each prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20 years; therefore, the Companies are eligible to receive the benefit that the Act makes available. When the plans benefits are no longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan, 25% of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the Companies prescription programs.
To reflect the effect of the Act on the plans, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were reduced for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York by $206 million and $178 million, respectively, as of December31, 2005. The 2005 postretirement benefit costs were reduced by $28 million for Con Edison and $24 million for Con Edison of New York. The Companies will recognize the 28 percent benefit (reflected as an unrecognized net gain to each plan) as an offset to plan costs. The 28 percent benefit is expected to reduce prescription drug plan costs by about 25 percent starting in 2006.
Note G  Environmental Matters Superfund Sites Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and 92 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued remediation costs (which includes costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring) and environmental damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas plant sites, are referred to herein as Superfund Sites.
For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas plant sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.
The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Accrued Liabilities: Manufactured gas plant sites $ 173 $ 148 $ 121 $ 92 Other Superfund Sites 65 50 65 49 Total $ 238 $ 198 $ 186 $ 141 Regulatory assets $ 241 $ 165 $ 182 $ 106 Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. As investigations progress on these and other sites, the Utilities expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. Under their current rate agreements, the Utilities are permitted to recover or defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) certain site investigation and remediation costs.
Environmental remediation costs incurred and insurance recoveries received related to Superfund Sites at December31, 2005 and 2004, were as follows: ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Remediation costs incurred $ 46 $ 47 $ 41 $ 44 Insurance recoveries received 2 * 36 ** 2 * 36 ** * Reduced amount deferred for recovery from customers.
** $35 million reduced amount deferred for recovery from customers and $1 million reduced related expenses.
In 2002, Con Edison of New York estimated that for its manufactured gas plant sites, most of which had not been investigated, its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range from approximately $65 million to $1.1 billion. In 2004, O&R estimated that for its manufactured gas plant sites, each of which has been investigated, the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range from approximately $31 million to $87 million. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at each of the sites and additional assumptions regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different.
Asbestos Proceedings Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. In 2004, Con Edison of New York estimated that its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional suits that may be brought over the next 15 years is $25 million. The estimate was based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different.
In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Under its current rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is permitted to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) liabilities incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers compensation claims.
93 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for the Companies at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Accrued liability  asbestos suits $ 25 $ 26 $ 25 $ 25 Regulatoryassetsasbestossuits $ 25 $ 26 $ 25 $ 25 Accrued liability  workers compensation $ 118 $ 122 $ 113 $ 119 Regulatory assets  workers compensation $ 42 $ 48 $ 42 $ 48 Note H  Northeast Utilities Litigation In March 2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court), entitled Consolidated Edison, Inc. v. Northeast Utilities (the First Federal Proceeding), seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edisons obligation to complete its acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January11, 2000 (the merger agreement). In May 2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As amended, Con Edisons complaint seeks, among other things, recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, and the District Courts declaration that under the merger agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to Northeast Utilities and Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison.
In June 2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March 2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim in the First Federal Proceeding its claim that Con Edison materially breached the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the consideration to be paid to Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock (the so-called lost premium claim), expenditures in connection with regulatory approvals and lost business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $26.00 per share (an estimated aggregate of not more than $3.9 billion) plus $0.0034 per share for each day after August5, 2000 through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in stock.
In March 2003, the District Court ruled on certain motions filed by Con Edison and Northeast Utilities in the First Federal Proceeding. The District Court ruled that Con Edisons claim against Northeast Utilities for hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of the merger agreement, as well as Con Edisons claim that Northeast Utilities underwent a material adverse change, will go to trial. The District Court also dismissed Con Edisons fraud and misrepresentation claims. In addition, the District Court ruled that Northeast Utilities shareholders were intended third-party beneficiaries of the merger agreement and the alleged $1.2 billion lost premium claim against Con Edison would go to trial.
In May 2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities shareholders, entitled Rimkoski, et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc., was filed in New York County Supreme Court (the State Proceeding) alleging breach of the merger agreement. The complaint defined the putative class as holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March5, 2001, and alleged that the class members were intended third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement. The complaint sought damages believed to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities on behalf of its shareholders in the First Federal Proceeding. In December 2003, the District Court granted Rimkoskis motion to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding and, in February 2004, the State Proceeding was dismissed without prejudice. In January 2004, Rimkoski filed a motion in the First Federal Proceeding to certify his action as a class action on behalf of all holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March5, 2001 and to appoint Rimkoski as class representative. The motion is pending.
In May 2004, the District Court ruled that the Northeast Utilities shareholders who may pursue the lost premium claim against Con Edison are the holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March5, 2001 and the District Court therefore dismissed Northeast Utilities lost premium claim. The District Court certified its ruling regarding the lost premium claim for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Court of Appeals), and in June 2004 Northeast Utilities filed its motion for leave to appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals. The District Court further certified for interlocutory appeal its March 2003 determination that Northeast Utilities shareholders are intended third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement, and in June 2004 Con Edison filed its motion for leave to appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals. In October 2004, the Court of Appeals granted both Con Edisons motion and Northeast Utilities motion. In October 2005, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts March 2003 ruling that Northeast Utilities shareholders were intended third-party beneficiaries of the merger agreement, and held that Northeast Utilities shareholders therefore could not sue Con Edison for the claimed lost premium. Also, in October 2005, Northeast Utilities 94 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued and Rimkowski each filed petitions for rehearing of that Court of Appeals decision. In January 2006, the petitions for rehearing were denied.
In May 2004, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit that was commenced in October 2003 by a purported class of Northeast Utilities shareholders, entitled Siegel et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc. (the Second Federal Proceeding). The Second Federal Proceeding had sought unspecified injunctive relief and damages believed to be substantially duplicative of the damages sought from Con Edison in the First Federal Proceeding. A motion by the plaintiffs in the Second Federal Proceeding to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding is pending.
Con Edison believes that Northeast Utilities materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con Edison did not materially breach the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it was not obligated to acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities did not meet the merger agreements conditions that Northeast Utilities perform all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Those obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement were true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect to Northeast Utilities.
Con Edison is unable to predict whether or not any Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edisons financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Note I  Other Material Contingencies Lower Manhattan Restoration Con Edison of New York estimates that its costs for emergency response to the September11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and for resulting temporary and subsequent permanent restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged in the attack will total $430 million, net of insurance payments. Most of the costs, which are capital in nature, have already been incurred. At December31, 2005, the company had received reimbursement for $169 million of these costs ($76 million under insurance policies and $93 million from the federal government). The company expects to receive additional funds from insurance policies and federal reimbursement. At December31, 2005, the company had incurred capital costs of $193 million and, pursuant to a petition it filed with the PSC in 2001, deferred non-capital costs of $135 million, including interest, as a regulatory asset (these amounts are net of reimbursements received). The company expects the PSC to permit recovery from customers of the costs, net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings.
Suits brought on behalf of several thousand plaintiffs alleged to have been working at the World Trade Center site following the attack are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against numerous parties, including the City of New York, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. The suits generally seek unspecified amounts of damages allegedly resulting from exposure to hazardous substances in connection with emergency response and restoration activities at the site. The Companies believe that their activities were prudent and in compliance with applicable laws. Neither of the Companies, however, is able to predict whether or not any proceedings or other actions relating to the activities will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Based upon New York Citys announced plans for improvement projects in lower Manhattan, the company anticipates that over the next five years it may incur up to $250 million of costs to move its facilities to avoid interfering with these projects. The companys rate plans include provisions for the recovery of such costs. See Note B.
Generating Assets Sold To Mirant In June 1999, O&R completed the sale of all of its generating assets and Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its two-thirds interest in the Bowline Point generating facility to affiliates of Mirant Corporation (formerly Southern Energy, Inc.). The total gross proceeds from the sale amounted to $476 million ($343 million attributable to O&R and $133 million attributable to Con Edison of New York). In 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Effective January3, 2006, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries, but not including the Mirant affiliates to which the O&R and Con Edison of New York generating assets referenced above were sold, emerged from bankruptcy.
The Utilities are parties to an agreement with Mirant and its affiliates tolling the running of any statute of limitations with respect to any claim Mirant or its affiliates may have against the Utilities. Mirant has indicated that it is considering a lawsuit against the Utilities in which it may seek to claim that some portion of what was paid in 1999 to purchase the generating assets exceeded the fair value of the assets.
Mirant has also indicated that it may pursue claims against O&R for compensation for certain system reliability services it alleges it provided to O&R customers since November 1999, as well as claims related to certain of the former O&R facilities.
In addition, Mirant has indicated in certain filings in its bankruptcy proceeding that under certain circumstances it would retire its 95 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Lovett generating units in 2007 and 2008. O&R is in the process of upgrading its transmission and distribution system to meet anticipated demand growth, and believes that by 2007 it would be able to meet existing transmission reliability criteria in the event that the Lovett units were shut down.
The Companies are unable to predict whether or not any Mirant related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Guarantees Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has issued a guarantee on behalf of an entity in which it has an equity interest. Maximum amounts guaranteed by Con Edison totaled $ 1.1 billion and $989 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
A summary, by type and term, of Con Edisons total guarantees at December31, 2005 is as follows: Guarantee Type (Millions of Dollars) 03 years 410 years >10 years Total Commodity transactions $ 780 $ 3 $ 197 $ 980 Affordable housing program - 33 - 33 Intra-company guarantees 40 43 1 84 Other guarantees 32 14 - 46 Total $ 852 $ 93 $ 198 $ 1,143 Commodity Transactions Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a 42 MW foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Affordable Housing Program Con Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with respect to the debt relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue No.94-01, Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects, neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet.
Intra-company Guarantees  $43 million relates to a guarantee issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Communications to Con Edison of New York for payment relating to the use of space in the latters facilities and the construction of new telecommunications underground facilities. (This guarantee will continue subsequent to the sale of Con Edison Communications with respect to facilities in operation at the time of sale. See NoteU.)  $41 million relates to commodity guarantees issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to O&R and Con Edison of New York, respectively.
Other Guarantees Con Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following:  $25 million for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solutions indemnity agreement for surety bonds;  $10 million for certain rent payment obligations of Con Edisons subsidiaries under various lease agreements for office buildings;  $9 million for guarantees, standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration projects; and  $2 million for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities.
Note J  Non-Utility Generators and Other Power Purchase Agreements The Utilities have long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with non-utility generators (NUGs) and others for generating capacity. The Utilities recover their purchase power costs in accordance with provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A.

Note K  Leases Con Edisons subsidiaries lease electric generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No.13, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.
Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered from customers. The following assets under capital leases are included in the Companies consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2005 and 2004: Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Utility Plant Transmission $ 14 $ 16 $ 8 $ 10 Common 25 26 25 26 Total $ 39 $ 42 $ 33 $ 36 The accumulated amortization of the capital leases for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York was $38 million and $37 million, respectively, at December31, 2005, and $35 million and $34 million, respectively, at December31, 2004.
97 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The future minimum lease commitments for the above assets are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork 2006 $ 7 $ 7 2007 7 7 2008 8 8 2009 8 8 2010 7 7 All years thereafter 12 12 Total 49 49 Less: amount representing interest 16 16 Present value of net minimum lease payment $ 33 $ 33 In 2004, Con Edison Development paid $6 million to terminate its future minimum lease commitments with respect to its 330 MW electric generating facility, Ocean Peaking Power, located in Lakewood (NJ).
Con Edison of New York subleases one of its capital leases. The minimum rental to be received in the future under the non-cancelable sublease is $26 million.
Operating leases: The future minimum lease commitments under the Companies non-cancelable operating lease agreements are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) ConEdison ConEdison ofNewYork 2006 $ 45 $ 36 2007 45 37 2008 44 37 2009 44 38 2010 43 39 All years thereafter 194 172 Total $ 415 $ 359 Con Edison of New York has entered into a 10-year Revocable Consent Agreement (the Agreement) with New York City for the use of streets and public places for continued maintenance, operation, installation and removal of transformer vaults, transformers and appurtenant equipment in vaults and on poles and other overhead structures, effective November1, 2004. The Agreement is renewable on one years notice. Payments by the company will increase by 2.8 percent annually, unless adjusted downward to reflect a decrease in the number of transformer vaults and overhead transformers installed.
Lease In/Lease Out Transactions As part of a broad initiative, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reviewing certain categories of transactions. Among these are transactions in which a taxpayer leases property and then immediately subleases it back to the lessor (termed Lease In/Lease Out, or LILO transactions). In 1997 and 1999, Con Edison Development entered into LILO transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, with a total investment of $259 million. The transactions were financed with $93 million of equity and $166 million of non-recourse, long-term debt secured by the underlying assets. In accordance with SFAS No.13, Con Edison is accounting for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the companys investment in these leveraged leases ($225 million and $215 million, respectively) net of deferred tax liabilities ($187 million and $165 million, respectively), amounted to $38 million and $50 million, respectively. The estimated tax savings from the two LILO transactions through December31, 2005, in the aggregate, was $137 million. On audit of Con Edisons tax return for 1997, the IRS disallowed the tax losses in connection with the 1997 LILO transaction.
Con Edison believes that its LILOs have been correctly reported. In December 2005, Con Edison paid a $0.3 million income tax deficiency asserted by the IRS for the tax year 1997 with respect to the 1997 LILO transaction. Con Edison intends to commence litigation in 2006 in federal court to obtain a refund of this tax payment.
In July 2005, the FASB issued a proposed FSP No. FAS 13-a, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction. The proposed FSP would require the expected timing of income tax cash flows generated by Con Edisons LILO transactions to be reviewed at least annually. If the expected timing of the cash flows is revised, the rate of return and the allocation of income would be recalculated from the inception of the LILO transactions, the company could be required to recalculate the accounting effect of the LILO transactions, which could result in a charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.
Note L  Goodwill and Intangible Assets In 2005 and 2004, Con Edison completed impairment tests for its goodwill of $406 million related to the O&R merger, and determined that it was not impaired. For the impairment test, $245 million and $161 million of the goodwill were allocated to Con Edison of New York and O&R, respectively.
98 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Con Edisons intangible assets consist of the following: December31, 2005 December31, 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Power purchase agreement of an unregulated subsidiary $ 112 $23 $ 89 $ 112 $13 $ 99 Other 2 1 1 2 1 1 Total $ 114 $24 $ 90 $ 114 $14 $ 100 In 2003, upon implementation of new FASB guidance on derivatives (Derivatives Implementation Group Issue C20), the power purchase agreement was measured at its fair value of $112 million and is currently being amortized over its remaining useful life. Con Edison also recognized at fair value certain power sales contracts at Con Edison Development. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an increase to net income of $8 million. The amortization expense was $10 million and $11 million for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is expected to be $10 million annually for the years 2006 through 2010.

The Companies used the simplified service cost method (SSCM) to determine the extent to which these costs could be deducted in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and as a result reduced their current tax expense, by $289 million, of which $264 million is attributable to Con Edison of New York. Under Revenue Ruling 2005-53, the Companies may be required to repay, with interest, a portion of their past SSCM tax benefits and to capitalize and depreciate over a period of years costs they previously deducted under SSCM. The interest could range from zero to approximately $42 million. Repayment of the SSCM tax benefits would not otherwise affect the Utilities results of operations because deferred taxes have been previously provided for the related temporary differences between the SSCM deductions taken for federal income tax purposes and the corresponding amounts charged to expense for financial reporting purposes.
Note N  Stock-Based Compensation The Companies provide stock-based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and contributions to a stock purchase plan.
Stock Options The Stock Option Plan (the 1996 Plan) provided for awards of stock options to officers and employees for up to 10million shares of the common stock.
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) among other things, provides for awards of restricted stock units to officers, stock options to employees and deferred stock units to Con Edisons non-officer directors for up to 10million shares of common stock (of which not more than four million shares may be restricted stock or stock units).
Stock options generally vest over a three-year period and have a term of ten years. Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a common share when the option was 100 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued granted. Upon exercise of a stock option, the option holder may receive Con Edison common shares, cash, or a combination of both.
See Stock-Based Compensation in Note A for an illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Companies had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to their stock-based employee compensation. The weighted average fair values of options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 are $4.51, $5.12 and $4.30 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2005 2004 2003 Risk-free interest rate 3.95% 3.47% 3.35% Expected life 4.6years 6years 6years Expected stock volatility 19.00% 20.63% 21.44% Expected dividend yield 5.37% 5.16% 5.66% A summary of changes in the status of stock options awarded as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows: Con Edison Con Edison of New York Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at 12/31/02 6,797,651 $ 39.506 6,166,151 $ 39.532 Granted 1,621,700 39.639 1,346,700 39.704 Exercised (692,175 ) 32.728 (660,425 ) 32.705 Forfeited (110,000 ) 45.365 (99,000 ) 45.764 Outstanding at 12/31/03 7,617,176 40.065 6,753,426 40.142 Granted 1,333,400 43.771 1,073,700 43.765 Exercised (943,142 ) 34.005 (880,175 ) 33.971 Forfeited (198,250 ) 45.092 (187,700 ) 45.154 Outstanding at 12/31/04 7,809,184 41.302 6,759,251 41.381 Granted 1,300,950 42.723 1,037,750 42.713 Exercised (1,149,533 ) 38.529 (1,023,650 ) 38.457 Forfeited (93,450 ) 43.943 (75,950 ) 44.668 Outstanding at 12/31/05 7,867,151 $ 41.913 6,697,401 $ 42.000 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding at December31, 2005 for each plan year for the Companies: Con Edison Con Edison of New York Plan Year Remaining Contractual Life Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Exercisable 2005 9 1,294,150 $ 42.726 - 1,034,250 $ 42.715 - 2004 8 1,299,050 43.768 - 1,050,700 43.765 - 2003 7 1,593,700 39.648 - 1,326,200 39.709 - 2002 6 1,276,550 42.510 1,276,550 1,099,050 42.510 1,099,050 2001 5 772,550 37.750 772,550 654,550 37.750 654,550 2000 4 249,050 32.500 249,050 199,350 32.500 199,350 1999 3 905,650 47.938 905,650 861,850 47.938 861,850 1998 2 409,050 42.563 409,050 404,050 42.563 404,050 1997/96 1 67,401 30.397 67,401 67,401 30.397 67,401 Total 7,867,151 3,680,251 6,697,401 3,286,251 101 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued The exercise prices of options awarded in 2005 and 2004 range from $42.18 to $43.72 and from $43.06 to $44.10, respectively. Options outstanding awarded in prior years have exercise prices equal to the weighted average exercise prices stated above.
Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit awards under the LTIP have been made as follows: (i)annual awards to officers under restricted stock unit agreements that provide for adjustment of the number of units (as described in the following paragraph); (ii)the directors deferred compensation plan; and (iii)restricted stock unit agreements with three officers. Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof.
The number of units in each annual restricted stock unit award under the LTIP is subject to adjustment as follows: (i)50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on Con Edisons total shareholder return relative to the Standard& Poors Electric Utilities Index during a specified performance period (the TSR portion); and (ii)50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on determinations made in connection with Con Edison of New York's Executive Incentive Plan (or, for four officers, the O&R Annual Team Incentive Plan or goals relating to Con Edisons competitive businesses). Units vest when the performance period ends. In 2005, Con Edison recognized compensation expense of $4 million for the portion of the awards for which the performance period ended December31, 2005.
Con Edison has a deferred stock compensation plan for non-officer directors. Beginning in 2004, awards under the deferred compensation stock plan are covered by the LTIP. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for these units. Each director receives 1,500 stock units for each year of service as a director. These stock units are deferred until the directors termination of service. Directors may elect to receive dividend equivalents earned on stock units in cash payments.
The compensation expense recognized by the Companies in relation to the non-officer director deferred stock compensation plan in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1 million each year.
Pursuant to employment agreements, certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries were granted restricted stock units, subject to the officers meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. The units, each of which represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock, vest over various periods through March 2009 or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. The restricted stock units granted in 2004 and 2005 were under the LTIP. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for the units over the vesting period. The following table summarizes restricted stock activity for the three years ended December31, 2005: Shares Shares outstanding at 12/31/02 500,000 Granted - Redeemed (25,000 ) Shares outstanding at 12/31/03 475,000 Granted 30,000 Redeemed (195,000 ) Shares outstanding at 12/31/04 310,000 Granted 22,500 Redeemed (120,000 ) Shares outstanding at 12/31/05 212,500 The following table summarizes the expense recognized in relation to the restricted stock units: (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Compensation expense  restricted stock $ 5 $ 6 $ 5 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 Stock Purchase Plan The Stock Purchase Plan provides for the Companies to contribute $1 for each $9 invested by their directors, officers or employees to purchase Con Edison common stock under the plan. Eligible participants may invest up to $25,000 during any calendar year (subject to an additional limitation for officers and employees of not more than 20% of their pay). Dividends paid on shares held under the plan are reinvested in additional shares unless otherwise directed by the participant.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, 590,413, 605,118 and 584,928 shares were purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted average price of $45.05, $41.67 and $40.56 per share, respectively.
Adoption of SFAS 123(R) In January 2006, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.123(R), Share-Based Payment. This Statement requires that the Companies recognize the cost of a transaction where it exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services as an expense on its income statement using a fair-value measurement method. SFAS No.123(R) provides for two alternative methods of adoption, the modified prospective application and the modified retrospective 102 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued application. The modified prospective application applies to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the Statements effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding after the Statements effective date will be recognized as the service is rendered on or after the effective date. Alternatively, the modified retrospective application may be applied either to all prior years for which SFAS No.123 was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption. The company has elected the modified prospective application method for adopting SFAS No. 123(R). The fair value of stock options, which contain an employee service condition, will be determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the TSR portion of performance-based restricted stock units, will be valued on the grant date using a model that accommodates the plans market-based conditions, with changes in fair value recorded in net income each reporting period. The fair value of all other restricted stock units will be based upon the closing market price on the grant date with changes in fair value recorded in earnings each reporting period. Con Edison will also adopt a non-substantive vesting period approach to record compensation expense related to retirement eligible employees. See Note A. The company elected to apply the provisions of FSP 123(R)-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, to determine the pool of tax benefits as of the adoption date of SFAS No.123(R). Beginning with adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Companies are computing diluted EPS using the treasury stock method, which considers unrecognized compensation cost as well as the potential tax benefits or shortfalls that reflect the current market price and total compensation cost to be recognized.
In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP 123(R)-2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No.123(R). This FSP allows companies to use the date the awards are approved as grant date in calculating the fair value as long as the awards are non-negotiable and the key terms and conditions are communicated to employees within a relatively short period of time. The Companies will use the date the awards are approved as the grant date because both conditions are satisfied.
The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.123(R) to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Note O  Financial Information By Business Segment The business segments of each of the Companies were determined based on managements reporting and decision-making requirements in accordance with SFAS No.131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, O&Rs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. O&Rs principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility activities.
All revenues of these business segments, excluding revenues earned by Con Edison Development on certain energy infrastructure projects, which are deemed to be immaterial, are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments, excluding certain investments in energy infrastructure projects by Con Edison Development ($234 million at December31, 2005), are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A.
Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.

104 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Note P  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No.133). Under SFAS No.133, derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard. Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value under SFAS No.133.
Energy Price Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas, and steam by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. The fair values of these hedges at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Con Edison ConEdison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Fair value of net assets $ 280 $ 49 $ 223 $ 9 Credit Exposure The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements.
Con Edison and Con Edison of New York had $430 million and $204 million credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2005, respectively. Of these amounts, $308 million and $107 million was with investment-grade counterparties and $108 million and $97 million was primarily with the New York Mercantile Exchange, respectively.
Cash Flow Hedges Con Edisons subsidiaries designate a portion of derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133. Under cash flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be effective, the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective is recognized in earnings in the period in which such determination is made.
The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in accumulated OCI at December31, 2005: Maximum Term AccumulatedOther Comprehensive Income/(Loss) NetofTax PortionExpected tobe Reclassified toEarnings during theNext12Months (Term in Months/ Millions of Dollars) Con Edison Con Edison ofNew York Con Edison Con Edison ofNew York Con Edison Con Edison of New York Energy Price Hedges 41 15 $ (12 ) $ 1 $ (13 ) $ - The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices. The effect of reclassification from accumulated OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transaction in earnings.
The unrealized net gains and losses relating to the hedge ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that were recognized in net earnings for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were immaterial to the results of operations of the Companies for those periods.
Other Derivatives The Companies enter into certain derivative instruments that do not qualify or are not designated as hedges under SFAS No.133. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses record unrealized gains and losses on these derivative contracts in earnings in the reporting period in which they occur. For the year ended December31, 2005, unrealized pre-tax losses amounting to $4 million were recorded in earnings as compared with $5 million of unrealized pre-tax gains for 2004 and $1 million of unrealized pre-tax losses for 2003.
Interest Rate Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The fair values of these interest rate swaps at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Con Edison Con Edison ofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Fair value of interest rate swaps $ (18 ) $ (19 ) $ (3 ) $ 1 105 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued Fair Value Hedges Con Edison of New Yorks swap (related to its $225 million of Series 2001A tax-exempt debt) is designated as a fair value hedge, which qualifies for short-cut hedge accounting under SFAS No.133. Under this method, changes in fair value of the swap are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings.
Cash Flow Hedges Con Edison Developments and O&Rs swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No.133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges are as follows: Debt Maturity Date Notional Amount (Millionsof Dollars) Fixed Rate Paid Variable Rate Received O&R Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bond, 1994 Series A 2014 $ 55 6.09% Current bond rate Con Edison Development Amortizing variable rate loans  Lakewood 2008 $ 44 6.68% LIBOR In late 2004 and early 2005, Con Edison of New York entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest payments associated with the anticipated issuance of $300 million of its debentures later in 2005. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of each hedge, the company locked in a swap rate that had a high correlation with the companys total borrowing costs. The swap agreements were settled in 2005 at the issuance of the debentures. A net loss of $4 million with respect to the swap agreements was recorded in OCI in 2005, which will be reclassified to interest expense over the term of the related debentures.
The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in the accumulated OCI at December31, 2005: AccumulatedOther Comprehensive Income/(Loss)NetofTax PortionExpectedtobe ReclassifiedtoEarnings duringtheNext12Months (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison ConEdison of New York Con Edison Con Edison of NewYork Interest Rate Swaps $ (11 ) $ (2 ) $ (1 ) $ - The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in interest rates. For the Utilities, these costs are recovered in rates and the reclassification will have no impact on results of operations.
Note Q  Variable Interest Entities FASB Interpretation No.46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, (FIN 46R) addresses the consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE) by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both.
Con Edison enters into arrangements including leases, partnerships and PPAs, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, Con Edison retains or may retain a variable interest in these entities.
VIE assets and obligations included in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 Non-utility plant and other assets $ 338 $ 347 Debt and other liabilities $ 360 $ 363 VIE assets include $338 million and $346 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to a lease arrangement entered into by a Con Edison Development subsidiary in 2000, to finance the construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire (the facility). The debt and other liabilities related to the facility were $359 million and $362 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. At the expiration of the initial lease term in June 2010, the subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the facility for the then outstanding amounts expended by the lessor for the facility. In the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the facility, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value for an amount not to exceed $240 million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the lessor if an event of default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the lessors investment in the facility plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value guarantee. The subsidiarys payment and performance obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison. Upon adoption of FIN 46R in 2003, Con Edison recorded a $5 million after-tax charge 106 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Con Edison has a variable interest in a non-consolidated VIE related to Con Edison Developments sole limited interest in an affordable housing partnership that began in 2000. Con Edison Developments maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE is $6 million at December31, 2005 and 2004. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the debt undertaken by the partnership. See Note I.
Con Edison of New York did not apply FIN 46R to the following five potential VIEs with which it has long-term PPAs: Sithe/Independence Partners, LP, East Coast Power, LLC, Selkirk Cogen Partners, LP, Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, LP, and Indeck Energy Services of Corinth, Inc. In each quarter of 2005, requests were made of the counterparties for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether Con Edison of New York is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. See Note J for information on these PPAs.
Note R  Asset Retirement Obligations Con Edison and Con Edison of New York account for retirement obligations on their assets in accordance with SFAS No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No.143). This accounting standard requires recognition of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. When the liability is initially recorded, asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
The Utilities include in depreciation the estimated removal costs, less salvage, for utility plant assets. In accordance with SFAS No.143, future removal costs that do not represent legal asset retirement obligations are recorded as regulatory liabilities pursuant to SFAS No.71. The related regulatory liabilities recorded for Con Edison and Con Edison of New York were $558 million and $501 million in 2005 and $723 million and $666 million in 2004, respectively.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations  An Interpretation of SFAS No.143, which is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2005. The Interpretation clarifies that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is within the scope of SFAS No.143. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation provides guidance for evaluating whether sufficient information is available to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value.
The Companies identified future asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in their buildings and equipment within the generating stations and substations, and within the steam and gas distribution systems. The Companies also identified asset retirement obligations relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place. The estimates of future liabilities were developed using historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors.
The obligation for the cost of asbestos removal from the Companies generating stations and substation structures was not accrued since the retirement dates cannot be reasonably estimated.
In December 2005, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York recorded liabilities of $94 million and $93 million, respectively, for the fair value of their legal asset retirement obligations. In addition, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, by $18 million and $17 million, respectively, for asset retirement costs. Pursuant to SFAS No.71, Con Edison of New York also recorded a reduction of $76 million to the regulatory liability associated with cost of removal to reflect accumulated depreciation and interest accretion costs for the period between the date the obligations were incurred and the date FIN 47 was implemented by the Companies.
If the standard had been in effect as of December31, 2004, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York would have recorded asset retirement obligations of $94 million and $93 million, respectively.
Note S  Related Party Transactions The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive businesses provide administrative and other services to each other pursuant to cost allocation procedures approved by the PSC. The costs of administrative and other services provided by Con Edison of New York and received by it from Con Edison and its competitive businesses for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: ConEdisonofNewYork (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Cost of services provided $ 64 $ 58 $ 37 Cost of services received $ 48 $ 44 $ 25 In addition, Con Edison of New York sold to O&R $185 million, $142 million and $128 million of natural gas for the years ended 107 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are net of the effect of related hedging transactions.
Con Edison of New York also sold to O&R $16 million of electricity for the year ended December31, 2003. This amount includes the net effect of all electric hedging transactions executed by Con Edison of New York on behalf of O&R. In 2005 and 2004, such sales resulted in a net credit of $3 million and $2 million to O&R, reflecting hedging gains.
As a result of an auction held in October 2005, Con Edison of New York entered into financial contracts with Con Edison Energy to hedge purchases of electricity in 2006. In accordance with SFAS No.133, these intercompany contracts are recognized on Con Edison of New Yorks balance sheet at fair value. At December31, 2005, Con Edison of New York recorded an unrealized loss of $9 million as a regulatory asset for such contracts. See Note P.
In December 2005, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to O&R, for periods of not more than 12 months, in amounts not to exceed $200 million outstanding at any time, at prevailing market rates. O&R has not borrowed any funds from Con Edison of New York.
Note T  New Financial Accounting Standards In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04-13). The FASB Task Force concluded that inventory purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty should be combined for accounting purposes if they were entered into in contemplation of each other. The Task Force provided indicators to be considered for purposes of determining whether such transactions are entered into in contemplation of each other. The Task Force also provided guidance on the circumstances under which nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value. EITF 04-13 will be effective for reporting periods beginning after March15, 2006, although no final guidance has been provided on its applicability to the purchase and sale of electricity by utilities. The adoption of EITF 04-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In July 2005, the FASB issued Exposure Draft titled Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes (the Exposure Draft). The proposed interpretation would clarify the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Statement No.109. Under the interpretation, an enterprise would not be allowed to recognize, in its financial statements, the benefit of a tax position unless that position will more likely than not be sustained on audit by taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position. The IRS has completed its audits of the Companies tax returns through 1996. The Companies tax returns for subsequent years, which the IRS is reviewing, reflect certain tax positions with which the IRS does not or may not agree, including tax positions with respect to Con Edisons leveraged lease transactions and the deduction of certain construction-related costs. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note K and Timing of Deduction of Construction-Related Costs in Note M. As to Con Edisons other tax positions, the Companies are unable to predict whether the Exposure Draft, if adopted in its present form, would have a material impact on their financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In June 2005, the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) task force of the FASB issued guidance on SFAS No.133 implementation, Issue No. B38, which provides guidance on whether the potential settlement of the debtors obligation to the creditor that would occur upon exercise of a put option or call option embedded in a debt instrument meets the criteria for net settlement. The DIG also issued guidance on SFAS No.133 implementation, Issue No. B39, which clarifies that certain conditions in the evaluation of embedded derivative debt instruments do not apply to an embedded call option if the right to accelerate the settlement of the debt can be exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower). Both these DIG issues are effective in the first fiscal quarter after December15, 2005. The adoption of Issue Nos. B38 and B39 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements (EITF 05-6), which is effective for periods beginning after June30, 2005. EITF 05-6 states that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination and those acquired after the inception of a lease should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the acquisition of the leasehold improvements. The adoption of EITF 05-6 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No.154, Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS No.154), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. This statement replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.20, Accounting Changes (APB 20) and FASB Statement No.3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in 108 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements  Continued accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No.154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The adoption of SFAS No.154 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46R-5, Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation No.46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
This FSP is effective as of April1, 2005. The FSP requires a company to consider whether it holds an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) or potential VIE. An implicit interest involves the absorbing and/or receiving of variability indirectly from the VIE, and may take many different forms such as a lessee under a leasing arrangement or a party to a supply contract, service contract or derivative contract.
The adoption of FSP FIN 46R-5 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets  an amendment of APB Opinion No.29. APB No.29 requires exchanges of nonmonetary assets to be measured on the basis of the fair value of the assets exchanged, with certain exceptions. SFAS No.153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance, that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the future cash flows of the reporting entity. This Statement is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No.153 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.151, Inventory Costs  an amendment of ARB No.43, Chapter 4. This Statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. The Statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No.151 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Note U  Con Edison Communications (CEC) In 2003, Con Edison decided to consider various strategic alternatives for its telecommunications business. Testing of CECs assets for impairment, in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $140 million. In addition, $1 million of pre-tax capitalized interest at Con Edison, related to the investment in CEC, was deemed impaired.
In December 2004, Con Edison signed an agreement to sell CEC to FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc. (FiberNet) for approximately $37 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. In May 2005, Con Edison and FiberNet mutually agreed to terminate their agreement for the sale of CEC.
In December 2005, Con Edison signed an agreement to sell CEC to RCN Corporation (RCN) for approximately $32 million in cash, including the discharge of certain intercompany liabilities, and subject to certain adjustments. The sale is subject to review or approval by the City of New York, the PSC and various federal, state and local regulators. CECs assets held for sale were tested for impairment in December 2005, which resulted in an after-tax impairment charge of $5 million reflected in losses from discontinued operations. Exit costs associated with the disposal activity include one-time termination benefits and other transaction costs of $5 million, of which $3 million has been incurred to date. The company expects to complete the sale in 2006. The sale is not expected to have a material impact on Con Edisons financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Con Edison of New York receives lease payments from CEC for the right to use its electric conduit system in accordance with the tariff approved by PSC. Subsequent to the sale, Con Edison of New York will continue to receive such lease payments from RCN. The continuing cash flows related to the lease payments are not considered significant in relation to the revenues expected to be generated by the CEC business.
In accordance with SFAS No.144, in 2004, CECs assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and effective December1, 2004, CEC ceased recording depreciation expense. CECs total operating revenues were $42 million, $33 million and $19 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December31, 2005, CEC had assets and liabilities of $60 million and $21 million, respectively. CECs losses, net of income taxes, are reported as Discontinued operations on Con Edisons consolidated income statement. Losses for 2003 have been restated to conform to the 2005 and 2004 presentation.
