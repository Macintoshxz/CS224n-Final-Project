6 CON EDISON Corporate Overview Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. (Con Edison of New York) and Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R). Con Edison has no significant business operations other than those of its regulated utility subsidiaries, Con Edison of New York and O&R, and its unregulated subsidiaries.
For information about legal proceedings relating to Con Edison's October1999 agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities, see NoteP to the Con Edison financial statements in Item 8.
Operating Segments Con Edison's principal business segments are the regulated electric, gas and steam businesses of its utility subsidiaries and the unregulated businesses of its other subsidiaries. In 2002, the operating revenues of the regulated electric, gas and steam businesses and the unregulated businesses were 73.7percent, 14.2percent, 4.8percent and 7.3percent, respectively, of Con Edison's operating revenues. For a discussion of operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see "Results of Operations" in Con Edison's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7. For additional segment information see NoteN to the Con Edison financial statements in Item 8 and the discussions of the businesses of Con Edison of New York and O&R below in this Item 1.
Regulation Con Edison's utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including by state utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Con Edison, itself, is not subject to such regulation except to the extent that the rules or orders of these agencies impose restrictions on relationships between Con Edison and its utility subsidiaries.
Con Edison is a "holding company" under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Con Edison is exempt from all provisions of PUHCA, except Section9(a)(2) (which requires SEC approval for a direct or indirect acquisition of 5percent or more of the voting securities of any other electric or gas utility company) on the basis that Con Edison and its utility subsidiaries are organized and carry on their utility businesses substantially in the State of New York and that it does not derive any material part of its income from a public utility company organized outside of the State of New York. This exemption is available even though Con Edison subsidiaries that are neither an "electric utility company" nor a "gas utility company" under PUHCA will engage in interstate activities.
Con Edison has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by legislative and regulatory developments. Con Edison's utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to the company's subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the company and its subsidiaries. See "Regulatory Matters" in the MD&A of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York in Item 7.
7 Competition Legislative and regulatory developments are promoting increased competition in Con Edison's businesses. For information about competition, see "Competition," below in the discussion of Con Edison of New York's business in this Item 1 and "Unregulated Subsidiaries," below.
Unregulated Subsidiaries Con Edison has four unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity, gas and energy-related services to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R; Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the regulated utility subsidiaries. The unregulated subsidiaries accounted for 7.3percent of consolidated operating revenues and 2.9percent of consolidated net income (before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle) in 2002, and 7.0percent of consolidated total assets at December31, 2002.
For additional information about Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries, see "Results of OperationsUnregulated Business" in Con Edison's MD&A in Item 7.
Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edison's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources, Capital Requirements and Financial Market Risks" in Con Edison's MD&A in Item 7. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
State Anti-takeover Law New York State law provides that a "resident domestic corporation," such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation's board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent "fair price" formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.
Employees Con Edison has no employees other than those of Con Edison of New York, O&R and Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries (which at December31, 2002 had 12,917, 1,015 and 361 employees, respectively).
8 CON EDISON OF NEW YORK Corporate Overview Con Edison of New York, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Con Edison of New York provides electric service in all of New York City (except part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than 8million. It also provides gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of Queens and Westchester, and steam service in parts of Manhattan.
Operating Segments Con Edison of New York's principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses. In 2002, electric, gas and steam operating revenues were 79.9percent, 14.5percent and 5.6percent, respectively, of its operating revenues. For a discussion of the company's operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see "Results of Operations" in its MD&A in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see NoteN to the Con Edison of New York's financial statements in Item 8.
Electric Operations There have been and are continuing to be significant changes in Con Edison of New York's electric operations, including the establishment of the company's electric retail access program (under which all of the company's electric customers are able to purchase electricity from other suppliers) and the company's sale of most of its electric generating capacity. See "Regulatory MattersElectric" in the MD&A of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York in Item 7 and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8.
Electric Sales.
Electric operating revenues were $5.8billion in 2002 or 79.9percent of Con Edison of New York's operating revenues. The percentages were 78.2 and 80.8, respectively, in the two preceding years. In 2002, 58.9percent of the electricity delivered by Con Edison of New York in its service areas was sold by Con Edison of New York to its full-service customers, 22.0percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions, an unregulated subsidiary of Con Edison, to the company's customers under its electric retail access program and the balance was delivered to the state and municipal customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and the economic development customers of municipal electric agencies. The company charges for the delivery of electricity sold by other suppliers to customers in its service area.
For additional information about electricity sales, see "Operating Statistics," below, and "Results of OperationElectric" in the MD&As of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York in Item 7.
Electric Peak Load.
The electric peak load in Con Edison of New York's service area occurs during the summer air conditioning season. The 2002 service area peak load, which occurred on July3, was 12,086thousand kilowatts (MW). The 2002 peak load included an estimated 7,874 MW for Con Edison of New York's full-service customers, 2,483 MW for the company's customers participating in its electric retail access program and 1,729 MW for NYPA's customers and municipal electric agency customers. If adjusted to historical design weather conditions, the 2002 peak load, would have been 9 12,400 MW. Con Edison of New York estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2003 service area peak load would be 12,650 MW, including an estimated 8,055 MW for the company's full-service customers, 2,700 for its electric retail access program customers and 1,895 MW for NYPA's customers and municipal electric agency customers. "Design weather" for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak load is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes.
Electric Supply.
Most of the electricity sold by Con Edison of New York to its customers in 2002 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The firm power contracts were with non-utility generators (NUGs) and utilities (including Hydro-Quebec). The company has sold most of its electric generating capacity (see NoteI to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8).
The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers with electric energy purchased under contracts with NUGs or others, generated from its electric generating facilities (which have a capacity of 630 MW) or purchased through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market. For additional information about electric power purchases, see "Electric Power Requirements" in Con Edison's and Con Edison of New York's MD&As in Item 7 and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8.
For information about the company's contracts with NUGs for approximately 3,100 MW of electric generating capacity, see NoteH to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8.
For the period ending March2004, Con Edison of New York has an agreement with Hydro-Quebec (a government-owned Canadian electric utility) to purchase 400 MW of firm capacity during the months of April through October. The amount and price of a "basic amount" of energy the company is entitled to purchase in each year is subject to negotiation with Hydro-Quebec. In accordance with the agreement, the company can also purchase additional energy during the summer, which it would be obligated to return to Hydro-Quebec during the following winter.
For information about the company's remaining electric generating facilities, see Item 2.
The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization which controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State as an integrated system and administers a wholesale market for electricity in New York State. The NYISO, for reliability reasons, requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (either owned or contracted for) in an amount that is 18percent or more above the expected peak load for their customers. In addition, entities that serve customers in New York City must have enough New York City-located capacity to cover 80percent of their New York City customer peak load. Con Edison of New York met these requirements in 2002 with respect to its full-service customers and expects to meet them in 2003.
For additional information about the NYISO, see "Regulatory MattersElectric" in Con Edison's and Con Edison of New York's MD&A in Item 7.
10 Gas Operations There have been and are continuing to be significant changes in Con Edison of New York's gas operations in recent years, including the establishment of the company's gas retail access program under which all of the company's gas customers are able to purchase gas from other suppliers, which Con Edison of New York would deliver.
Gas Sales.
Gas operating revenues in 2002 were $1.04billion or 14.5percent of Con Edison of New York's operating revenues. The percentages were 15.6 and 13.5, respectively, in the two preceding years. In 2002, 34percent of the gas delivered by the company in its service area was sold by the company to its full-service (firm and interruptible) customers and 66percent was sold by other suppliers, including Con Edison Solutions. For additional information about gas sales, see "Operating Statistics," below, and "Results of OperationsGas" in the MD&As of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York in Item 7.
Gas Requirements.
Firm demand for gas in Con Edison of New York's service area peaks during the winter heating season. The "design criteria" for the company's gas system assumes severe weather conditions, which have not occurred since the 1933-34 winter. Under these criteria, the company estimated that its requirements to deliver gas to firm customers during the November2002/March2003 winter heating season would amount to 77,400thousand dekatherms (mdths) (including 63,600 mdths to its firm sales customers and 13,800 mdths to its firm transportation customers). For the period through January31, 2003, the company's peak day occurred on January7, 2003 when it delivered 1,022 mdths of gas (including 558 mdths to its firm sales customers, 157 mdths to NYPA, 209 mdths to its other transportation customers and 98 mdths for use by the company in generating electricity and steam).
Under its design criteria, the company projects that for the November2003/March2004 winter heating season, its requirements for firm gas customers will amount to 79,300 mdths (including 63,600 mdths to firm sales customers and 15,700 mdths to firm transportation customers) and that the peak day requirements for these customers will amount to 971 mdths. The company expects to be able to meet these requirements.
Gas Supply.
Con Edison of New York has contracts with suppliers for the firm purchase of natural gas. Charges under these contracts, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2006. The company also has contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation and storage services. Charges under these contracts are approved by the FERC. The contracts are for various terms extending to 2013. The company is required to pay certain charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not it actually uses the contracted capacity. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $145million in 2002. See "Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments" in the Con Edison of New York MD&A in Item 7. In addition, Con Edison of New York purchases gas on the spot market and has interruptible gas transportation contracts.
Con Edison of New York recovers its gas supply, transportation and storage costs, less net proceeds of sales of excess capacity (excluding any incentive earned by the company for such sales), from customers 11 pursuant to rate provisions approved by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8.
Steam Operations Steam Sales.
Con Edison of New York sells steam in Manhattan south of 96th Street, mostly to large office buildings, apartment houses and hospitals. In 2002, steam operating revenues were $404.0million or 5.6percent of the company's operating revenues. The percentages were 6.2 and 5.7, respectively, in the two preceding years.
For additional information about Con Edison of New York's steam operations, see "Regulatory MattersSteam" and "Results of OperationsSteam" in the MD&As of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York in Item 7, the discussion of Con Edison of New York's steam facilities in Item 2 and "Operating Statistics," below.
Steam Peak Load and Capacity.
Demand for steam in Con Edison of New York's service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak load during the winter of 2002/2003 (through January31, 2003) occurred on January24, 2003 when the load reached 9.7million pounds per hour. The company's estimate for the winter of 2003/2004 peak demand of its steam customers is 10.8million pounds per hour under design criteria, which assume severe weather.
On December31, 2002, the steam system had the capability of delivering about 12.8million pounds of steam per hour. Con Edison of New York estimates that the system will have the capability to deliver 12.8million pounds of steam per hour in the 2003/2004 winter.
Steam Supply.
Forty-nine percent of the steam sold by Con Edison of New York in 2002 was produced in the company's steam-only generating stations; 38percent was produced in the company's steam/electric generating stations, where it is first used to generate electricity; and 13percent was purchased from others. See Item 2 for a discussion of Con Edison of New York's steam facilities (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Regulation The PSC regulates, among other things, Con Edison of New York's electric, gas and steam rates, the siting of its transmission lines and the issuance of its securities. Certain activities of Con Edison of New York are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. In addition, various matters relating to the construction and operations of Con Edison of New York's facilities are subject to regulation by other governmental agencies. Changes in regulation or legislation applicable to Con Edison of New York could have a material adverse effect on the company. For additional information, including information about the company's electric, gas and steam rates, see "Regulatory Matters" in Con Edison of New York's MD&A in Item 7.
The PSC is conducting a statewide proceeding to consider issues relating to electric and gas utilities' exiting the business of selling commodity (i.e., electric energy and gas, at retail) and related retail services. In particular, the PSC is examining utility "provider of last resort" responsibilities and seeking to identify the consumer protections that will be needed as markets are opened to competition. In March2002, Con 12 Edison of New York filed its cost of service studies for electric and gas service in a separate phase of this proceeding established to address the unbundling of rates into various services (e.g., meter reading, billing services), with a view to having these services provided by competitive markets. A "generic" PSC decision is expected in 2003, followed by a proceeding to apply the generic principles to Con Edison of New York's electric and gas rates. In March2002, the PSC rejected proposals for partial or total disallowance of "stranded costs" resulting from migration of customers to competitive markets and directed the utilities to propose recovery mechanisms, which were filed in May2002. However, there is disagreement regarding which costs would be considered stranded and eligible for recovery. In December2002, the company asked the PSC to terminate or suspend the "unbundling" proceeding on the grounds that the objectives of the proceeding were not being accomplished.
Competition For information about federal and state initiatives promoting the development of competition in the supply of electricity, see "Regulatory Matters" in the MD&As of Con Edison and Con Edison of New York in Item 7. Competition from other suppliers of electricity or gas, suppliers of oil and other sources of energy, including distributed generation (such as fuel cells and micro-turbines) may provide alternatives for Con Edison of New York customers. The company's electric, gas and steam rates are among the highest in the country.
Capital Requirements and Financing For information about Con Edison of New York's capital requirements, financing and securities ratings, see "Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital Resources, Capital Requirements and Financial Market Risks" in Con Edison of New York's MD&A in Item 7.
Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expression of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Environmental Matters General.
Con Edison of New York's capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $69million in 2002 and are estimated to be $66million in 2003.
Superfund.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) by its terms imposes joint and several strict liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for resulting removal and remedial costs and environmental damages. In the course of Con Edison of New York's operations, materials are generated that are deemed to be hazardous substances under Superfund. The materials include asbestos and dielectric fluids containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Other hazardous substances are generated in Con Edison of New York's operations or may be present at company locations. Also, hazardous substances were generated at the manufactured gas plants that the company and its predecessor companies used to operate. See "Superfund" in the discussion of Con Edison of New York's legal proceedings in Item 3 and NoteF to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8.
13 Asbestos.
Asbestos is present in numerous Con Edison of New York facilities and was present in facilities formerly owned by the company. For information about asbestos, see "Asbestos Litigation" in the discussion of the company's legal proceedings in Item 3 and NoteF to the Con Edison and Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8.
Toxic Substances Control Act.
Virtually all electric utilities, including Con Edison of New York, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.
Water Quality.
Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters are along the shoreline of Con Edison of New York's service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that generated hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.

UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES For information about the unregulated subsidiaries' interests in electric generating facilities, see "Electric Power Requirements" in Con Edison's MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). These interests, the capitalized cost of which at December31, 2002 amounted to $526million (net of accumulated depreciation), are included in Con Edison's financial statements as unregulated generating assets and construction work in progress. In addition, Con Edison Development has an operating lease arrangement for a 525 MW generating facility which was placed in service in 2002. See 21 NoteS to the Con Edison financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). The generating facilities, which use primarily natural gas for fuel, are located primarily in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland.
Con Edison Communications' properties, the capitalized cost of which at December31, 2002 amounted to $123million (net of accumulated depreciation), are included in Con Edison's financial statements as non-utility property and construction work in progress. The properties include network facilities and approximately 130 miles of fiber optic cable that has been installed in the New York City metropolitan area primarily through Con Edison of New York underground conduits and other rights of way.

22 ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Con Edison Northeast Utilities For information about legal proceedings relating to Con Edison's October1999 agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities, see NoteP to the Con Edison financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Newington Project For a description of the Newington Project, see NoteS to the Con Edison financial statements included in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference). In September2002, Duke/Fluor Daniel, the general contractor for the Newington Project, initiated an arbitration proceeding with respect to its contract claims for an additional payment to it of $89million for alleged project costs and a 176-day extension of the project's scheduled substantial completion date. In September2002, Con Edison Development commenced an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Hawkeye Funding, Limited Partnership), seeking to adjudicate certain contract disputes with the general contractor. Presently, the arbitration proceeding and Supreme Court action are stayed pending resolution of an appeal in the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division. In September2002, the general contractor commenced an action in Superior Court in the State of New Hampshire, and obtained a pre-judgment attachment on the project as security for the payment of its claim for additional project costs. The New Hampshire Superior Court is presently reviewing a motion to reconsider the propriety of its earlier decision allowing the pre-judgment attachment.
Con Edison of New York Nuclear Generation For information about the PSC proceeding relating to the nuclear generating unit that Con Edison of New York sold in 2001, see NoteG to the Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
In December2002, the United States Supreme Court denied defendants request to review a June2002 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which had unanimously affirmed the October2000 decision by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, in an action entitled Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. v. Pataki, et al. In its decision, the district court determined that the New York State law that directed the PSC to prohibit Con Edison of New York from recovering replacement power costs for the outage from customers was unconstitutional and granted the company's motion for a permanent injunction to prevent its implementation.
Asbestos For information about legal proceedings relating to exposure to asbestos, see NoteF to the Con Edison of New York financial statement in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Superfund The following is a discussion of significant proceedings pending under Superfund or similar statutes involving sites, including manufactured gas sites, for which Con Edison of New York has been asserted 23 to have a liability. See "Environmental MattersSuperfund" in Item 1. Additional such proceedings may arise in the future.
Under Con Edison of New York's current electric, gas and steam rate agreements, site investigation and remediation costs in excess of $5million annually are to be deferred and subsequently reflected in rates.
For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against Con Edison of New York under Superfund, its estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see NoteF to Con Edison of New York's financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
Con Edison of New York and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for manufactured gas at sites in New York City and Westchester County, New York (MGP Sites). Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than Con Edison of New York and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is requiring the company to investigate and, if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the MGP Sites, which include 33 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites.
The information available to Con Edison of New York for most of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods, if any, to be used. Investigation at most of the MGP Sites has not yet started and has been completed at only two of the MGP Sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants have been detected at nine other MGP Sites, including sites in Manhattan and other parts of New York City and in Westchester County.
For additional information about MGP Sites, see NoteF to the Con Edison of New York financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Astoria Site.
Con Edison of New York is permitted by the DEC to operate a PCB storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. The company has submitted to the DEC and the New York State Department of Health a report indicating PCB contamination of a portion of the site. As a condition of its DEC permit, the company is required, where necessary, to conduct a remediation program. The company is investigating the extent of contamination at the Astoria site. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of PCB contamination at the site will be at least $7million.
Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site.
In 1986, the EPA designated Con Edison of New York a potentially responsible party (PRP) under Superfund for the investigation and cleanup of the Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site in Morehead, Kentucky. The site is owned by the State of Kentucky and was operated as a disposal facility for low level radioactive waste from 1963 through 1977 by the Nuclear Engineering Corporation (now known as U.S. Ecology Corporation). In 1995, the United States, the State of Kentucky and various de minimis PRPs, large private party PRPs (including Con Edison of New York) and large federal agency PRPs entered into consent decrees with respect to the funding and 24 implementation of the cleanup program required by EPA for the site. Under the consent decrees, the large private party PRPs are responsible for implementing phase one of the program and any corrective actions required during the first 10years following completion of phase one. The costs of those activities are being shared with the large federal agency PRPs. Also, if during this ten-year period the EPA determines that horizontal flow barriers are required, the large private party PRPs will construct the barriers and share the cost of that work with the large federal agency PRPs and the State of Kentucky. The large private party PRPs are not responsible for any costs after the ten-year period expires. The State of Kentucky will implement and fund the remainder of the cleanup program. Construction work for the phase one program is expected to end this year. Con Edison of New York's share of the cleanup costs is estimated to be between $600,000 and $700,000.
Curcio Scrap Metal Site.
In 1987, the EPA designated Con Edison of New York a Superfund PRP for the Curcio Scrap Metal,Inc. Site in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, because the company had previously sold PCB-contaminated scrap electric transformers to a metal broker who in turn sold them to the owner of the site for salvaging. In 1991, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order which required Con Edison of New York and three other PRPs to implement a soil and sediment cleanup program at and around the site. In 1997, the EPA issued a Record of Decision in which it concluded that the soil and sediment cleanup had successfully remediated the principal threats associated with the site and required periodic groundwater monitoring at the site for five years. Con Edison of New York is conducting the required groundwater monitoring program, which is expected to cost between $500,000 and $600,000 to complete, under an EPA Administrative Consent Order. Depending on the results of the monitoring, the EPA could extend the monitoring program for an additional five years or require remedial measures, such as groundwater treatment or cleanup work.
Metal Bank of America Site.
In 1987, the EPA designated Con Edison of New York a Superfund PRP for the Metal Bank of America Site in Philadelphia. The site, a former metal recycling facility, was placed on the EPA's national priority list in 1983. PCBs have been found in the site soil and groundwater and in the sediment from areas of tidal mudflat and the Delaware River along the site's shoreline. During the 1970's, Con Edison of New York sold approximately 125 transformers to scrap metal dealers who salvaged or may have salvaged the transformers at the site. In 1997, the EPA issued a Record of Decision that calls for, among other things, the removal and disposal of contaminated sediments in the areas of the tidal mudflat and the Delaware River along the site's shoreline. In 1998, the EPA ordered the current and former site owners and operators and various electric utility PRPs, including Con Edison of New York, to design and implement the cleanup program. The cost of the required cleanup program is estimated at between $24million and $30million. Con Edison of New York's share of the costs allocated to the electric utilities is 0.97percent. The utilities are pursuing Superfund cost contribution litigation against current and former site owners and operators.
Narrowsburg Site.
In 1987, the New York State Attorney General notified Con Edison of New York that it is a Superfund PRP for the Cortese Landfill Site in Narrowsburg, New York, because during 1974 the company had disposed of waste oil at the landfill. The Cortese Landfill is listed on the EPA's Superfund National Priorities List. In 1983, the Attorney General commenced an action under Superfund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Cortese 25 Landfill site owner and operator and SCA Services (SCA), the successor in interest of an alleged transporter of hazardous substances to the site. In 1989, SCA commenced a third-part action for contribution against Con Edison of New York and various other parties whose chemical waste was allegedly disposed of at the site. Con Edison of New York and SCA have reached a settlement of the third-party action under which Con Edison of New York paid $114,485 toward the cost of the site environmental studies and will pay six percent of the first $25million of remedial costs for the sites. SCA has agreed to indemnify Con Edison of New York for any other remedial costs and natural resource damages that it has to pay. The EPA has selected a cleanup program for the site that is estimated to cost $12million and the court has approved a consent decree under which SCA, Con Edison of New York and various other site PRPs have agreed to implement the cleanup program, pay the EPA's oversight costs for the site, and pay approximately $220,000 for natural resource damages.
Carlstadt Site.
In 1990, Con Edison of New York was served with a third-party complaint in a Superfund cost contribution action for a former waste solvent and oil recycling facility located in Carlstadt, New Jersey. The complaint in the action, which is pending before the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges that Con Edison of New York is one of several hundred parties who are responsible under Superfund for the study and cleanup of the facility. The plaintiffs in the action, which include a group of former customers of the facility, have completed a $3million remedial investigation and feasibility study for the site. Plaintiffs estimate that seven to 15million gallons of waste solvents and oil were recycled at the site. Based on this estimate, Con Edison of New York's share of the cleanup costs is estimated at about 0.8 to 1.7percent. The costs of the cleanup alternatives that were evaluated in the remedial investigation and feasibility study range from $8million to $321million. Plaintiffs have completed an interim remedy, which plaintiffs claim cost more than $10million, to control releases from the site while the EPA evaluates and develops a final cleanup remedy.
Global Landfill Site.
Con Edison of New York is a PRP under Superfund and the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act) for the Global Landfill Site in Old Bridge, New Jersey. The site, a former sanitary landfill that was authorized to accept municipal refuse and industrial waste, is included on the Superfund National Priorities List and is being administered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) pursuant to an agreement between the EPA and the State of New Jersey. In 1993, a group of site PRPs, including Con Edison of New York, entered into a consent decree with the NJDEP to implement, with partial funding from NJDEP, a Phase I remedy, estimated to cost $30million. In 1997, the EPA issued a Record of Decision in which it selected a Phase II remedy. The site PRP group and the NJDEP are currently negotiating a consent decree under which the site PRP group would also design and implement the Phase II remedy. Con Edison of New York's share of the costs of the Phase I and Phase II remedies is not expected to exceed $150,000.
Chemsol Site.
In 1991, the EPA advised Con Edison of New York that it had documented the release of hazardous substances at the Chemsol Site in Piscataway, New Jersey and that it had reason to believe that the company sent waste materials to the site during the period from 1960 through 1965. In response to the EPA's demand for records relating to Con Edison of New York's dealings with the site and various specified companies, including Cenco Instruments Corporation, the company submitted to 26 the EPA records of payments to Central Scientific Company, a Division of Cenco Instruments Corporation. Con Edison of New York is unable at this time to determine either the purpose of the payments to the Central Scientific Company or the connection of that company to the site. The EPA has not designated Con Edison of New York as a PRP and has not yet selected a final cleanup program for the site. However, the EPA has selected an interim remedy, expected to cost about $8million, for the site groundwater contamination and has ordered several designated PRPs to implement that remedy.
PCB Treatment,Inc. Sites.
In 1994, the EPA designated Con Edison of New York as a Superfund PRP for the PCB Treatment,Inc. (PTI) Sites in Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, because during the mid-1980's it shipped almost 2.9million pounds of PCB-containing oil and electric equipment to two buildings that PTI used at the sites for the storage, processing, and treatment of PCB-containing electric equipment, dielectric oils, and materials. Con Edison of New York is member of a PRP steering committee that, in May2000, completed environmental studies and engineering evaluations for the sites under an EPA administrative consent order. The results of the studies indicate that portions of the buildings' floor slabs, support columns and walls and the soil around the buildings' outdoor loading dock areas are contaminated with PCBs. In August2000, EPA selected a removal action program for the contaminated buildings and soil at the sites. Under the program, which EPA projects will cost $21million to complete, the buildings will be demolished and the contaminated soil will be excavated and shipped to off-site disposal facilities. EPA, the members of the PRP steering committee (including Con Edison of New York) and the federal agencies that shipped PCB-containing waste materials to the sites are entering into an administrative order on consent under which the members of the PRP steering committee will design and implement EPA's removal action program with funding from both EPA and the settling federal agencies. Based on allocation information recently developed by EPA, Con Edison of New York believes that its share of the investigation and remediation costs for the sites could range between $1.5 and $3million.
Borne Chemical Site.
In 1997, Con Edison of New York was named as an additional third-party defendant in a private cost recovery action in the New Jersey Superior Court (Union County) under the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act for the Borne Chemical site in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Borne Chemical used the site for the processing and blending of various types of petroleum, dyes and chemical products from approximately 1917 until 1985 when it became bankrupt and abandoned the site. Between 1971 and 1981, a portion of the site was occupied by a waste transporter and oil spill cleanup contractor that did work for Con Edison of New York at various times. Con Edison of New York and four other third-party defendants in the lawsuit have entered into a settlement with the third-party plaintiffs under which the company paid approximately $70,000 towards the cost of certain work that plaintiffs had already completed and agreed to assume responsibility for approximately 0.67percent of the expenses that the third-party plaintiffs incurred conducting the site investigation study ordered by the NJDEP and any soil or groundwater cleanup program that the NJDEP may require after the site investigation study is completed.
Capasso Site.
In 1997, Con Edison of New York was served with a complaint by DMJ Associates seeking to compel Con Edison of New York and 16 other defendants to clean up contamination at the Capasso property located in Long Island City, New York. The complaint alleges that Con Edison of 27 New York sent waste to the Quanta Resources facility (Quanta) and that contamination, including PCB contamination, has migrated from Quanta to the Capasso property and is contributing to the contamination on or about the Capasso property. Con Edison of New York is continuing to investigate whether it sent any waste to Quanta. Con Edison of New York is defending this action pursuant to a joint defense agreement with the other generator defendants.
Arthur Kill Transformer Site.
Following a September1998 transformer fire at Con Edison of New York's former Arthur Kill generating station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of PCBs was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed DEC-approved cleanup programs for the station's facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July1999 DEC consent order, the company is also carrying out a DEC-approved Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Program to assess the nature and extent of the contamination in, and to recommend a proposed remediation program for the waterfront area of the station. After soliciting public comments, the DEC will select the remedial program to be implemented. In 1999, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of the generating station pursuant to an agreement in which the buyer generally agreed to assume all environmental liabilities relating to the assets sold other than those for prior offsite disposal of hazardous waste and liabilities arising out of the transformer fire. In April2000, Con Edison of New York entered into a Stipulation and Order of Consent with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York pursuant to which the United States Attorney agreed not to prosecute the company in connection with its response to the release of PCBs during the September1998 transformer fire and, among other things, the company agreed to continue to develop, implement and maintain an effective environmental compliance program and to submit the program to an examination and evaluation by a person selected by the United States Attorney.
BCF Oil Refining Site.
In May2000, the EPA designated Con Edison of New York and numerous other parties as PRPs for the BCF oil refining site in Brooklyn, New York. The site was operated as a waste oil reprocessing facility from the late 1970's until August1994, when the facility was forced to close down because its storage and processing tank had become contaminated with elevated concentrations of PCBs. In November1994, the owners of the site sued Con Edison of New York, alleging that its shipments of waste oil and oily wastewater to the facility were the source of the high concentration of PCBs that had contaminated the facility's tanks. The action was dismissed after a jury verdict in Con Edison of New York's favor. However, the facility's tanks still contain significant quantities of PCB-contaminated oil and the EPA has determined that an emergency cleanup program estimated to cost $2.1million is required for them. The EPA is attempting to negotiate with the owners of the facility for the implementation of the required emergency cleanup program, but has indicated that it may order PRPs who shipped waste oil to the facility to implement or to fund the program if the facility owners do not agree to carry out the program.
Mattiace Petrochemical Company Site.
In July2000, Con Edison of New York was served with an EPA Superfund information request for the Mattiace Petrochemical Company Superfund site in Glen Cove, New York. According to the EPA, the Mattiace Petrochemical Company processed, blended, repacked and distributed solvents at the site from the mid-1960's until 1987. Between 1974 and 1982, Mattiace Petrochemical's affiliate, the M&M Drum Company, cleaned and refurbished metal 28 drums at the site. The EPA has reportedly incurred expenses totaling approximately $23.5million since 1988 in conducting emergency removal and cleanup work and other response actions at the site, including the portions of the site used by the M&M Drum Company. During the late 1970's and early 1980's, Con Edison of New York purchased naphtha and a mineral spirit-based solvent product from Mattiace Petrochemical and sold empty scrap drums to Mattiace Petrochemical and M&M Drum. Under a proposed Consent Decree, Con Edison of New York will settle its obligations with respect to this site with a $4.9million payment and TRC Company, an environmental contractor, will be responsible to complete the remediation of the site. In addition, TRC Company is to insure its obligations under the Consent Decree with a $25million insurance policy. If TRC Company were to default on its obligations under the Consent Decree and such default was not covered by the insurance policy, Con Edison of New York could have additional liability with respect to the site.
Croton Point Sanitary Landfill Site.
The New York Attorney General has alleged that Con Edison of New York and numerous other businesses with commercial and industrial facilities within Westchester County, New York are Superfund PRPs for the County of Westchester's Croton Point Sanitary Landfill in Croton on the Hudson, New York, because they formerly used the landfill for the disposal of refuse and waste materials that contained hazardous substances. According to the New York Attorney General, the State of New York has spent over $27million since 1993 assisting the County of Westchester in implementing response actions needed to prevent releases of hazardous substances from the landfill and to properly close the landfill. Con Edison of New York has joined a group of other designated site PRPs that has negotiated a settlement with the Attorney General, under which the settling PRPs will pay $9.5million of the State of New York's past response costs. Con Edison of New York expects that its share of the settlement, which must be approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York before becoming effective, will approximate $370,000.
Washington Heights Power Outage Lawsuits relating to a July1999 interruption of electric service to customers served by Con Edison of New York's Washington Heights distribution network were brought in New York State Supreme and Civil Courts, New York County. A number of cases, including purported class action lawsuits, have been dismissed, discontinued or settled for de minimis amounts. The company does not expect that the remaining cases will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
Ronel Bennett In December1999, Ronel Bennett,Inc. and its president commenced an action in Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Queens, against Con Edison of New York and six of its employees seeking $300million in damages and alleging breach of contract and torts. Ronel Bennett performed work for the company at its former Ravenswood generating station from September1996 to Spring 1997. Plaintiffs claim that the company failed to maintain a safe working environment, misrepresented conditions, failed to disclose information about hazardous and toxic substances, violated federal and New York laws regarding hazardous substances and retaliated against the plaintiffs. The company does not expect this proceeding to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.
29 O&R Asbestos For information about legal proceedings relating to exposure to asbestos, see NoteF to the O&R financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Superfund The following is a discussion of significant proceedings pending under Superfund or similar statutes involving sites, including manufactured gas sites, for which O&R has been asserted to have a liability. Additional such proceedings may arise in the future.
O&R is permitted under its current rate agreements to defer for subsequent recovery through rates certain site investigation and remediation costs.
For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, its estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see "Environmental Matters" in NoteF to the O&R financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Manufactured Gas Sites.
O&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Five of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The DEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites.
O&R has investigated and detected soil and/or groundwater contamination to varying degrees at all of the O&R MGP Sites. However, additional investigation will be required at most of the O&R MGP Sites and the remediation and monitoring methods have not yet been determined.
For additional information about the O&R MGP Sites, see NoteF to the O&R financial statements in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Metal Bank of America Site.
O&R is a PRP with respect to the site described under "Superfund-Metal Bank of America Site" above in the description of Con Edison of New York's legal proceedings in this Item 3. O&R's share of the estimated $24million to $30million cost of the cleanup program is expected to be approximately 4.6percent.
Borne Chemical Site.
O&R is a PRP with respect to the site described under "Superfund-Borne Chemical Site" above in the description of Con Edison of New York's legal proceedings in this Item 3. In October1995, various site PRPs, including O&R, entered into an administrative consent order with the NJDEP which obligates them to perform a remedial investigation to determine what, if any, subsurface remediation is required.
West Nyack Site.
In 1994 and 1997, O&R entered into consent orders with the DEC pursuant to which O&R agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking underground storage tank was found as well. O&R has completed all remediation at the site that the 30 DEC has required to date. The DEC is expected to determine whether any additional groundwater remediation will be required.
Orange County Landfill Site.
In August2000, the New York Attorney General informed O&R that it has been identified as a Superfund PRP for the Orange County Landfill Site in Goshen, New York. The site, a former sanitary landfill, was operated by the Orange County Department of Works between 1974 and January1992 and was reportedly used for the disposal of approximately seven million cubic yards of municipal waste as well as small quantities of waste oil, industrial waste, septic sludge and hazardous waste. In March1992, the DEC designated the landfill site a Class2 Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site after finding groundwater contamination in the vicinity of the site. Since then, the State of New York has incurred expenses totaling more than $12million in connection with various required response actions for the site, including the capping and closure of the landfill. Orange County has reportedly spent an additional $5million in connection with those actions. O&R's records indicate that during the period 1988 through 1990, it disposed of approximately 1.5 cubic yards of oil-soaked debris and four cubic yards of oil and/or solvent-contaminated metal at the landfill. O&R is investigating whether private refuse carters that picked up trash from its facilities may have used the landfill for the disposal of the trash.
Ramapo Landfill Site.
In November2000, the New York Attorney General informed O&R that it was considered a Superfund PRP for the Ramapo Landfill Site in the Town of Ramapo, New York because a commercial carting company that had picked up trash from its facilities in Rockland County, New York during the early 1980's may have disposed of that material at the site. The site, a former municipal waste and construction and demolition debris landfill, is included on the Superfund National Priorities List and is being administered by the DEC. In 1992, the EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting a comprehensive cleanup program for the site, which is estimated will cost between $21million and $28million to complete. The State of New York has reportedly spent more than $19million assisting the Town of Ramapo to implement the required cleanup program.
O&R Clean Air Act Proceeding For information relating to alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act and the New York State Environmental Conservation Law relating to the Lovett Generating Station that it sold in June1999, See NoteF to the O&R financial statements included in Item 8 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).

This discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison) and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Except where noted, this discussion and analysis is presented on a consolidated basis. Information in the notes referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.
CON EDISON Con Edison is a holding company that provides a wide range of energy-related and telecommunications services to its customers through its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Con Edison's core business is energy distribution and it is also pursuing related growth opportunities in competitive businesses.
Con Edison's principal subsidiary is Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. (Con Edison of New York), a regulated utility that provides electric service to over 3.1million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1million customers in New York City and Westchester County. It also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan.
Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R) is also a regulated utility subsidiary of Con Edison. O&R, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Con Edison has four unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity, gas and energy-related services to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R; Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the regulated utility subsidiaries. The unregulated subsidiaries accounted for 7.3percent of consolidated operating revenues and 2.9percent of consolidated net income in 2002 (before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles) and 7.0percent of consolidated total assets at December31, 2002.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SUMMARY Con Edison's earnings per share in 2002 were $3.03 ($3.02 on a diluted basis). Earnings per share in 2001 and 2000 were $3.22 ($3.21 on a diluted basis) and $2.75 ($2.74 on a diluted basis), respectively.
Earnings per share for 2002, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $22.1million after tax, were $3.14 ($3.13 on a diluted basis). See Notes K and O to the financial statements.
36 Earnings for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Con Edison of New York $ 605.4 $ 649.5 $ 570.1 * O&R 44.9 40.2 39.1 Unregulated subsidiaries (2.6 )** 11.5 7.7 Other*** (1.7 ) (19.0 ) (34.1 ) CON EDISON $ 646.0 $ 682.2 $ 582.8 * Includes a pre-tax charge for the possible disallowance of $130million of replacement power expenses.

37 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Con Edison's financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The company's critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utility subsidiaries and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases.
The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the company to use estimates. These estimates may require the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements.
The major critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public UtilitiesSFAS No.71 Con Edison's principal subsidiaries, Con Edison of New York and O&R, are regulated public utilities subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, are subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
Con Edison's principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the company's consolidated balance sheet. The company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The company's regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison provides pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees of its utility subsidiaries and certain employees of its unregulated subsidiaries. Con Edison accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about 38 these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Primarily because of the amortization of previous years' net investment gains, Con Edison's pension expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period (20percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No.87, which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
Con Edison's expense or credit for actual pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the assumptions the company makes for future periods. The company's current estimate for 2003 is a reduction, compared to 2002, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $54million after tax. This reduction reflects, among other factors, an actual loss on the pension fund of 8.6percent in 2002 as compared with an expected annual asset return assumption of 9.2percent. This variation will reduce net income by $21.3million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. In addition, the company has lowered its expected annual asset return assumption for the plans for 2003 to 8.8percent. This revised assumption will reduce net income by $14.5million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002.
Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce the pension and other post retirement benefit net credit by an additional $25million, after tax, in 2004. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2003 as compared to the expected annual asset return of 8.8percent would change net income by approximately $6million in 2004. Under the terms of its current regulatory agreements, O&R would defer as a regulatory asset any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses.
An actuarial valuation of the plan's funded status was performed as of December31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value of the company's pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edison's pension plan assets could fall below the plan's ABO in future years. In that event, Con Edison would be required, under SFAS No.87 and SFAS No.132 "Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, plus its total accrued pension credits, through a non-cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect the company's net income for common stock.
Con Edison was not required to make cash contributions to its pension plan in 2002 nor will it be required to do so in 2003.
39 Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Con Edison's known material contingencies include litigation relating to its October1999 merger agreement with Northeast Utilities, a proceeding relating to outages at the nuclear generating unit the company sold in 2001, workers' compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of the operations of its subsidiaries. See Notes F, G and P to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No.5, the company has accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
Accounting For Derivative Instruments Con Edison's subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase or sale of electricity or gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Financial Market Risks" below and NoteO to the financial statements.
Accounting for Goodwill Con Edison adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" on January1, 2002. In accordance with this standard, Con Edison ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing remaining goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis. Con Edison completed initial goodwill impairment tests and recorded a loss of $34.1million ($20.2million after tax) as of January1, 2002, relating to certain generation assets owned by an unregulated subsidiary. The unamortized goodwill of $405.8million, relating to the acquisition of O&R, was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired. See NoteK to the financial statements.
In determining whether or not its goodwill is impaired, Con Edison is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the results of the goodwill impairment test. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.
Accounting for Leases Con Edison applies SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases" and other related accounting pronouncements to its leasing transactions. See Notes J and S to the financial statements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Con Edison's liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows and discussed below. As a result of these activities, cash and temporary cash investments (including restricted cash) decreased $226.9million at December31, 2002 compared to December31, 2001.
Cash Flows From Operating Activities Con Edison's cash flows from operating activities reflect principally its energy sales and its cost of operations. The volume of energy sales is dependent on factors external to Con Edison such as weather, economic conditions and technological developments. The prices at which Con Edison's utility subsidiaries provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with rate agreements approved by 40 the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdictionthe New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). See "Regulatory Matters" below. In general, changes in the utility subsidiaries' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect Con Edison's cash flow from operations. Principal non-cash charges include depreciation and deferred taxes. Principal non-cash credits include accrued pension credits. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in Con Edison of New York's pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits" and Notes D and E to the financial statements.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 were $82.6million less than the 2001 period. This decrease is due principally to higher energy costs and sales in December2002 as compared to December2001, resulting in increased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by increased accounts payable balances. The net benefit to cash flow from these activities in 2001 was greater than the benefit in 2002 because high energy costs at year-end 2000 were collected in 2001 and energy purchases at year-end 2001 were lower than the prior year. The change in cash flows also reflect the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds and net cash received related to regulatory liabilities, such as transmission congestion contracts, offset by increased cash expended related to regulatory assets. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2001 increased $245.5million compared with 2000, due principally to lower energy costs which are reflected in decreased customer accounts receivable and recoverable energy costs, offset in part by decreased accounts payable balances. See NoteG to the financial statements.
The following analysis reflects variations in balance sheet accounts, which impact specific line items within the consolidated statement of cash flows. The changes in these balance sheet line items are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations.
Accounts receivablecustomers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts were $96.4million higher at December31, 2002 than at year-end 2001, due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam sales in December2002 as compared to December2001. Con Edison of New York's equivalent number of days of revenue outstanding (ENDRO) of customer accounts receivable was 29.3days at December31, 2002, compared with 29.6days at December31, 2001. For O&R, the ENDRO was 23.0days at December31, 2002, compared with 23.6days at year-end 2001.
Recoverable energy costs increased $113.0million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001 due primarily to increased fuel, purchased power and gas costs, resulting from higher sales volumes in December2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Other receivables increased $70.0million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001, due primarily to increased receivables associated with electric and gas commodity transactions at the unregulated subsidiaries (accounts payable for such transactions also increased) and increased gas hedging 41 program receivables at the utility subsidiaries. See "Financial Market RisksCommodity Price Risks," below.
Gas in storage decreased $31.0million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001, reflecting primarily the lower volumes in storage as a result of higher withdrawals due to the colder weather at year-end 2002 as compared to 2001.
Other current assets increased $18.9million at December31, 2002 compared with year-end 2001, due primarily to an increase in the value of energy marketing contracts at the regulated and unregulated subsidiaries.
Deferred loss on the sale of the nuclear generating unit decreased $47.6million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 reflecting the recovery of these costs from Con Edison of New York's customers in accordance with the company's 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Divestiturecapacity replacement reconciliation balance decreased $30.0million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 representing the amortization of capacity costs incurred prior to the opening of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) market, in accordance with the company's 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Deferred environmental remediation costs increased $20.5million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 representing primarily additional liabilities accrued for costs related to Superfund and other sites, which Con Edison's regulated subsidiaries are permitted to recover under current rate agreements. See NoteF to the financial statements.
For information about the regulatory asset for World Trade Center restoration costs, see NoteQ to the financial statements.
Deferred asbestos-related costs increased $33.7million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 due to increased liabilities accrued for Con Edison of New York's non-employee related asbestos claims (which Con Edison of New York is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements). See NoteF to the financial statements.
Other regulatory assets increased $34.4million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 due principally to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization. See NoteA to the financial statements and "Other Regulatory Liabilities," below.
Accumulated provision for injuries and damages increased $21.8million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001, reflecting primarily workers' compensation claims relating to asbestos exposure. See NoteF to the financial statements.
Accounts payable increased $239.7million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam energy costs at December31, 2002 as compared to December31, 2001, reflecting higher sales volumes, and an increase in payables associated with settled 42 electric and gas commodity transactions at the unregulated subsidiaries. See discussion of electric power costs in "Results of Operations," below.
Accrued taxes decreased $45.3million at December31, 2002 compared with year-end 2001, due primarily to the payment of the 2001 fourth quarter federal income tax liability in January2002. The federal government delayed the timing of the payment in light of the World Trade Center attack.
Transmission congestion contracts increased $119.9million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 reflecting proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on Con Edison of New York's transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit.
The gas rate plan balance of $36.3million at December31, 2002 was established in accordance with the 2002 gas rate agreement to provide for the recovery of costs (net of reimbursement) related to the World Trade Center attack.
Electric excess earnings balance of $40.0million at December31, 2002 represents a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with Con Edison of New York's 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
During 2002, other regulatory liabilities increased $125.5million, due primarily to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization and the establishment of a liability to customers for interest earned on a federal income tax refund. Changes in the New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies, effective January1, 2000, repealed or reduced certain revenue-based taxes and instituted a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to these tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and tax expense resulting from tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated into base rates.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were $686.8million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, net of contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust, in the 2001 period. See "Generation Divestiture," below. In addition, construction expenditures increased $112.3million in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the company's electric distribution systems, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at Con Edison of New York's East River steam-electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project). Cash flows used in investing activities in 2001 decreased $605.5million compared with 2000, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, which offset increased utility construction expenditures related to meet load growth on the company's electric distribution systems. See "Generation Divestiture" and "Capital Expenditures" below.
Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine-acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134.4million at December31, 2002, compared to $105.4million at December31, 2001. In 2000, Con Edison of New York agreed to sell this site for an 43 expected price of $576million to $680million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50million in 2000 as a down payment, which Con Edison of New York used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability.
Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 decreased $278.0million compared with 2001, reflecting principally increased financing for construction expenditures at Con Edison of New York, the issuance of common stock and a reduction in the amount of common stock dividends paid in cash. In 2002, the company began issuing new common shares for its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Payment Plan instead of purchasing previously issued shares on the open market (approximately 1.0million shares for $39.6million).
In September2001, the company used the proceeds from the sale of Con Edison of New York's nuclear plant to repay all outstanding short-term borrowing. Net repayments of short-term debt increased $221.8million for the year-ended December31, 2002 compared with 2001 period. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 increased $196.3million compared with 2000, as a result of decreased borrowings and increased debt redemption.
Con Edison had $161.7million of commercial paper and other short-term notes outstanding at December31, 2002 and $343.7million outstanding at December31, 2001. Con Edison's average daily short-term borrowing outstanding in 2002 was $256.1million compared with $241.8million in 2001. The weighted average interest rate was 1.7percent in 2002 compared to 4.6percent in 2001. For additional information about Con Edison's short-term borrowing, see NoteC to the financial statements.
In February2002, Con Edison of New York redeemed at maturity $150million of 6.625percent 9-year, Series1993C Debentures. In April2002, Con Edison issued $325million of 7.25percent long-term debt (Public Income Notes, Series2002A), with a 40-year maturity, callable at par after five years. In June2002, Con Edison of New York redeemed at maturity $150million of variable rate 5-year, Series1997A Debentures and issued $300million of non-callable 5.625percent 10-year Series2002A Debentures. In August2002, Con Edison of New York redeemed at maturity $37.1million of Cumulative Preferred Stock, $100 par value, 6.125percent, SeriesJ. In December2002, Con Edison of New York issued $500million 4.875percent 10-year Series2002B Debentures. In January2003, Con Edison of New York redeemed $275million of 7.75percent 35-year, Series1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures.
In October2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6million aggregate principal amount of its tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10-year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.70percent annual interest rate. In addition, Con Edison of New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with these bonds pursuant to which the company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375percent. See NoteO to the financial statements.
44 External borrowings are a source of liquidity for Con Edison that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about Con Edison's ratings and certain financial ratios, see "Capital Resources" below.
Generation Divestiture In 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its interest in the jointly owned Roseton generating station and its nuclear generating unit and related assets. See NoteI to the financial statements.
Capital Resources Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily from dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and through the sale of securities, including commercial paper. In addition, Con Edison's ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is dependent upon its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by Con Edison's utility subsidiaries, see NoteB to the financial statements.
For information about Con Edison's $950million commercial paper programs and revolving credit agreements with banks, see NoteC to the financial statements.
In 2002, Con Edison issued 1.7million shares of previously unissued shares of its common stock for its Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Payment Plan, Stock Purchase Plan and Stock Option Plan, which increased common equity by $68.5million.
Con Edison expects its utility subsidiaries to finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings.
In December2001, the PSC authorized Con Edison's utility subsidiaries to issue up to $1.95billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which Con Edison of New York issued $525million of debt securities in 2002. In addition, the PSC authorized the refunding of the utility subsidiaries' outstanding debt securities and preferred stock.
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions from Con Edison, internally generated funds and external borrowings and off-balance sheet financings guaranteed by Con Edison. See NoteS to the financial statements.
In August2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds for which the company is eligible to apply for the recovery of costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. See NoteQ to the financial statements.
Con Edison's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and common equity ratio at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were: 2002 2001 2000 Earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) 3.25 3.49 3.10 Common equity ratio 48.2 49.6 49.1 45 Con Edison's ratio of earnings to fixed charges decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of decreased earnings, including a non-cash, after-tax charge of $22.1million related to changes in accounting principles. Excluding this charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002 would have been 3.3. See Notes K and O to the financial statements. Con Edison's ratio of earnings to fixed charges increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased earnings, reflecting charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0million) and merger related expenses ($32.1million). See Notes G and P to the financial statements.
The commercial paper of Con Edison and its utility subsidiaries is rated P-1, A-1 and F-1, respectively, by Moody's Investors Service,Inc. (Moody's), Standard& Poor's Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Con Edison's unsecured debt is rated A2, A and A-, respectively, by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The senior unsecured debt of Con Edison's subsidiaries, Con Edison of New York and O&R, is rated A1, A+ and A+, respectively, by Moody's, S&P and Fitch.
Capital Requirements The following table compares Con Edison's capital requirements relating to its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries for the years 2000 through 2002 and estimated amounts for 2003 and 2004: 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Regulated utility construction expenditures $ 959 $ 1,043 $ 1,157 $ 1,179 $ 1,104 Investment in unregulated subsidiaries 121 187 277 134 47 Sub-total 1,080 1,230 1,434 1,313 1,151 Retirement of long-term securities at maturity 395 638 348 460 * 150 Total $ 1,475 $ 1,868 $ 1,782 $ 1,773 $ 1,301 * Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275million of Con Edison of New York's Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series1996A in January2003.
The increased regulated utility construction expenditures in 2002 and 2003 reflect expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack, programs to meet increased electric load growth and reliability needs, a higher level of gas infrastructure expenditures and the East River Repowering Project.
The investment in unregulated subsidiaries reflects Con Edison's funding to the unregulated subsidiaries as well as the subsidiaries' own investments, but does not include off-balance sheet financing (which is guaranteed by Con Edison). See Notes R and S to the financial statements. At December31, 2002 and 2001, Con Edison's investment in these subsidiaries, on an unconsolidated basis, was $789.8million and $473.5million, respectively.
46 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes Con Edison's material obligations at December31, 2002, to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long-term debt and capital lease obligations are included on Con Edison's balance sheet. Operating leases and non-utility generator (NUGs) contracts (for which undiscounted future annual payments are shown) are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long-term debt (Note B) $ 6,668 $ 473 $ 627 $ 385 $ 5,183 Capital lease obligations (Note J) 72 8 15 14 35 Operating leases (Notes J and S) 418 79 129 88 122 Non-utility generator contracts (Note H) 8,145 543 1,076 1,061 5,465 Natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts 424 144 135 120 25 Total $ 15,727 $ 1,247 $ 1,982 $ 1,668 $ 10,830 Con Edison's material commercial commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments are its guarantees of certain obligations of its subsidiaries. See Notes R and S to the financial statements.
ELECTRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS In 2002, Con Edison's utility subsidiaries purchased substantially all of the energy they sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others or through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market. Con Edison expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2003.
In general, Con Edison's utility subsidiaries recover prudently incurred purchase power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See "Financial Market Risks-Commodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on Con Edison's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, Con Edison's utility subsidiaries have firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and have entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases, which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in the summer of 2003. See Notes H and O to the financial statements. Con Edison of New York also owns approximately 630 MW of electric generating stations located in New York City, the electricity from which it sells through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.
In December2002, Con Edison of New York issued a request for proposals seeking a contract to purchase, for no more than 10years, 500 MW of electric capacity from a new facility located in New York City (or outside the City if there is dedicated new transmission).
47 The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. Con Edison's utility subsidiaries do not expect to add any other long-term electric generation resources. In a July1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that Con Edison of New York need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt Con Edison of New York's request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. Con Edison of New York monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO.
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries sell electricity in the wholesale and retail NYISO and other markets. At December31, 2002, Con Edison Development owned interests in electric generating facilities with an aggregate capacity of 588 MW and had under construction additional generating facilities with an aggregate capacity of 665 MW of capacity. In addition, Con Edison Development has an operating lease arrangement for a 525 MW generating facility (see Notes J and S)that was placed in service in December2002. Con Edison Energy sells the electricity from these generating facilities under contract or on the wholesale electricity markets. See "Financial Market Risks-Commodity Price Risk," below.
REGULATORY MATTERS Electric In July2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. The SMD proposes that transmission owners would join Independent Transmission Providers, or ITPs, which would be independent of market participants, would have operational authority for all transmission assets under their control, and would perform certain functions related to day-ahead and real-time energy markets, determine resource adequacy requirements, financial congestion management, regional planning, market monitoring, and interregional coordination with neighboring ITPs. Transmission facilities of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries, other than those located underground, are currently controlled by the NYISO.
In September1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129million in 1998, $80million in 1999, $103million in 2000 and $209million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to be served by competitive energy suppliers.
48 In November2000, the PSC approved an October2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture-related issues.
The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five-year period ending March2005. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
For additional information about the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
O&R has entered into settlement agreements or similar arrangements with the PSC, NJBPU and PPUC that provide for a transition to a competitive electric market. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
In August2002, O&R's New Jersey utility subsidiary submitted a petition to the NJBPU requesting recovery under New Jersey's 1999 Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA) of $110million of electric purchased power costs in excess of amounts previously billed to customers, associated interest, and other deferred charges. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Gas In April2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces retail sales and transportation rates by $25million, on an annual basis.
In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000.
In November2000, the PSC also approved a gas rate agreement between O&R, PSC Staff and certain other parties covering the three-year period November2000 through October2003.
In November2002, O&R filed a request with the PSC for approval of a $27.2million rate increase effective November2003. O&R also submitted a multi-year plan that addresses rates for two additional years, with an increase of $2.5million per year to cover adjustments to infrastructure costs, inflation and property taxes. The Administrative Law Judge is expected to issue a recommended decision in the third quarter 2003.
For additional information about the new gas rate agreements, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
49 Steam In December2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties with respect to the steam rate plan filed by Con Edison in November1999. The agreement provides for a $16.6million steam rate increase, which took effect October2000 and, with limited exceptions, provided for no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004.
For additional information about the agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS Con Edison's primary market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2002, a 10percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $809.8million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1.2million.
In addition, Con Edison and its subsidiaries, from time to time, enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteO to the financial statements.
Commodity Price Risk Con Edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The regulated and unregulated subsidiaries have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See NoteO to the financial statements.
In general, the rates the utility subsidiaries charge customers for electric, gas and steam service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of steam and electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchases and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Con Edison estimates that, as of December31, 2002, a 10percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $7.4million for the derivative instruments used by its regulated utility subsidiaries to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased.
Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, and commodity derivative instruments. Value-at-risk represents the potential change in the fair value of instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence 50 level. The unregulated subsidiaries estimate value-at-risk across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95percent confidence level. Since the value-at-risk calculation involves complex calculation methodologies, estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. The average, high and low values-at-risk for the 12months ended December31, 2002 were $1.4million, $3.0million and $0.6million, respectively.
Credit Risk Con Edison is exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities for its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterparty's nonperformance. Con Edison uses credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements. Con Edison measures credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff.
Con Edison's unregulated energy subsidiaries had $64.8million of credit exposure, net of collateral, at December31, 2002, of which $45.0million was with investment grade counterparties and $14.2million was with the New York Mercantile Exchange or independent system operators.
Investment Risk Con Edison's investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above.
ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Unregulated subsidiaries of Con Edison engage in energy trading activities that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Con Edison Energy markets energy through specialized products and provides wholesale capacity, risk management and load forecasting and scheduling services to wholesale and retail energy providers and asset optimization services for the electric generating plants of Con Edison Development. Con Edison Energy also procures and markets energy for other Con Edison subsidiaries and utilizes commodity contracts such as two-party forward contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity and capacity, over-the counter swap contracts, exchange-traded natural gas and crude oil futures and options, transmission congestion contracts, natural gas transportation contracts and other physical and financial contracts.
Prior to October2002, these contracts were accounted for under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As of October2002, energy and energy-related trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for under SFAS No.133. Such contracts are marked to market with gains and losses recognized in earnings. For the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, Con Edison recognized in income net unrealized pre-tax losses of $1.4million, excluding the effect of a cumulative adjustment 51 due to a change in accounting principle, and net gains of $9.6million, respectively. Contracts that did not fall within the scope of SFAS No.133 were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in December2002. See NoteT to the financial statements.
The changes in fair value of energy trading net assets for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 (MillionsofDollars) Fair value of net assets outstanding - beginning of period $ 11.2 $ 1.6 Change in fair value during the period: Unrealized gain at inception 10.9 - Net premium paid/(received) (1.7 ) - Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (3.2 ) - Changes in fair value prior to settlement 6.4 (1.6 ) Fair value realized at settlement of contracts (18.7 ) 11.2 Total change in fair value during the period (6.3 ) 9.6 Fair value of net assets outstanding - end of period $ 4.9 $ 11.2 As of December31, 2002, the sources of fair value of the energy trading net assets were as follows: Fair Value of Net Assets at PeriodEnd (Millions of Dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1-3 years Maturity 4-5 years Maturity in excess of 5 years Total fair value Prices provided by external sources $ 12.6 $ (4.8 ) $ - $ - $ 7.8 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (2.9 ) - - - (2.9 ) Total $ 9.7 $ (4.8 ) $ - $ - $ 4.9 "Prices provided by external sources" represents the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
"Prices based on models and other valuation methods" represents the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect management's estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk-free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of energy commodity prices and contractual volumes. Counterparty specific credit quality, market price uncertainty and other risks are also factored into the models.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment, including the Superfund, and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see NoteF to the financial statements.
52 IMPACT OF INFLATION Con Edison is affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits Con Edison's utility subsidiaries to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the utility subsidiaries' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Con Edison's results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of Operations-Summary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. Con Edison's principal business segments are its electric, gas and steam utility businesses of its regulated utility subsidiaries and the businesses of its unregulated subsidiaries. For additional information about its business segments, see NoteN to the financial statements.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2002 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2001 Electric Con Edison's electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $637.0million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $297.1million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43.3million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with Con Edison of New York's 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40.0million), the amortization of the loss ($29.9million) related to the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the company's rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24.0million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Electricity delivery volumes for Con Edison's utility subsidiaries increased 2.0percent in 2002 compared with 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volumes for Con Edison of New York and O&R increased 0.5percent and 3.2percent, respectively, in the 2002 period.
Con Edison's electric purchased power costs decreased $244.8million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries. This decrease was offset in part by Con Edison of New York's increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the company's nuclear generating unit in September2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52.3million as a result of decreased generation at Con Edison of New York's owned power plants. In general, Con Edison's utility subsidiaries recover prudently incurred fuel and 53 purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Con Edison's electric operating income decreased $85.4million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $339.9million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating revenues. The decrease in net revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($135.0million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001, but not in 2002 and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($30.3million) and lower revenue taxes ($27.2million). The decrease is also offset by lower income tax of $63.9million.
Gas Con Edison's gas operating revenues decreased $261.9million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($233.9million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs at Con Edison of New York. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and for Con Edison of New York, revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April2002. Gas operating income decreased $6.5million in 2002, reflecting a $28.0million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($10.0million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16.6million), reduced revenue taxes ($12.1million) and lower income taxes ($7.8million).
Con Edison's gas sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.2percent in the year ended December31, 2002 compared with the year ended December31, 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes for Con Edison of New York and O&R decreased 1.5percent and 0.3percent, respectively, in the 2002 period.
Con Edison's gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather-normalization provision that applies to the gas business of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on gas operating income.
Steam Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues decreased $99.7million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002, and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs. Steam operating income increased $8.2million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9.3million and lower income taxes of $10.5million, offset in part by a 54 decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11.1million. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Steam sales volume decreased 3.2percent in the year ended December31, 2002 compared with the year ended December31, 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales volume decreased 1.4percent.
Unregulated Business Earnings for the unregulated subsidiaries decreased $14.0million in 2002 compared with 2001, reflecting a non-cash, after-tax charge in 2002 of $22.1million for changes in accounting principles (see Notes K, O and S to the financial statements) and continued start-up losses in the company's wholesale telecommunications business, including a non-cash, after-tax charge in 2002 of $5.0million for a write-down of an investment in Neon Communications,Inc. (NEON). The decrease in earnings was offset, in part, by higher electric retail sales volumes and gross margins, the capitalization of previously expensed project development costs on generation assets ($4.2million after tax) and unrealized mark-to-market gains on derivative instruments ($6.9million after tax), which are also discussed below in "Other Income." Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1.1billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison's largest operating expenses.
The principal components of, and variations in, operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 660.6 $ 11.5 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 365.2 (38.1 ) Payroll taxes 60.1 (0.7 ) Other taxes 28.3 2.0 Total $ 1,114.2 * $ (25.3 ) * Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 were $1,463.7million.
Effective in 2003, New York City increased Con Edison of New York's annual property taxes by $96million. Under Con Edison of New York's rate agreements, the company is deferring the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers.
Other Income Investment income decreased $6.1million in 2002 compared to 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short-term cash investments in the 2002 period as compared to the 2001 period. For the 2001 period, the company had more cash on hand than the 2002 period, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $8.7million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other 55 income increased $52.5million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to $26.7million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10.2million write-off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund in 2001, a $9.4million increase in interest earned on Con Edison of New York's regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities-SFAS No.71," above) and a $11.7million mark-to-market gain on derivative contracts for an unregulated subsidiary. These increases were offset in part by reduced income of $2.5million from Con Edison of New York's non-utility operations. Other income deductions decreased $8.1million due principally to lower legal fees relating to the Northeast Utilities litigation. See NoteP to the financial statements.
Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $10.7million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19.1million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long-term debt of $11.6million.
Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $11.8million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue-based taxes and replaced them with the imposition of a net income-based tax. State income taxes decreased $54.4million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over- or under-collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and L to the financial statements.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2001 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2000 Electric Con Edison's electric operating revenues in 2001 decreased $50.3million from 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects decreased purchased power costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements) and electric rate reductions of $375.6million in 2001, offset by the effects of the warmer than normal summer weather when compared to cooler than normal weather for the 2000 period.
Electricity sales volume for Con Edison's utility subsidiaries increased 3.1percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase reflects the warmer than normal summer weather and economic growth. Con Edison's electric sales vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the summer.
After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, electricity sales volume for Con Edison New York increased 2.4percent in 2001 compared with 2000. For O&R, weather-adjusted electric sales increased 3.3percent in 2001 compared with 2000.
Con Edison's electric operating income increased $93.2million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase reflects an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power) of $73million. The increase in net revenues reflects principally increased sales ($76.3million), recognition 56 of revenue related to previously deferred NYPA rate increases ($35.2million), gains on the sale of divested generation plants ($37.5million), increased system benefit charges ($41million), recovery of incremental NUG cost ($31.0million), reconciliation of state income tax and gross receipts tax ($110.8million; see "Income Tax" below) and the reduction in net revenues in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0million), offset by electric rate reductions of $375.6million in 2001. Electric operating income also increased due to decreased other operations and maintenance expenses of $107.9million and decreased depreciation and amortization expense of $69.1million, offset in part by increased property taxes of $33.7million, federal income tax of $42.3million and state income tax of $99.1million (see "Income Tax" below).
The $107.9million decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses reflects principally lower expenses related to Con Edison of New York's nuclear generating unit which was sold in September2001 ($98.4million), increased pension credits ($42.5million) and decreased transmission expenses ($11.3million), offset in part by higher distribution expenses for the relocation of company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($13.4million) and increased system benefit charges ($41million).
Gas Con Edison's gas operating revenues increased $204.0million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting increased cost of purchased gas, offset in part by a reduction in customers' bills of $20.0million, reflecting a refund of previously deferred credits and other provisions of the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in November2000. The increase in operating income of $3.7million reflects principally an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale) of $5.4million, increased pension credits of $8.2million, and the recognition in income in the 2001 period of previously deferred gas credits ($7.0million), offset in part by increased depreciation and amortization expense ($5.3million), increased state income tax ($8.7million; see "Income Tax" below) and higher distribution expenses of $3.0million for the relocation of company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects.
Firm gas sales and transportation volume for Con Edison's utility subsidiaries decreased 2.0percent in 2001 compared with 2000.
Con Edison's gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. The decrease in volume in 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the warmer 2001 winter compared with 2000.
After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers for Con Edison of New York increased 2.8percent in 2001 compared with 2000. For O&R, weather-adjusted gas sales decreased 0.1percent in 2001 compared with 2000.
Steam Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues increased $51.6million in 2001 compared to 2000, reflecting primarily increased purchased steam and fuel costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA 57 to the financial statements). Steam operating income increased $2.3million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting an October2000 rate increase of $16.6million.
Steam sale volume decreased 5.3percent in 2001 compared with 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects the mild winter weather compared with 2000.
After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, steam sales volume decreased 2.7percent in 2001.
Unregulated Business Operating revenues of Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries decreased $133.7million in 2001 compared to 2000, principally reflecting lower gas revenues as result of lower gas sales volumes in the 2001 period compared to 2000. The decrease in operating revenues was offset by a comparable decrease in the cost of gas purchased and other expenses.
The unregulated subsidiaries' operating income increased $11.6million in 2001 compared to 2000 due principally to higher electric commodity gross margins and higher wholesale energy trading volumes.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of, and variations, in operating taxes were: 2001 Amount Increase/(Decrease) 2001 compared to 2000 (MillionsofDollars) Property taxes $ 649.1 $ 35.1 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 403.3 (22.2 ) Payroll taxes 60.8 1.4 Other taxes 26.3 3.4 Total $ 1,139.5 * $ 17.7 * Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2001 were $1,520.3million.
Other Income Other income increased $11.4million in 2001 compared with 2000, due principally to reduced federal income tax expense and the recognition in 2000 of $32.1million of merger-related expenses, offset by the write-off in 2001 of an investment of $10.2million in the New York City Discovery Fund.
Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $23.4million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting $28.4million of increased interest expense for Con Edison of New York related to long-term borrowings and $5.7million of interest expense related to long-term borrowing for a 236 MW electric generating facility located in Lakewood, New Jersey (which was purchased in June2000 by an unregulated subsidiary), offset in part by $10.6million in 2000 for interest accrued on the net after-tax gain from Con Edison of New York's 1999 generation divestiture, prior to the disposition of this gain in 2000. See NoteI to the financial statements.
58 Income Tax Federal income tax increased $14.9million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting the changes in income before tax, deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. State income taxes increased $120.6million in 2001 compared with 2000 as a result of the change in New York State tax law, offset by a corresponding increase in other operating revenues for taxes no longer applicable but still being recovered through rates. See NotesA and L to the financial statements.
59 ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK,INC.
This discussion and analysis relates to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. (Con Edison of New York or the Company) and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. Information in the notes referred to in this discussion and analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.
CON EDISON OF NEW YORK'S BUSINESS Con Edison of New York is a regulated utility that provides electric service to over 3.1million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1million customers in New York City and Westchester County. It also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. All of the common stock of Con Edison of New York is owned by Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison).
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SUMMARY Con Edison of New York's net income for common stock for the year ended December31, 2002 was $605.4million. Earnings for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000 were $649.5million and $570.1million, respectively.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Con Edison of New York's financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies.
The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the Company to use estimates. These estimates require the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements.
The major critical accounting policies are as follows: Accounting for Regulated Public UtilitiesSFAS No.71 Con Edison of New York is a regulated public utility subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, is subject to the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC).
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
Con Edison of New York's principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Company's regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the PSC.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison of New York provides pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation, health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000.
61 Primarily because of the amortization of previous years' net investment gains, Con Edison of New York's pension expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was negative, resulting in a credit to and increase in net income in each year. Investment gains and losses on plan assets are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period (20percent of the gains and losses for each year begin to amortize in each of the following five years and the amortization period for each 20percent portion of the gains and losses is ten years). This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No.87, which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
Con Edison of New York's expense or credit for actual pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the assumptions the Company makes for future periods. The Company's current estimate for 2003 is a reduction, compared to 2002, in the pension and other postretirement benefits net credit of $54million after tax. This reduction reflects, among other factors, an actual loss on the pension fund of 8.6percent in 2002 as compared with an expected annual asset return assumption of 9.2percent. This variation will reduce net income by $21.3million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002. In addition, the Company has lowered its expected annual asset return assumption for the plans for 2003 to 8.8percent. This revised assumption will reduce net income by $14.5million after tax in 2003, as compared to 2002.
Amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to reduce the pension and other postretirement benefit net credit by an additional $25million, after tax, in 2004. A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2003 as compared to the expected annual asset return of 8.8percent would change net income by approximately $6million in 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the plan's funded status (which applies to both Con Edison of New York and O&R) was performed as of December31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value of the pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edison's pension plan assets could fall below the plan's ABO in future years. In that event, Con Edison would be required, under SFAS No.87 and SFAS No.132 "Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, plus its total accrued pension credits, through a non-cash charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect the Company's net income for common stock.
Con Edison of New York was not required to make cash contributions to its pension plan in 2002 nor will it be required to do so in 2003.
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's known material contingencies include a PSC 62 proceeding relating to outages at the nuclear generating unit the Company sold in 2001, workers' compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of its operations. See Notes F and G to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No.5, the Company has accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Con Edison of New York's liquidity reflects cash flows from its operating, investing and financing activities as shown on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows and discussed below. As a result of these activities, cash and temporary cash investments (including restricted cash) decreased $176.7million at December31, 2002 compared to December31, 2001.
Cash Flows From Operating Activities Con Edison of New York's cash flows from operating activities reflect principally its energy sales and its cost of operations. The volume of energy sales is dependent on factors external to the Company such as weather, economic conditions and technological developments. The prices at which the Company provides energy to its customers are determined in accordance with rate agreements approved by the PSC. See "Regulatory Matters," below. In general, changes in the cost of purchased power, fuel and gas affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Net income for common stock is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect Con Edison of New York's cash flow from operations. Principal non-cash charges included depreciation and deferred taxes. Principal non-cash credits included accrued pension credits. Pension credits result from past favorable performance in the Company's pension fund and assumptions about future performance. See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above, and Notes D and E to the financial statements.
Net cash flows from operating activities in 2002 were $10.1million more than the 2001 period. The change in cash flows reflect the aforementioned impact of energy sales and its cost of operations, the timing of federal income tax payments and refunds and cash received or expended related to regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively.
The following analysis reflects variations in balance sheet accounts, which also impact specific line items within the consolidated statement of cash flows. The change in these balance sheet line items are utilized to reconcile income to cash flow from operations.
Accounts receivablecustomers, less allowance for uncollectible accounts were $74.7million higher at December31, 2002 than at year-end 2001, due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam sales in December2002 as compared to December2001. The Company's equivalent number of days of revenue outstanding (ENDRO) of customer accounts receivable was 29.3days at December31, 2002, compared with 29.6days at December31, 2001.
63 Recoverable energy costs increased $101.8million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001 due primarily to increased fuel, purchased power and gas costs, resulting from higher sales volumes in December2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Other receivables increased $19.9million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001, due primarily to increased gas hedging program receivables.
Gas in storage decreased $22.5million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001, reflecting primarily the lower volumes in storage as a result of higher withdrawals due to the colder weather at year-end 2002 as compared to 2001.
Other current assets increased $20.8million at December31, 2002 compared with year-end 2001, due primarily to an increase in the value of energy marketing contracts.
Deferred loss on the sale of the nuclear generating unit decreased $47.6million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 reflecting the recovery of these costs from customers in accordance with the Company's 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Divestiturecapacity replacement reconciliation balance decreased $30.0million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 representing the amortization of capacity costs incurred prior to the opening of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) market in accordance with the Company's 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Deferred environmental remediation costs increased $30.3million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 representing primarily additional liabilities accrued for costs related to Superfund and the other sites, which the Company is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements. See NoteF to the financial statements.
For information about the regulatory asset for World Trade Center restoration costs, see NoteP to the financial statements.
Deferred asbestos-related costs increased $33.7million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 due to increased liabilities accrued for non-employee related asbestos claims (which the Company is permitted to recover under its current rate agreements). See NoteF to the financial statements.
Other regulatory assets increased $37.4million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 due principally to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization. See NoteA to the financial statements and "Other Regulatory Liabilities," below.
Accumulated provision for injuries and damages increased $24.5million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001, reflecting primarily workers' compensation claims relating to asbestos exposure. See NoteF to the financial statements.
64 Accounts payable increased $152.0million at December31, 2002 as compared with year-end 2001. This increase is due primarily to higher electric, gas and steam energy costs at December31, 2002 as compared to December31, 2001, reflecting higher sales volumes. See discussion of electric power costs in "Results of Operations," below.
Accrued taxes decreased $48.6million at December31, 2002 compared with year-end 2001, due primarily to the payment of the 2001 fourth quarter federal income tax liability in January2002. The federal government delayed the timing of the payment in light of the World Trade Center attack.
Transmissions congestion contracts increased $119.9million at December31, 2002 as compared to year-end 2001 reflecting proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on Con Edison of New York's transmission system. These proceeds are being retained for customer benefit.
The gas rate plan balance of $36.3million at December31, 2002 was established in accordance with the 2002 gas rate agreement to provide recovery of costs (net of reimbursement) related to the World Trade Center attack.
Electric excess earnings balance of $40.0million at December31, 2002 represents a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
During 2002, other regulatory liabilities increased $127.7million, due primarily to the reconciliation of taxes collected and the tax expense resulting from New York State tax law changes in accordance with PSC authorization and the establishment of a liability to customers for interest earned on a federal income tax refund. Changes in the New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies, effective January1, 2000, repealed or reduced certain revenue-based taxes and instituted a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to these tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and tax expense resulting from tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated into base rates.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities were $710.3million higher in 2002 compared with 2001, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture, net of contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust, in the 2001 period. See "Generation Divestiture," below. In addition, construction expenditures increased $119.6million in 2002 compared with 2001, principally to meet load growth on the Company's electric distribution systems, to effect permanent restoration of portions of the electric, gas and steam systems in lower Manhattan following the World Trade Center attack and for the ongoing project to add incremental generating capacity at the Company's East River steam-electric generating plant (the East River Repowering Project). Cash flows used in investing activities in 2001 decreased $612.7million compared with 2000, due primarily to the receipt of proceeds from generation divestiture in the 2001 period, which offset increased utility construction expenditures ($93.3million) related to meet load growth on the Company's electric distribution systems. See "Generation Divestiture" and "Capital Expenditures" below.
65 Deferred real estate sale costs related to the demolition and remediation of a nine-acre development site in midtown Manhattan along the East River were $134.4million at December31, 2002, compared to $105.4million at December31, 2001. In 2000, the Company agreed to sell this site for an expected price of $576million to $680million, depending on zoning and other adjustments. The sale is subject to PSC approval and other conditions. The buyer paid Con Edison of New York $50million in 2000 as a down payment, which the Company used to fund a portion of the demolition and remediation expenses. The down payment has been recorded as a regulatory liability.
Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities Net cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 decreased $329.1million compared with 2001, reflecting principally increased financing for construction expenditures, and reduced dividend payments to the parent.
In September2001, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of its nuclear plant to repay all outstanding short-term borrowing. Net repayments of short-term debt increased $140.0million for the year-ended December31, 2002 compared with 2001 period. The common stock dividend to parent decreased $79.3million in 2002 compared with 2001. Cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 increased $376.0million compared with 2000, as a result of decreased borrowings and increased debt redemption.
External borrowings are a source of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital markets. For information about the Company's credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see "Capital Resources," below.
Con Edison of New York had no commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2002 and at December31, 2001. The Company's average daily commercial paper outstanding in 2002 was $156.7million compared to $163.8million in 2001. The weighted average interest rate was 1.8percent in 2002 compared to 4.9percent in 2001. For additional information about the Company's commercial paper program, see NoteC to the financial statements.
In February2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $150million of 6.625percent 9-year Series1993C Debentures. In June2002, the Company redeemed at maturity $150million of variable rate 5-year Series1997A Debentures and issued $300million of non-callable 5.625percent 10-year Series2002A Debentures.

In January2003, the Company redeemed $275million of 7.75percent 35-year, Series1996A, Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures.
In October2002, Con Edison of New York changed the interest rate method applicable to $224.6million aggregate principal amount of its tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series2001A from a variable weekly rate mode to a 10-year term mode, callable at par after three years with a 4.70percent annual interest rate. In addition, the Company entered into a swap agreement in connection with these 66 bonds pursuant to which the Company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375percent. See NoteO to the financial statements.
Generation Divestiture In 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its interest in the jointly owned Roseton generating station and its nuclear generating unit and related assets. See NoteI to the financial statements.
Capital Resources Con Edison of New York expects to finance its operations, capital requirements and the payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally generated funds and external borrowings, including commercial paper. For information about Con Edison of New York's commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see NoteC to the financial statements.
In December2001, the PSC authorized Con Edison of New York to issue up to $1.8billion of debt securities prior to 2006, of which the Company issued $525million of debt securities in 2002. The PSC also authorized the refunding of the Company's outstanding debt securities and preferred stock.
In August2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds for which the Company is eligible to apply for the recovery of costs it incurred in connection with the World Trade Center attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. See NoteP to the financial statements.
Con Edison of New York's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and common equity ratio at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were: 2002 2001 2000 Earnings to fixed charges (SEC basis) 3.35 3.66 3.23 Common equity ratio 46.6 47.2 46.4 The changes in interest coverage in these years reflect changes in pre-tax income and changes in interest charges due to debt issuances and refunding. The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of increased earnings, reflecting charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130million). See NoteG to the financial statements.
The commercial paper of Con Edison of New York is rated P-1, A-1 and F-1, respectively, by Moody's Investors Service,Inc. (Moody's), Standard& Poor's Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). The senior unsecured debt of Con Edison of New York is rated A1, A+ and A+, respectively, by Moody's, S&P, and Fitch.
67 Capital Requirements The following table compares Con Edison of New York's capital requirements for the years 2000 through 2002 and estimated amounts for 2003 and 2004: 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Utility construction expenditures $ 908 $ 983 $ 1,098 $ 1,107 $ 1,031 Retirement of long-term securities at maturity 275 628 337 425 * 150 Total $ 1,183 $ 1,611 $ 1,435 $ 1,532 $ 1,181 * Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275million of Con Edison of New York's Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series1996A in January2003.
The increased regulated utility construction expenditures in 2002 and 2003 reflect expenditures for permanent electric, gas and steam system restoration following the World Trade Center attack, programs to meet increased electric load growth and reliability needs, a higher level of gas infrastructure expenditures and the East River Repowering Project.

ELECTRIC POWER REQUIREMENTS In 2002, Con Edison of New York purchased substantially all of the energy it sold to customers pursuant to firm contracts with NUGs and others or through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.
The Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Financial Market RisksCommodity Price Risk" below and "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements. From time to time certain parties have petitioned the PSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Con Edison of New York's financial position, results or operations or liquidity.
68 To reduce the volatility of electric energy costs, the Company has firm contracts to purchase electric energy (including the output of the nuclear generating unit divested in 2001) and has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of expected purchases which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to its customers in the summer of 2003. See Notes H and O to the financial statements. The Company also owns 630 MW of electric generating stations located in New York City, the electricity from which it sells through the NYISO's wholesale electricity market.
In December2002, the Company issued a request for proposals seeking a contract to purchase, for no more than 10years, 500 MW of electric capacity from a new facility located in New York City (or outside the City if there is dedicated new transmission).
The East River Repowering Project will add incremental electric capacity of approximately 200 MW based on a winter nominal rating or approximately 125 MW based on a summer nominal rating. The Company does not expect to add any other long-term electric generation resources. In a July1998 order, the PSC indicated that it "agree(s) generally that the Company need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops," but considers "overly broad" and did not adopt its request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, the Company will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. The Company monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy issues within the framework of the NYISO.
REGULATORY MATTERS Electric In July2002, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to establish a Standard Market Design (SMD) for wholesale electricity markets across the country. The proposed SMD has many of the elements of the markets that have been established in the Northeast, and if adopted, could facilitate transactions among energy markets across the country. The SMD proposes that transmission owners would join Independent Transmission Providers, or ITPs, which would be independent of market participants, would have operational authority for all transmission assets under their control, and would perform certain functions related to day-ahead and real-time energy markets, determine resource adequacy requirements, financial congestion management, regional planning, market monitoring, and interregional coordination with neighboring ITPs. The Company's transmission facilities, other than those located underground, are currently controlled by the NYISO.
In September1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement among Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, the Company reduced electric rates on an annual basis by $129million in 1998, $80million in 1999, $103million in 2000 and $209million in 2001, divested most of its electric generating capacity, and enabled all of its electric customers to choose to be served by competitive energy suppliers.
69 In November2000, the PSC approved an October2000 agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that, among other things, revised and extended the electric rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and addressed certain generation divestiture-related issues.
The electric rate plan provisions of the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement cover the five-year period ending March2005. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which the Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
For additional information about the 1997 Restructuring Agreement and the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Gas In April2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces retail sales and transportation rates by $25million, on an annual basis.
In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000.
For additional information, see "Rate and Restructuring" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Steam In December2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, PSC staff and certain other parties with respect to the steam rate plan filed by the Company in November1999. The agreement provides for a $16.6million steam rate increase, which took effect October2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004.
For additional information about the agreement, see "Rate and Restructuring" in NoteA to the financial statements.
FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS Con Edison of New York's primary financial market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. Con Edison of New York manages interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Company estimates that, as of December31, 2002, a 10percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $615.3million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $1.1million.
70 In addition, the Company, from time to time, enters into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteO to the financial statements.
Commodity Price Risk Con Edison of New York's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity and gas that the Company delivers to its customers. The Company has risk management strategies to mitigate its related exposure and uses derivative instruments to hedge this price risk. See "Energy Price Hedging" in NoteO to the financial statements. Also, see Item 2 of this report for a discussion of the Company's generating capacity .
In general, the rates the Company charges customers for electric, gas and steam service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of steam and electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
The Company estimates that, as of December31, 2002, a 10percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $5.7million for the derivative instruments used by it to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. The Company expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased.
Credit Risk Con Edison of New York is exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterparty's nonperformance. The Company uses credit policies to manage its credit risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements and credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, or prepayment arrangements.
Investment Risk Con Edison of New York's investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," above.
ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES Con Edison of New York has not engaged to a material extent in trading activities that are accounted for at fair value. See "Financial Market Risks" above.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS For information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment, including the Superfund, and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos, see NoteF to the financial statements.
IMPACT OF INFLATION Con Edison of New York is affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Company to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of its plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement 71 will substantially exceed historical cost. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Company's long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company's results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of OperationsSummary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. The Company's principal business segments are its electric, gas and steam businesses. For additional information about its business segments, see NoteL to the financial statements.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2002 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2001 Electric Con Edison of New York's electric operating revenues in 2002 decreased $575.2million compared with 2001, reflecting primarily lower fuel and purchased power costs of $226.9million (discussed below). The decrease also reflects the completion in March2002 of amortizations of a previously deferred gain on the sale of divested plants and a previously deferred NYPA revenue increase ($43.3million), a reserve established in 2002 for earnings in excess of a specified rate of return that are to be retained for customer benefit in accordance with the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement ($40.0million), a reserve established in 2002 related to the sale of the Company's nuclear generating unit ($24.8million), the amortization of the loss ($29.9million) related to the sale of the Company's nuclear generating unit and rate reductions and other amortizations in accordance with the Company's rate agreements. The decrease in electric operating revenues was offset, in part, by an increase in electric sales revenues ($24.0million) reflecting principally the hot summer weather. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" and "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Electricity delivery volume in Con Edison of New York's service territory increased 1.6percent in 2002 compared with 2001. The increase reflects the impact of the hot summer weather, offset in part, by the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, electricity delivery volume in the service territory increased 0.5percent in the 2002 period.
The Company's electric purchased power costs decreased $174.6million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to a decrease in the price of purchased power and an increase in volumes of electricity purchased from other suppliers by participants in the retail access programs. This decrease was offset in part by the Company's increased purchased volumes resulting from the sale of the Company's nuclear generating unit in September2001 and the hot summer weather in 2002. Fuel costs decreased $52.3million as a result of decreased generation at Company-owned power plants. In general, the Company recovers prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the PSC. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
The Company's electric operating income decreased $92.7million in 2002 compared with 2001. The principal component of the decrease was lower net electric revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $348.3million. The decrease in net electric revenues reflects the sale of the nuclear generation unit and the same factors (other than lower fuel and purchased power costs) as discussed above with respect to the decrease in electric operating income. The decrease in net electric 72 revenues was offset in part by reduced other operations and maintenance expenses ($136.8million) reflecting nuclear production expenses incurred in 2001 but not in 2002, and productivity improvements, lower depreciation and amortization expense ($31.5million) and lower revenue taxes ($26.2million). The decrease is also offset by lower operating income tax of $61.8million.
Gas Con Edison of New York's gas operating revenues decreased $223.4million, resulting primarily from the lower cost of purchased gas ($194.2million) in 2002 compared with 2001. The lower cost of purchased gas reflects primarily lower unit costs. The lower revenues also reflect reduced sales volumes, resulting primarily from the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and revenue reductions implemented in accordance with the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in April2002. Gas operating income decreased $7.9million in 2002, reflecting a $29.2million decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale), and increased property tax expense ($9.6million), offset in part by reduced operations and maintenance expenses ($16.2million), reduced revenue taxes ($10.3million) and lower income taxes ($8.7million).
Gas sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 3.5percent in the year ended December31, 2002 compared with the year ended December31, 2001. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the Company's service territory decreased 1.5percent in the 2002 period.
The Company's gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. A weather-normalization provision that applies to the Company's gas business moderates, but does not completely eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on gas operating income.
Steam Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues decreased $99.7million. The lower revenues reflect reduced sales volumes and lower fuel and purchased power costs primarily as a result of the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. The lower fuel and purchased power costs reflect primarily lower unit costs. Steam operating income increased $8.2million for 2002 compared with 2001 due primarily to reduced operations and maintenance expenses of $9.3million and lower income taxes of $10.5million, offset in part by a decrease in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $11.1million. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Steam sales volume decreased 3.2percent in the year ended December31, 2002 compared with the year ended December31, 2001, reflecting primarily the loss of the World Trade Center as a customer, the mild winter weather in the first quarter of 2002 and the soft economy. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days in each period, steam sales volume decreased 1.4percent.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At $1.0billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of Con Edison of New York's largest operating expenses.
73 The principal components of, and variations in, operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 629.8 $ 9.4 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 326.9 (37.6 ) Payroll taxes 54.4 (1.7 ) Other taxes 28.3 2.0 Total $ 1,039.4 * $ (27.9 ) *Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2002 were $1,351.0million.
Effective in 2003, New York City increased the Company's annual property taxes by $96million. Under the Company's rate agreements, the Company is deferring the property tax increase as a regulatory asset to be recovered from customers.
Other Income Investment income decreased $4.1million in 2002 compared to 2001, due principally to reduced interest income earned on short-term cash investments in the 2002 period as compared to the 2001 period. For the 2001 period, the Company had more cash on hand than the 2002 period, primarily as a result of the sale of its nuclear generating unit. Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased $8.2million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflecting the East River Repowering Project. Other income increased $41.7million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to $26.7million of interest income on a federal income tax refund claim, a $10.2million write-off in 2001 of an investment in the New York Discovery Fund in 2001, a $9.4million increase in interest earned on regulatory assets (See "Application of Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Regulated Public UtilitiesSFAS No.71," above), offset in part by reduced income of $2.5million from non-utility operations. Income tax expense decreased $4.4million in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits relating to the September2001 sale of the Company's nuclear generating unit.
Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $6.6million in the twelve months ended December31, 2002 compared to the twelve months ended December31, 2001. The increase reflects principally the interest expense associated with a net federal income tax deficiency related to a prior period audit ($19.1million), partially offset by decreased interest expense on long-term debt of $14.9million.
Income Tax Federal income tax decreased $28.6million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax and deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. In 2000, New York State implemented a tax law change that reduced or repealed certain revenue-based taxes and replaced them with the imposition of a net income-based tax. State income taxes decreased $56.8million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting lower income before tax, lowering of the tax rate and prior period adjustments. The state income tax expense is offset against the savings from the eliminated or reduced revenue taxes. Any over- or under- 74 collection of these taxes is deferred for return to, or recovery from, customers. See Notes A and L to the financial statements.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2001 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER31, 2000 Electric Con Edison of New York's electric operating revenues in 2001 decreased $116.7million from 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects decreased purchased power costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements) and electric rate reductions of $374.5million, offset by economic growth and the effects of the warmer than normal summer weather when compared to cooler than normal weather for the 2000 period.
Electricity sales volume in the Company's service territory increased 3.0percent in 2001. The increase in sales volume reflects the warmer than normal summer weather and economic growth. The Company's electric sales vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the summer. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, electricity sales volume in Con Edison of New York's service territory increased 2.4percent in 2001.
The Company's electric operating income increased $90.5million in 2001 compared with 2000. The increase in electric operating income was primarily comprised of an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) of $63.6million. The increase in net revenues reflects principally increased sales ($64.1million), recognition of revenue related to previously deferred NYPA rate increases ($35.2million), gain on the sale of divested generating plants ($37.5million), increased revenues associated with system benefits charges ($32.8million), recovery of incremental NUG cost ($31.0million), reconciliation of state income tax and gross receipts tax ($110.8million; see "Income Tax," below) and non-recurring charges in 2000 for replacement power costs ($130.0million), offset by electric rate reductions of $374.5million. Electric operating income also increased due to decreased other operations and maintenance expenses of $108.4million (discussed below) and decreased depreciation expense of $73.6million, offset in part by increased property taxes of $33.7million, federal income tax of $40.1million and state income tax of $98.8million (see "Income Tax," below).
The $108.4million decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses reflects principally lower expenses related to the Company's nuclear generating unit which was sold in September2001 ($98.4million), increased pension credits ($42.5million) and decreased transmission expenses ($9.9million), offset in part by higher distribution expenses for the relocation of Company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($13.4million) and increased system benefits charges ($32.8million).
Gas Con Edison of New York's gas operating revenues increased $186.6million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting increased cost of purchased gas, offset in part by a reduction in customers' bills of $20.0million, reflecting a refund of previously deferred credits and other provisions of the gas rate agreement approved by the PSC in November2000. Operating income in 2001 increased $1.6million compared with 2000, reflecting an increase in net revenues (operating revenues less gas purchased for resale) of $11.2million and increased pension credits of $8.2million, offset in part by increased depreciation and 75 amortization expense ($3.9million), increased state income tax ($8.2million; see "Income Tax" below), increased uncollectible account write-offs ($1.9million) and higher distribution expenses for the relocation of Company facilities to avoid interference with municipal infrastructure projects ($3.0million).
Gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers decreased 0.4percent in 2001 compared with 2000.
The Company's gas sales and transportation volumes vary seasonally in response to weather and peak in the winter. The decrease in volume in 2001 compared with 2000 reflects the warmer 2001 winter compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, gas sales and transportation volume to firm customers increased 2.8percent in 2001.
Steam Con Edison of New York's steam operating revenues increased $51.6million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting primarily increased purchased steam and fuel costs (see "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements). Steam operating income increased $2.3million in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting an October2000 rate increase of $16.6million.
Steam sales volume decreased 5.3percent in 2001 and increased 0.8percent in 2000. The decrease in 2001 reflects the mild 2001 winter weather compared with 2000. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, in each period, steam sales volume decreased 2.7percent in 2001.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The principal components of and variations in operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2001 Amount 2001 compared to 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 620.4 $ 33.6 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 364.5 (19.2 ) Payroll taxes 56.2 1.1 Other taxes 26.3 3.5 Total $ 1,067.4 * $ 19.0 *Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes billed to customers in 2001 were $1,414.4million.
Other Income Other income increased $0.9million in 2001 compared with 2000, due principally to deferred federal income tax credits realized, offset by a write-off in 2001 of an investment of $10.2million in the New York City Discovery Fund.
Net Interest Charges Net interest charges increased $16.0million in 2001, compared with 2000, reflecting principally $28.4million of increased interest expense for Con Edison of New York related to long-term borrowings, offset in part by a decrease of $8.4million related to short-term borrowings and $7.0million of interest accrued on the net after tax gain from generation divestiture prior to regulatory disposition of the gain in 2000. See NoteI to the financial statements.
76 Income Tax Federal income tax increased $19.7million in 2001, reflecting the change in income before tax, deductions related to removal costs and tax credits. State income taxes increased $117.5million in 2001 compared with 2000 as the result of the change in New York State tax law, offset by a corresponding increase in other operating revenues for taxes no longer applicable but still being recovered through rates. See Notes A and J to the financial statements.
77 MANAGEMENT'S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONSORANGE AND ROCKLAND UTILITIES,INC.
Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R or the Company), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison), meets the conditions specified in General Instruction I of Form10-K and is permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly-owned subsidiaries of companies, like Con Edison, that are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, this O&R Management's Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations is included in this report, and O&R has omitted from this report the information called for by PartII, Item 7 of Form10-K (Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of O&R and its subsidiaries and the notes thereto. Information in the notes referred to in this narrative analysis is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as "see" or "refer to" shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this narrative analysis the information to which reference is made.
O&R'S BUSINESS O&R is a regulated utility that, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania and gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SUMMARY O&R's net income for common stock for the year ended December31, 2002, was $44.9million, $4.7million higher than the corresponding 2001 period. The increase in the Company's net income was attributable primarily to higher electric sales volumes due to warmer than normal weather, customer growth and higher average usage, which produced an additional $7.3million of net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power costs). While firm gas volumes were down slightly, gas net revenues increased by $0.8million due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off-system gas sales. Income taxes and revenue taxes decreased by $3.2million due to lowered tax rates in New York. The higher net revenues and lower taxes were partially offset by $4.9million in higher interest charges that resulted from a change by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) to the carrying charges allowed on the Company's deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey. This expense was offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1.4million. Operation and maintenance costs increased by $1.2million and depreciation charges were $1.2million higher.
See "Results of OperationsBusiness Segments" below for further analysis of earnings.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES O&R's financial statements reflect the application of its accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies.
78 The application of certain of these accounting policies requires the Company to use estimates. These estimates require the Company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and for which different estimates that could reasonably have been used could have resulted in material differences in its financial statements.
Accounting for Regulated Public UtilitiesSFAS No.71 O&R is a regulated public utility subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, is subject to the accounting requirements and rate making practices of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
O&R's principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Company is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Company's regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits O&R and its subsidiaries provide pension and other postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." In applying these accounting policies, the Company has made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, future compensation and health care cost trends, and appropriate discount rates. See Notes D and E to the financial statements for information about these assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Plan expense or credit in future periods will depend on the assumptions the Company makes and the actual performance of the pension fund.
In accordance with SFAS No.71 and consistent with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility authorities, O&R defers as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the amounts reflected in rates for such expenses.
An actuarial valuation of Con Edison's pension plan's funded status (which applies to both Con Edison of New York and O&R) was performed as of December31, 2002. The valuation showed that the fair value 79 of the pension plan assets exceeded its Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) at December31, 2002. However, the fair market value of Con Edison's pension plan assets could fall below the plan's ABO in future years. In that event, O&R would be required, under SFAS No.87 and SFAS No.132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pension and Postretirement Benefits," to accrue a liability equal in the amount to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the ABO, less its accrued pension liability through a charge to other comprehensive income (OCI). The charge to OCI, which would be net of taxes, would not affect O&R's net income.
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.5, "Accounting for Contingencies," applies to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company's known material contingencies include workers' compensation claims, and its responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, that have been used or generated in the course of its operations. See NoteF to the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No.5, the Company has accrued estimates of its losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company's results of operations (which were discussed above under "Results of OperationsSummary") are discussed below for each of its business segments. The Company's principal business segments are its electric and gas utility businesses. For additional information about its business segments, see NoteP to the financial statements.
Electric Electric operating revenues decreased $62.9million during 2002 compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower purchased power costs and tax recoveries in 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Electric sales volumes in 2002 increased 5.8percent compared to 2001 due to warmer than normal summer weather, customer growth and higher average usage. After adjusting for weather variations, total electricity sales volumes were 3.2percent higher in 2002. Net electric revenues (operating revenues less purchased power) were $7.3million higher in 2002 than in 2001.
Purchased power costs decreased $70.2million during 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting decreases in the unit cost of purchased power and increased volumes of electricity purchased by customers from other suppliers, partially offset by higher energy usage by full-service customers.
Electric operating income increased $7.3million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This increase reflects the impact of higher net electric revenues along with lower New York state and local income and revenue taxes, offset in part by higher operation and maintenance charges and depreciation costs.
80 Gas Gas operating revenues decreased $39.0million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This decrease was primarily the result of lower gas costs and sales to firm customers in 2002. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
Total firm gas sales volumes in 2002 decreased 1.1percent compared to 2001. Revenues from gas sales in New York are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. After adjusting for weather variations in each period, total firm sales and transportation volumes were 0.3percent lower for 2002 compared to 2001. Net gas revenues (operating revenues less purchased gas) were $0.7million higher in 2002 due primarily to incentives earned from interruptible and off-system gas sales.
The cost of gas purchased for resale was $39.8million less in 2002 than in 2001, reflecting lower sales volumes and unit costs.
Decreased gas revenues also reflect the reduced requirement for the Company to buy gas for resale because of an increase in the purchase of gas by customers from other suppliers.
Gas operating income increased by $1.4million in 2002, compared to 2001, due primarily to higher net revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, offset in part by lower late payment charge revenues and higher depreciation.
Other Operations and Maintenance Other operations and maintenance expense increased $1.2million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was attributable primarily to higher electric transmission and distribution expenditures, partially offset by lower customer bad debt and collections expense.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes decreased by $1.5million in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of lower New York State revenue taxes of $2.7million, which resulted from reduced tax rates and lower energy costs billed to customers. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher property taxes of $0.9million.
The principal components of, and variations, in operating taxes were: Increase/(Decrease) 2002 Amount 2002 compared to 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Property taxes $ 27.3 $ 0.9 State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 21.2 (2.7 ) Payroll taxes 3.8 0.1 Other taxes 0.1 0.2 Total $ 52.4 * $ (1.5 ) * Including sales tax on customers' bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2002 was $70.8million.
81 Net Interest Charges Interest charges increased by $4.1million in 2002 compared to 2001, primarily as a result of a change by the NJBPU in the carrying charges allowed on the Company's deferred purchased power balance in New Jersey ($4.9million) and lower allowance for borrowed funds used during construction ($0.6million). These expenses were offset in part by lower net financing costs of $1.4million that resulted from lower average debt balances and interest rates in 2002.
Income Taxes Income taxes decreased by $1.6million in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting primarily lower state income taxes. State income taxes decreased primarily as a result of a 0.5percent reduction in the New York State tax rate. Excluding certain taxes in New York that are reconciled to amounts included in rates, income taxes increased by $1.7million due primarily to higher operating income in 2002.
82 ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Con Edison For information about Con Edison's primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial Market Risks" in Con Edison's MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
Con Edison of New York For information about Con Edison of New York's primary market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, see "Financial Market Risks" in Con Edison of New York's MD&A in Item 7 (which information is incorporated herein by reference).
O&R O&R's primary financial market risks are interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including utility construction expenditures and maturing debt securities. O&R and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Company estimates that, as of December31, 2002, a 10percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt of $45.0million would result in a change in annual interest expense of $0.1million.
In addition, O&R and its subsidiaries from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See NoteP to the financial statements.
Commodity Price Risk O&R's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity and gas that the Company delivers to its customers. The Company has risk management strategies to mitigate its related exposure and uses derivative instruments to hedge this price risk. See NoteP to the financial statements.
In general, the rates O&R and its subsidiaries charge customers for electric and gas service fluctuate with the cost of purchased power, gas purchased for resale and fuel used in the generation of electricity, including gains or losses on certain derivative instruments and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA to the financial statements.
O&R estimates that, as of December31, 2002, a 10percent change in market prices would result in a change in fair value of $1.7million for the derivative instruments used by it to hedge purchases of electricity and gas. The Company expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased.
Credit Risk O&R is exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for various energy supply and hedging activities. Credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterparty's 83 nonperformance. The Company uses credit policies to manage its credit risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, master netting agreements, and credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, or prepayment arrangements.
Investment Risk O&R's investment risk relates to the investment of the assets in the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See "Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," in PartII Item 7.

95 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These notes form an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison) and its subsidiaries.
Con Edison Con Edison is a holding company that provides a wide range of energy-related and telecommunications services to its customers through its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries. Con Edison's core business is energy distribution and it is also pursuing related growth opportunities in competitive businesses.
Con Edison's principal subsidiary is Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc. (Con Edison of New York), a regulated utility that provides electric service to over 3.1million customers and gas service to approximately 1.1million customers in New York City and Westchester County. It also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan.
Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R), a regulated utility that Con Edison acquired in July1999, provides electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania. O&R also provides gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Con Edison has four unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Solutions,Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a retail energy services company that sells electricity, gas and energy-related services to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and O&R; Consolidated Edison Energy,Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a wholesale energy supply company; Consolidated Edison Development,Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that owns and operates generating plants and energy and other infrastructure projects; and Con Edison Communications, LLC (Con Edison Communications), a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks to provide telecommunications services. The unregulated subsidiaries participate in competitive energy supply and services businesses that are subject to different risks than those found in the businesses of the regulated utility subsidiaries.
NoteA - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation Con Edison's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Con Edison and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the regulated utilities, Con Edison of New York and O&R. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For regulated public utilities, like Con Edison of New York and O&R, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America include the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.
96 SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
Con Edison's principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the consolidated balance sheet. The company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The company's regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
The standards in SFAS No.101, "Regulated Enterprises - Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of the FASB Statement No.71," have been applied to Con Edison's regulated electric supply business, including electric generating assets (see NoteI) and non-utility generator (NUG) contracts (see NoteH) and related regulatory assets and liabilities, following the 1997 Restructuring Agreement (defined below). The application of SFAS No.101 to the electric supply business had no material effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of Con Edison.
Other significant accounting policies of the company are referenced in NoteD (Pension Benefits), NoteE (Other Postretirement Benefits), NoteJ (Leases), NoteK (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and NoteO (Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities) to the financial statements.
Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric In September1997, the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended March31, 2002, a reasonable opportunity for recovery of "strandable costs" and the divestiture of electric generation capacity by Con Edison of New York.
At December31, 2002, approximately 163,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing approximately 25percent of aggregate customer load were purchasing electricity from other suppliers under the electric retail access program (which is available to all of Con Edison of New York's electric customers). Con Edison of New York delivers electricity to customers in this program through its regulated transmission and distribution systems. In general, Con Edison of New York's delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable Con Edison of New York customers, less an amount reflecting costs otherwise associated with supplying customers with energy and capacity.
97 Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates, on an annual basis, by $129million in 1998, $80million in April1999, $103million in April2000 and $209million in April2001. The effect of the April2001 decrease for the rate year ended March31, 2002 was partially offset by recognition in income of $36million relating to rates for distributing electricity to customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and $50million (after tax) of deferred generation divestiture gain. Rates were also reduced, on an annual basis, effective September2001 by $313million to reflect the divestiture of the nuclear generating facility and the Roseton generating plant, which resulted in a reduction in operating and other expenses. See NoteI.
Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, as amended by a July1998 PSC order, Con Edison of New York sold approximately 7,790 MW of the approximately 8,300 MW of generating capacity that it owned at the time the 1997 Restructuring Agreement was executed. See NoteI.
In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that revises and extends the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000.
In general, under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York's base electric transmission and distribution rates will not otherwise be changed during the five-year period ending March2005 except (i)with respect to certain changes in costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements, inflation in excess of a 4percent annual rate, property tax changes and environmental cost increases or (ii)if the PSC determines that circumstances have occurred that either threaten Con Edison of New York's economic viability or ability to provide, safe and adequate service, or render Con Edison of New York's rate of return unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service.
Under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December2001, 35percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March2002 through 2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity will be retained for shareholders and the balance will be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. As of December31, 2002, Con Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve of $40million for the rate year ending March2003. There was no sharing of earnings for the rate years ended March2002 and 2001. The earnings threshold for rate years ending March2003 through March2005 of 11.75percent can be increased up to 50 basis points. The threshold will increase by 25 basis points if certain demand reductions and supply increases exceed targeted projections and by an additional 25 basis points if certain customer service and reliability objectives are achieved. Con Edison of New York could be required to pay up to $40million annually in penalties if certain threshold service and reliability objectives are not achieved.
Con Edison of New York's potential electric strandable costs are utility investments and commitments that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market. Con Edison of New York is recovering these costs in the rates it charges all of its electric customers. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the stranded cost recovery provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, stating that Con Edison of New York "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and 98 strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments, under the parameters and during the time periods set forth therein." The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" below.
In 1997, the PSC approved a four-year O&R restructuring plan effective through December31, 2002, pursuant to which O&R sold all of its generating assets, made retail access available to all of its electric customers effective May1999 and reduced its electric rates by $32.4million through rate reductions implemented in December1997 and 1998. In 1998 and 1999, similar plans for O&R's utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were approved by state regulators. The Pennsylvania plan provided for retail access for all customers effective May1999. The New Jersey plan provided for retail access for all customers effective August1999 and rate reductions of $6.8million effective August1999, an additional reduction of $2.7million effective January2001 and a final reduction of $6.2million effective August2002.
In accordance with the April1999 PSC order approving Con Edison's acquisition of O&R, Con Edison of New York has reduced its annual electric and gas rates by $12million and $2million, respectively, and O&R has reduced its annual electric rates and gas rates by $6.1million and $1.1million, respectively.
In October2002, O&R's New Jersey utility subsidiary filed a request with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) seeking an increase in electric rates of $7.3million (5.5percent) annually, to take effect on August1, 2003, principally to reflect the costs of electric system infrastructure improvements required for service reliability and security. A final ruling by the NJBPU is expected in the third quarter of 2003.
Gas In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000.
Under the 2000 agreement, the rate of return on gas common equity above which Con Edison of New York shared with customers 50percent of earnings was increased from 13percent to 14percent. In addition, customer bills were reduced by $20million during the January through March2001 period.
At December31, 2001, Con Edison of New York reserved $11.5million for customers' share of gas earnings in excess of the 14percent threshold for the rate year ended September2001. No additional amounts were reserved for the rate year ended September2002.
In April2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces gas rates, on an annualized basis, by $25million.
During the term of the 2002 agreement, Con Edison of New York retains 100percent of the rate year return on equity up to 11.5percent. If the return on equity is between 11.5percent and 12.0percent, 99 100percent of the incremental return over 11.5percent will be set aside for customer benefit. If the return on equity is above 12.0percent, 50percent of the incremental return over 12.0percent will be retained by shareholders, and the remaining 50percent will be shared with customers.
The 2002 agreement also continued the retail access credit for firm transportation customers and other programs designed to increase customer and marketer participation in the gas retail access program, the net costs of which are to be recovered from customers.
Under the 2002 agreement, in May2002, Con Edison of New York established a $36.4million reserve, funded by previously deferred customer credits, to recover unreimbursed costs directly related to the World Trade Center attack.
In December2000, the PSC also authorized implementation of a gas rate settlement agreement between O&R, the PSC staff, and certain other parties covering the period November2000 through April2002. In October2001, the PSC approved an extension of this agreement covering the period May2002 through October2003. With limited exceptions, the agreement provides for no changes to base rates. O&R was permitted to retain, and is amortizing to income, $18.1million of deferred credits that otherwise would have been credited to customers.
In November2002, O&R filed a request with the PSC for approval of a $27.2million gas rate increase effective November2003. O&R also submitted a multi-year plan that addresses rates for two additional years, with an increase of $2.5million to cover infrastructure costs, inflation and property taxes. The Administrative Law Judge is expected to issue a recommended decision in the third quarter 2003.
Steam In November2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that provided for a $16.6million steam rate increase in October2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004. Con Edison of New York is required to share with customers 50percent of any earnings for any rate year covered by the agreement above of a specified rate of return on steam common equity (11.0percent for the first rate year, the 12-month period ended September2001; 10.5percent thereafter if the repowering of its steam-electric generating plant is not completed). The net revenue effect associated with sales increases related to colder than normal winter weather (November through April) will be excluded from any earnings measurement. Earnings on steam common equity did not exceed the specific rates of return for the rate years ended September30, 2001 and 2002.
Under the steam rate agreement, upon completion of the project to add incremental generating capacity at the East River steam-electric generating plant, the net benefits of the project (including the net after-tax gain from the sale of a nine-acre development site in mid-town Manhattan along the East River) allocable to steam operations will inure to the benefit of steam customers.
The agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased steam and fuel costs and requires Con Edison of New York to develop a strategy for hedging price variations for a portion of the steam produced each year.
100 Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property, together with removal cost, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with PSC and FERC regulations. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities' own funds were credited to other income (deductions).
Con Edison's utility subsidiaries generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors. Con Edison's utility depreciation rates averaged 3.0percent in 2002, 3.1percent in 2001 and 3.6percent in 2000. The estimated lives for Con Edison's utility plant range from 5 to 80years for electric, 7 to 75years for gas, 30 to 75years for steam and 5 to 50years for general plant.
Non-utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the regulated utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication facilities that are currently not utilized within utility operations. For the unregulated subsidiaries, non-utility plant consists primarily of generating assets and telecommunication facilities that are in-service or under construction. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 5 to 40years for generating assets and 3 to 50years for other property.
In 2002, in accordance with SFAS No.34, "Capitalization of Interest Costs," Con Edison capitalized interest on its borrowings associated with the unregulated subsidiaries' capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such capitalized interest cost for 2002 is $14.3million. No amounts were capitalized in 2001 and 2000.
Revenues Con Edison's utility subsidiaries and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas or steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. O&R and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy usage not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. The accrued unbilled revenue included in Con Edison's balance sheet at December31, 2002 and 2001 was $54.1million and $47.7million, respectively.
Recoverable Energy Costs Con Edison's utility subsidiaries generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the 101 applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed energy costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customer during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). For Con Edison of New York, the rate provisions also include a possible incentive or penalty of up to $25million annually relating to electric costs (see "Energy Price Hedging" in NoteO). Con Edison of New York defers over a 12-month period all net interruptible gas revenues not authorized by the PSC to be retained by Con Edison of New York for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers.
In August2002, O&R's New Jersey utility subsidiary submitted a petition to the NJBPU requesting recovery under New Jersey's 1999 Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of $110million of electric purchased power costs in excess of amounts previously billed to customers, associated interest and other deferred charges. Recovery of these costs from customers is requested over a four-year period or pursuant to a plan to securitize the costs (under which O&R's subsidiary would be reimbursed these costs with the proceeds of a financing that would be repaid over time by its customers). In January2003, the initial results of an independent audit, commissioned by the NJBPU to review the prudence of these deferred costs, were issued. The audit recommends that the utility be disallowed recovery of $26.8million of such costs and associated interest of $2.6million. O&R believes that its actions were prudent and has filed a response to the audit findings. A decision on the recovery of these purchased power costs by the NJBPU is expected in the third quarter of 2003.
The difference between amounts for purchased power initially billed to the utility subsidiaries by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and amounts subsequently determined by the NYISO to have actually been supplied by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the utility subsidiaries, or paid to the NYISO by the utility subsidiaries. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the utility subsidiaries' customers. At December31, 2002, the utility subsidiaries had deferred $106.9million of refunds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability.
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. Con Edison considers temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries, which, depending on the subsidiaries' percentage ownership, are recorded at cost, accounted for under the equity method or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases." See NoteJ for a discussion of investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions.
Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," Con Edison has recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the utility subsidiaries have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the 102 future as a result of the reversal or "turn-around" of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the utility subsidiaries have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense (see NoteL). In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No.109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries filea consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays tax or receives a benefit based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.
State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed effective January1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to the tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and the tax expense resulting from the tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated in base rates.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries filea combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives a benefit based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
Taxes Other than Income Taxes The PSC requires New York regulated utility companies to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is part of the PSC approved revenue requirement within each of the respective rate agreements.
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs relating to specific utility construction projects are capitalized. All other such costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000 amounting to $11.2million, $14.0million and $14.1million, respectively, were charged to operating expenses. No research and development costs were capitalized in these years.
Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Earnings Per Common Share In accordance with SFAS No.128, "Earnings per Share," Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share is calculated by 103 dividing earnings available to common shareholders ("Net income for common stock" on the consolidated income statement) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.
Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock and stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of the common shares during the reporting period. See NoteM.
Basic and diluted EPS are calculated as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars/Share Data in Thousands) Net income $ 680.6 $ 695.8 $ 596.4 Less: Preferred stock dividend requirements 12.5 13.6 13.6 Income available to common shareholders $ 668.1 $ 682.2 $ 582.8 Less cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax 22.1 - - Net income applicable to common stock $ 646.0 $ 682.2 $ 582.8 Number of shares on which basic EPS is calculated 212,990 212,147 212,186 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of dilutive securities: 1,060 773 232 Number of share on which diluted EPS is calculated 214,050 212,920 212,418 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - BASIC Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 3.14 $ 3.22 $ 2.75 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 0.11 - - After cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 3.03 $ 3.22 $ 2.75 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 3.13 $ 3.21 $ 2.74 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 0.11 - - After cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 3.02 $ 3.21 $ 2.74 Stock options to purchase 6.08million, 5.33million and 4.67million common shares for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were not included in the respective period's computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the option was greater than the average market price of the common shares.
Stock-Based Compensation Con Edison applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. See NoteM. The following table illustrates the effect on net 104 income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to stock-based employee compensation.
For the Years Ended December31, 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars/Share Data in Thousands) Net income, as reported $ 646 $ 682 $ 583 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 6 3 1 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of related tax effects (13 ) (7 ) (6 ) Pro forma net income 639 678 578 Number of shares on which basic EPS is calculated 212,990 212,147 212,186 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of dilutive securities: 1,060 773 232 Number of share on which diluted EPS is calculated 214,050 212,920 212,418 Earnings per share: Basic - as reported $ 3.03 $ 3.22 $ 2.75 Basic - pro forma $ 3.00 $ 3.19 $ 2.72 Diluted - as reported $ 3.02 $ 3.21 $ 2.74 Diluted - pro forma $ 2.99 $ 3.18 $ 2.71 These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future year pro forma amount disclosures due to changes in future market conditions and additional grants in future years.
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NoteB - Capitalization Capitalization of Con Edison Con Edison's outstanding capitalization, on a consolidated basis, consists of its common shareholders' equity and long-term debt and the outstanding preferred stock and long-term debt of its subsidiaries. Con Edison's authorized capitalization also includes six million authorized, but unissued, Preferred Shares, $1.00 par value.
Preferred Stock of Utility Subsidiaries As of December31, 2002, 1,915,319 shares of Con Edison of New York's $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "$5 Preferred") and 375,626 shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value) were outstanding.
Dividends on the $5 Preferred stock are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $4.65 per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred dividends 105 must be declared by Con Edison of New York's Board of Trustees to become payable. See "Dividends" below.
With respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison (which owns all of the 235,488,094 shares of Con Edison of New York's Common Shares ($2.50 par value) that are outstanding) and the holders of the $5 Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock have no right to vote; provided, however, that, if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share with respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods, the holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the election of Con Edison of New York's Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, Con Edison of New York may not create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. Con Edison of New York may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $101 per share (in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends). In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the company's common stock, the holders of the $5 Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled to receive $100 per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case together with all accrued and unpaid dividends.
Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that the utility subsidiaries may pay are limited to not more than 100percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of "income available for dividends" are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiary's equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.
In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New York common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.
Long-term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2003-2007 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $473 * 2004 163 2005 464 2006 17 2007 368 * Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275million of Con Edison of New York's Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series1996A in January2003.
106 Long-term debt includes notes issued by O&R to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) for the net proceeds of NYSERDA's $55million aggregate principal amount of Series1994A and $44million aggregate principal amount of Series1995A Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds. The interest rate determination method for this debt is subject to change in accordance with the related indenture, and the debt currently bears interest at a weekly rate determined by its remarketing agent. The debt is subject to optional and, in certain circumstances, mandatory tender for purchase by O&R. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteO.
Long-term debt is stated at cost, which, as of December31, 2002, approximates fair value (estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities), except for $224.6million of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteO.
At December31, 2002, long-term debt includes $23.2million of mortgage bonds collateralized by substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of O&R's New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries, and $148.8million of debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a pledge of a power plant, a related power purchase agreement and project assets. At December31, 2002, restricted cash was $14.6million relating to this project.
Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions, under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison, Con Edison of New York or O&R. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of Con Edison of New York and O&R are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of Con Edison of New York and O&R to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. Certain series of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing (Series1993A, B and C, Series1994A and Series1995A), aggregating $476.8million, each contain as events of default a default in the payment of the other series and events of default under the company's mortgage trust indenture (which has been satisfied and discharged). The arrangements for the other series of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing (Series1999A, 2001A and 2001B), aggregating $615.3million, and O&R's tax-exempt financing (Series1994A and Series1995A), aggregating $99.0million, include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default occurred, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied may and, in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.
107 The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the company does not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the company shall not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($100million for Con Edison of New York; $12.5million for O&R).
NoteC - Short Term Borrowing At December31, 2002, Con Edison and its utility subsidiaries had commercial paper programs under which short-term borrowings are made at prevailing market rates, totaling $950million. These programs are supported by revolving credit agreements with banks. At December31, 2002, $149.5million, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.2percent, was outstanding under Con Edison's $350million program; no commercial paper was outstanding under Con Edison of New York's $500million program; and $1million, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.3percent, was outstanding under O&R's $100million program. Con Edison of New York changes the amount of its program from time to time, subject to a $1billion FERC-authorized limit.
Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreements total $950million, of which $775million was renewed in November2002. The commitments may terminate upon a change of control of Con Edison, and borrowings under the agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio (calculated in accordance with the agreements) of debt to total capital of the borrower not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1. At December31, 2002, this ratio was 0.54 to 1 for Con Edison, 0.53 to 1 for Con Edison of New York and 0.49 to 1 for O&R. Borrowings under the agreements are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels. The fees charged for the revolving credit facilities and borrowings under the agreements reflect the credit ratings of the respective companies.
During 2002, Con Edison borrowed funds on a short-term basis from an affiliate of the lessor of the Newington Project. See NoteS. The average daily outstanding amount was $28.9million at an average interest rate of 4.2percent. At December31, 2002, $11.1million was outstanding at an interest rate of 4.2percent.
NoteD - Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York and O&R and certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period. This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) and is permitted under SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.71, O&R defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87 and the current rate allowance authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction in which it operates.

NoteE - Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison of New York and O&R have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses.
Con Edison of New York also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. O&R has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees.
Certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries are eligible to receive benefits under these programs. The company has reserved the right to amend or terminate these programs.
Investment plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for Con Edison of New York and O&R. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.
For O&R, plan assets are used to pay benefits and expenses for participants who retired on or after January1, 1995. O&R pays benefits for other participants who retired prior to January1, 1995. Plan assets include amounts owed by the trust to O&R of $0.8million in 2002, $0.3million in 2001, $2.2million in 2000.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.71, O&R defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 110 Than Pensions," and the current rate allowance authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction in which it operates.
The components of Con Edison of New York and O&R's net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Service cost $ 10.0 $ 12.2 $ 10.7 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 87.7 88.4 78.8 Expected return on plan assets (79.7 ) (73.8 ) (62.3 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 24.2 10.2 1.2 Amortization of prior service cost (0.1 ) 1.4 1.4 Amortization of transition obligation 5.0 17.4 17.4 NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ 47.1 $ 55.8 $ 47.2 Cost capitalized/deferred 13.8 13.2 10.3 Cost charged to operating expenses 33.3 42.6 36.9 The funded status of the programs at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,351.1 $ 1,169.8 $ 1,012.5 Service cost 10.0 12.2 10.7 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 87.7 88.4 78.8 Plan amendments (305.6 ) - (0.4 ) Net actuarial loss 177.6 148.7 127.6 Benefits paid and administrative expenses (89.1 ) (82.0 ) (71.4 ) Participant contributions 15.7 14.0 12.0 BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR $ 1,247.4 $ 1,351.1 $ 1,169.8 CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 804.2 $ 844.1 $ 872.3 Actual return on plan assets (61.3 ) (29.3 ) 4.4 Employer contributions 44.9 55.9 23.5 Participant contributions 15.6 13.9 11.9 Benefits paid (81.9 ) (75.5 ) (62.9 ) Administrative expenses (4.5 ) (4.9 ) (5.1 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR $ 717.0 $ 804.2 $ 844.1 Funded status $ (530.4 ) $ (546.9 ) $ (325.7 ) Unrecognized net (gain)/loss 505.5 210.9 (32.1 ) Unrecognized prior service costs (147.9 ) 8.0 9.4 Unrecognized transition obligation at January 1, 1993* 36.7 191.4 208.8 ACCRUED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ (136.1 ) $ (136.6 ) $ (139.6 ) * Being amortized over a period of 20years and reduced by an additional amount in 2002 due to plan amendments.
111 The actuarial assumptions for Con Edison of New York and O&R at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Discount rate 6.75% 7.50% 7.75% EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS Tax-exempt assets 9.20% 9.20% 8.50% Taxable assets: Con Edison of New York 8.20% 8.20% 7.50% O&R 8.70% 8.70% 8.00% The health care cost trend rate assumed for 2003 is 9.0percent. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75percent for 2009 and remain at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: 1-Percentage-Point Increase 1-Percentage-Point Decrease (Millions of Dollars) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 129.0 $ (114.7 ) Effect on service cost and interest cost components $ 11.8 $ (10.3 ) NoteF - Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of Con Edison's utility subsidiaries and are present in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by the utility subsidiaries.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) and similar state statutes impose joint and several strict liabilities, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for resulting removal and remediation costs and environmental damages. Liabilities under these laws can be material and in some instances may be imposed without regard to fault, or may be imposed for past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred.
The environmental remediation costs for the sites at which Con Edison's utility subsidiaries have been asserted to have liability for remediation under Superfund or similar state statutes, including their manufactured gas sites, (Superfund Sites) include investigation, demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring costs.
For sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the utility subsidiaries are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the liability accrued represents the company's estimate of what it will need to pay to settle its obligations with respect to the site. For other sites, the liability accrued represents the company's estimate of its investigation and remediation costs for the site. In either case, the company makes its estimate of its undiscounted liability for each site in light of the applicable remediation standards, experience with similar sites, the information it has available to it at the time 112 about the site and site-specific assumptions about such matters as the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods to be used.
For the cleanup of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants at the manufactured gas sites, estimates of the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants range from approximately $90million to $1.2billion. To develop these estimates, the assumption was made that there is contamination at the sites where investigation has not yet been started or completed. Additional assumptions were made as to the extent of contamination, the level of cleanup required and the type and extent of remediation that will be required. Actual experience may be materially different from these assumptions.
At December31, 2002, Con Edison had accrued $142.8million as its estimate of its undiscounted liability for Superfund Sites, including approximately $110million relating to manufactured gas sites. Most of the accrued liability relates to Superfund Sites where contamination has been detected and investigated in whole or in part. There will be additional liability relating to the Superfund Sites and other sites, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material to Con Edison's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In 2002, Con Edison's utility subsidiaries incurred $23.1million for environmental remediation costs, and received an insurance recovery of $7.2million related to Superfund Sites.
Con Edison's utility subsidiaries are permitted under current rate agreements to defer certain site investigation and remediation costs for subsequent recovery through rates. At December31, 2002, $83.1million of such costs had been deferred as a regulatory asset.
Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against Con Edison's utility subsidiaries and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the utility subsidiaries. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the utility subsidiaries, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to the company. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars but Con Edison believes that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through the disposition of previous claims. Based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment, Con Edison of New York's undiscounted potential liability over the next 50years is estimated to range between $37.7million and $162.1million for these suits and additional such suits that may be brought (with no amount within the range considered more reasonable than any other). At December31, 2002, Con Edison had accrued a $37.7million provision for these suits, and a like amount had been deferred as a regulatory asset in accordance with PSC authorization.
Workers' compensation administrative proceedings have been commenced, wherein current and former employees claim benefits based upon alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Based on the information and relevant circumstances known to Con Edison at this time, these claims are not expected to have 113 a material adverse effect on Con Edison's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. At December31, 2002, the company had accrued a $130.5million provision as its estimate of the utility subsidiaries' liability for workers' compensation claims, including those related to asbestos exposure. Of this amount $55.9million was deferred as a regulatory asset in accordance with PSC authorization.
In May2000, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation issued notices of violation to O&R and four other companies that have operated coal-fired electric generating facilities in New York State. The notices allege violations of the Federal Clean Air Act and the New York State Environmental Conservation Law resulting from the alleged failure to install pollution control equipment that would have reduced emissions of certain chemicals deemed potentially hazardous. The notice of violations received by O&R relates to the Lovett Generating Station that it sold in June1999. O&R is unable to predict whether or not alleged violations will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
NoteG - Nuclear Generation In September2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its nuclear generating facilities. See NoteI.
The PSC is investigating a February2000 to January2001 outage of the nuclear generating unit, its causes and the prudence of Con Edison of New York's actions regarding the operation and maintenance of the generating unit. The proceeding covers, among other things, Con Edison of New York's inspection practices, the circumstances surrounding prior outages, the basis for postponement of the unit's steam generator replacement and whether, and to what extent, increased replacement power costs and repair and replacement costs should be borne by Con Edison's shareholders.
Con Edison of New York has not billed to customers $90million of replacement power costs incurred during the outage. In addition, in 2000, Con Edison of New York accrued a $40million liability for the possible disallowance of replacement power costs that it had previously recovered from customers.
Con Edison of New York is unable to predict whether or not any proceedings, lawsuits, legislation or other actions relating to the nuclear generating unit will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
NoteH - Non-utility Generators Con Edison's utility subsidiaries have long-term contracts with non-utility generators (NUGs) for approximately 3,100 MW of electric generating capacity. Assuming performance by the NUGs, the utility subsidiaries are obligated over the terms of the contracts (which extend for various periods, up to 2036) to make capacity and other fixed payments.
For the years 2003 through 2007, the capacity and other fixed payments under the contracts are estimated to be $543million, $547million, $529million, $526million and $535million. Such payments gradually increase to approximately $600million in 2013, and thereafter decline significantly. For energy delivered under most of these contracts, the utility subsidiaries are obligated to pay variable prices that are estimated to be lower overall than expected market levels.
114 The NUG contracts include firm contracts for capacity (commitment ends 2005) and energy (commitment ends 2004) from the approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating unit that Con Edison of New York sold in 2001. For energy from the unit, Con Edison of New York is obligated to pay an average annual price of 3.9 cents per kWh. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned governmental authorities to shut down the nuclear generating unit. In the event that government authorities did not permit the unit to operate, the unit's owner would not be obligated to provide Con Edison of New York with power to replace the power the unit would have provided.
Under the terms of its electric rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is recovering in rates the charges it incurs under mandated contracts with NUGs. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that, following March31, 2005, Con Edison of New York will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers, the amount, if any, by which the actual costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market value. The PSC specifically approved rate recovery of the nuclear energy purchase.
O&R recovers its costs under the contracts pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
NoteI - Generation Divestiture Pursuant to restructuring agreements approved by the PSC (See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA), Con Edison of New York and O&R have divested all of their electric generating assets other than approximately 630 MW of Con Edison of New York's electric generating stations located in New York City. Con Edison of New York sold approximately 6,300 MW of electric generating assets in 1999 and approximately 1,480 MW in 2001. O&R completed the sale of all of its generating assets prior to the completion of Con Edison's purchase of O&R in 1999.
Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the net after-tax gain (including interest accrued thereon) from Con Edison of New York's 1999 generation divestiture was applied in 2000 as follows: $188.2million was credited against electric distribution plant balances; $107.3million was used to offset a like amount of regulatory assets (including deferred power contract termination costs); $50million (after tax) was deferred for recognition in income during the 12months ended March31, 2002; and $12million was deferred to be used for low-income customer programs. In addition, $30million of employee retirement incentive expenses related to the generation divestiture was deferred for amortization over 15years and $15million of such expenses was charged to income in 2000.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides for Con Edison of New York to amortize to income a $74million regulatory asset representing incremental electric capacity costs incurred prior to May2000 to purchase capacity from the buyers of the generating assets the company sold in 1999. Amortization to income will take place in years in which the company would otherwise share excess earnings with customers, in amounts corresponding to the company's share of the excess earnings. By March2005, any remaining unrecovered balance will be charged to expense. Of this amount, $30million was charged to expense in 2002 and $15million was expensed in 2001.
115 In January2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its 480 MW interest in the jointly-owned Roseton generating station for $138million. The net after-tax gain from the sale, which has been deferred as a regulatory liability, was $37.1million. In September2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating plant and related assets for $504.5million. The proceeds were net of a $73.8million payment to increase the value of the nuclear decommissioning trust funds being transferred to $430million (the amount provided for in the sales agreement). The net after-tax loss from the sale, which was deferred as a regulatory asset, was $174.8million at December31, 2001 and $127.2million at December31, 2002. Con Edison of New York was authorized, effective September2001, to continue to recover the cost of the deferred nuclear assets, which is included in rates, and to amortize the regulatory asset, until the loss on divestiture has been recovered. The 2000 Electric Agreement provides that Con Edison of New York "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments." NoteJ - Leases Con Edison's subsidiaries lease electric generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No.13, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.
Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered through rates. The following assets and obligations under capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) UTILITY PLANT Transmission $ 12.1 $ 13.5 Common 29.0 29.7 TOTAL $ 41.1 $ 43.2 CURRENT LIABILITIES $ 2.6 $ 2.1 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 38.5 41.1 TOTAL LIABILITIES $ 41.1 $ 43.2 The accumulated amortization of the capital leases was $28.8million and $26.8million as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
116 The future minimum lease commitments for the above assets are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $ 7.8 2004 7.5 2005 7.3 2006 7.2 2007 7.1 All years thereafter 35.1 Total $ 72.0 Less: amount representing interest 30.9 Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 41.1 In November2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with a limited partnership (Lessor) to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire (Newington Project). See NoteS.
Operating leases: The future minimum lease commitments under Con Edison's non-cancelable operating lease agreements, excluding the Newington Project, are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $ 45.6 2004 46.8 2005 15.5 2006 12.9 2007 8.6 All years thereafter 39.1 Total $ 168.5 As part of a broad initiative, the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing certain categories of transactions. Among these are transactions in which a taxpayer leases property and then immediately subleases it back to the lessor (termed "Lease In/Lease Out," or LILO transactions). In 1997 and 1999, Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries invested $93million in two LILO transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, which represented approximately 36percent of the purchase price; the remaining 64percent or $166million was furnished by third-party financing in the form of long-term debt that provides no recourse against the subsidiaries and is primarily secured by the assets, except for guarantees of up to $10million of the debt. Approximately half of these guarantees expired prior to December31, 2002 and the other half will expire at the end of May2004. At December31, 2002, the company's investment ($187million) in these leveraged leases net of deferred tax liabilities ($117million) amounted to $70million, which was included at cost on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet. On audit, the Internal Revenue Service has proposed that the tax losses recognized in connection with the 1997 LILO transaction be disallowed. Con Edison believes its position is correct and is currently appealing the auditors' proposal within the Internal Revenue Service. The estimated total tax savings from the two LILO transactions during the tax years 1997 through 2002, in the aggregate, was $82million.
117 NoteK - Goodwill and Intangible Assets On January1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No.142 provides that goodwill (i.e., the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of a business acquired) and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their finite useful lives. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill, determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination under SFAS No.141, "Business Combinations," to its carrying amount to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
Con Edison completed its initial goodwill impairment test and recorded a loss of $34.1million ($20.2million after-tax) as an offset to goodwill recorded in Con Edison's "Unregulated Subsidiaries and Other" business segment relating to certain generation assets owned by Con Edison Development. The fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. The impairment loss reflects changes in forecast market prices of energy and capacity and in risk-adjusted discount rates. The impairment loss is recognized net of taxes as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle at January1, 2002.
The change in the carrying amount of goodwill at December31, 2002 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Balance at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2002) $ 439.9 Impairment loss recognized (34.1 ) Balance at the end of the period (December 31, 2002) $ 405.8 Had Con Edison been accounting for goodwill under SFAS No.142 for all periods presented, its income and earnings per share would have been as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Net income for common stock As reported $ 646.0 $ 682.2 $ 582.8 Add back: goodwill amortization (net of tax) - 11.0 11.9 Adjusted $ 646.0 $ 693.2 $ 594.7 Basic earnings per share As reported $ 3.03 $ 3.22 $ 2.75 Add back: goodwill amortization (net of tax) - .05 .06 Adjusted $ 3.03 $ 3.27 $ 2.81 Diluted earnings per share As reported $ 3.02 $ 3.21 $ 2.74 Add back: goodwill amortization (net of tax) - .05 .06 Adjusted $ 3.02 $ 3.26 $ 2.80 118 In July1999, Con Edison acquired O&R and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Con Edison recorded in its consolidated financial statements goodwill in the amount of $437million and began the amortization of goodwill to income over a 40-year period. Upon adoption of SFAS No.142 in January2002, Con Edison discontinued the amortization of goodwill. The unamortized goodwill of $405.8 million was tested for impairment and determined not to be impaired.
Con Edison's finite life intangible asset relates to a power purchase agreement of an unregulated subsidiary and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over an approximately 25-year contract period. At December31, 2002, the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization were $91.7million and $9.7million, respectively. Amortization expense was $3.8million at December31, 2002 and is estimated to remain at $3.8million per year from 2003 to 2007.
NoteL - Income Tax The components of income tax are as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Charge/(benefit) to operations: State Current $ (2,876 ) $ 69,259 $ 28,941 Deferred - net 96,531 78,988 - Federal Current 93,469 380,509 103,670 Deferred - net 217,192 (57,089 ) 193,257 Amortization of investment tax credit (6,244 ) (7,135 ) (8,078 ) TOTAL CHARGE TO OPERATIONS 398,072 464,532 317,790 Charge/(benefit) to other income: State Current (2,819 ) (4,102 ) (5,304 ) Deferred - net (1,006 ) 73 - Federal Current (12,566 ) (8,684 ) (1,095 ) Deferred - net (1,162 ) (7,045 ) (3,892 ) Amortization of investment tax credit (4,127 ) (2,163 ) (331 ) TOTAL BENEFIT TO OTHER INCOME (21,680 ) (21,921 ) (10,622 ) TOTAL $ 376,392 $ 442,611 $ 307,168 119 The tax effect of temporary differences, which gave rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, is as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) Liabilities: Depreciation $ 1,556.2 $ 1,348.5 Regulatory Liability - Future Federal Income Tax 667.3 659.8 Other 542.4 414.3 TOTAL LIABILITIES 2,765.9 2,422.6 Assets: Other (190.3 ) (186.4 ) TOTAL ASSETS (190.3 ) (186.4 ) NET LIABILITY $ 2,575.6 $ 2,236.2 Reconciliation of the difference between income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the prevailing statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows: For the Years Ended December31, 2002 2001 2000 (% of Pre-tax income) STATUTORY TAX RATE Federal 35 % 35 % 35 % Changes in computed taxes resulting from: State income tax 6 9 2 Depreciation related differences 5 3 4 Cost of removal (5 ) (4 ) (6 ) Other (6 ) (4 ) (1 ) Effective Tax Rate 35 % 39 % 34 % NoteM - Stock-based Compensation Under Con Edison's Stock Option Plan (the Plan), options may be granted to officers and key employees of Con Edison and its subsidiaries for up to a total of 10million shares of Con Edison's common stock. Generally options become exercisable three years after the grant date and remain exercisable until 10years from the grant date.
As permitted by SFAS No.123, Con Edison elected to follow APB No.25 and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under the intrinsic value method of APB No.25, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of Con Edison's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Under the plan, exercise of Con Edison's employee stock options requires payment in full of the exercise price, unless the committee of Con Edison's Board of Directors that administers the Plan determines that options may be settled by paying to the option holder the difference between the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and the exercise price (cash settlement). In 2002, to ensure that the exercise of currently exercisable options would comply with certain technical requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to certain officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries, the 120 committee determined that 1996 and 1997 stock options covering 295,500 shares of common stock held by those officers may be settled by the cash settlement method. A $3.8million charge to expense was recognized for Con Edison in 2002 for these options. Additional changes to expense will be recognized with respect to these options to the extent the fair market value of the common shares changes in future periods.
Disclosure of pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No.123 and SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosures." See "Stock-Based Compensation" in NoteA for an illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to its stock-based employee compensation. The fair values of 2002, 2001 and 2000 options are $6.37, $5.23 and $4.42 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Risk-free interest rate 5.08% 5.22% 6.25% Expected lives - in years 6 8 8 Expected stock volatility 21.43% 21.32% 20.51% Dividend yield 5.22% 5.83% 6.60% A summary of changes in the status of stock options awarded to officers and employees of Con Edison as of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows: Shares Weighted Average Price Outstanding at 12/31/99 3,556,210 $ 39.607 Granted 1,349,500 32.499 Exercised (68,697 ) 29.732 Forfeited (46,100 ) 39.231 Outstanding at 12/31/00 4,790,913 37.749 Granted 1,487,050 37.758 Exercised (363,013 ) 29.740 Forfeited (160,300 ) 41.333 Outstanding at 12/31/01 5,754,650 38.157 Granted 1,584,350 42.510 Exercised (413,899 ) 30.813 Forfeited (127,450 ) 44.103 Outstanding at 12/31/02 6,797,651 $ 39.506 121 The following summarizes the Plan's stock options outstanding at December31, 2002 for each plan year: Plan Year Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Outstanding At 12/31/02 Remaining Contractual Life 2002 $ 42.510 1,581,850 9 years 2001 37.758 1,474,050 8 years 2000 32.499 1,283,750 7 years 1999 47.876 1,149,900 6 years 1998 42.609 747,450 5 years 1997 31.500 395,526 4 years 1996 27.875 165,125 3 years As of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 there were vested options outstanding to purchase 1,308,101, 939,850 and 1,304,863 shares of common stock, respectively, at an exercise price below the closing market price on that day. The weighted average exercise prices were $37.36, $30.11 and $31.50, respectively.
As of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 the total number of vested options outstanding were 2,458,001, 1,765,200 and 1,304,863 with weighted average exercise prices of $42.28, $35.95 and $31.50, respectively.
Pursuant to employment agreements, effective September2000, certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries were granted an aggregate of 350,000 restricted stock units, subject to the officers meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. In June2002, an additional 150,000 restricted stock units were granted to certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries under similar terms. The units, each of which represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock and related dividends, vest ratably through August2005 or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for the units over the vesting period. The expense recognized for restricted stock during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $4.4million, $3.1million and $0.9million, respectively.
In June2002, Con Edison terminated its Directors' Retirement Plan applicable to non-officer directors (the termination is not applicable to directors who had previously retired from the board) and adopted a deferred stock compensation plan for these directors. Under the plan, directors were granted stock units for accrued service. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison recognizes compensation expense and accrues a liability for the units. An expense of $2.4million was recorded in 2002.
NoteN - Financial Information By Business Segment Con Edison's business segments were determined based on similarities in economic characteristics, the regulatory environment, and management's reporting requirements. Con Edison's principal business segments are:  Regulated Electric-consists of regulated activities of Con Edison of New York and O&R relating to the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
122  Regulated Gas - consists of regulated activities of Con Edison of New York and O&R relating to the transportation, storage, distribution and sale of natural gas in New York and Pennsylvania.
Regulated Steam - consists of regulated activities of Con Edison of New York relating to the generation, distribution and sale of steam in New York.
Unregulated Subsidiaries - represents the operations of the subsidiaries that participate in the competitive electric and gas supply, energy infrastructure, energy-related products and services and telecommunications businesses.
Other - includes the operations of the parent company, Con Edison, and consolidation adjustments.
All revenues of Con Edison's business segments, excluding revenues earned by Con Edison Development on certain energy infrastructure projects, which are deemed to be immaterial, are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of its business segments, excluding certain investments in energy infrastructure projects by Con Edison Development, are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. See NoteA.
Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.
The financial data for business segments are as follows: Regulated Electric 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 6,250,896 $ 6,887,863 $ 6,938,128 Intersegment revenues 9,612 12,589 53,514 Depreciation and amortization 377,462 407,992 477,352 Income tax expense 317,960 382,153 239,772 Operating income 816,733 902,176 808,960 Interest charge 326,790 316,449 309,753 Changes in accounting principles - - - Total assets 13,308,802 12,193,525 12,386,304 Construction expenditures 870,590 810,821 786,211 123 Regulated Gas 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 1,204,033 $ 1,465,956 $ 1,261,970 Intersegment revenues 2,874 3,181 6,113 Depreciation and amortization 76,106 72,050 66,780 Income tax expense 65,946 73,768 64,942 Operating income 173,317 179,823 176,171 Interest charge 71,262 72,068 66,498 Changes in accounting principles - - - Total assets 2,902,813 2,711,008 2,607,624 Construction expenditures 200,981 169,739 140,702 Regulated Steam 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 404,044 $ 503,736 $ 452,135 Intersegment revenues 1,810 1,903 2,023 Depreciation and amortization 18,330 17,902 18,173 Income tax expense (4,832 ) 5,695 2,407 Operating income 36,046 27,893 25,557 Interest charge 21,950 20,768 18,191 Changes in accounting principles - - - Total assets 977,315 746,587 686,807 Construction expenditures 82,887 64,308 32,014 Unregulated Subsidiaries 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 647,279 $ 540,577 $ 679,573 Intersegment revenues - - - Depreciation and amortization 22,615 17,356 13,547 Income tax expense 18,998 2,916 10,669 Operating income 33,051 29,675 18,024 Interest charge 15,556 16,863 9,652 Changes in accounting principles 22,061 - - Total assets 1,321,519 1,020,602 820,942 Construction expenditures 213,457 163,921 121,214 124 Other 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ (24,392 ) $ (9,333 ) $ (14,582 ) Intersegment revenues 24,392 9,333 14,582 Depreciation and amortization 40 10,821 10,555 Income tax expense - - - Operating income 990 (12,009 ) (12,576 ) Interest charge 6,024 4,732 3,351 Changes in accounting principles - - - Total assets 309,861 362,733 265,568 Construction expenditures - - - Total 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 8,481,860 $ 9,388,799 $ 9,317,224 Intersegment revenues 38,688 27,006 76,232 Depreciation and amortization 494,553 526,121 586,407 Income tax expense 398,072 464,532 317,790 Operating income 1,060,137 1,127,558 1,016,136 Interest charge 441,582 430,880 407,445 Changes in accounting principles 22,061 - - Total assets 18,820,310 17,034,455 16,767,245 Construction expenditures 1,367,915 1,208,789 1,080,141 NoteO - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Effective January2001, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended (SFAS No.133). Upon adoption, Con Edison's subsidiaries recognized after-tax transition gains of $1.7million in other comprehensive income (OCI) and $0.4million in current income.
Energy Price Hedging Con Edison's subsidiaries use derivative instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase or sale of electricity and gas (hedges). As of December31, 2002, the fair value of the derivatives for such use was $38.8million, comprised of $16.9million at the regulated utility subsidiaries and $21.9million at the unregulated subsidiaries.
Con Edison's regulated utility subsidiaries, pursuant to SFAS No.71, defer recognition in income of gains and losses on hedges until the underlying transactions are completed. In accordance with rate provisions that permit the recovery of the cost of purchased power and gas for resale, Con Edison's regulated utility subsidiaries credit or charge to their customer's gains or losses on hedges and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA.
For Con Edison of New York, the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that 10percent of gains or losses on hedges flow to net income as rewards or penalties. Con Edison of New York has elected cash flow hedge accounting under SFAS No.133 for a qualifying portion of its electric hedges. Con Edison 125 Solutions, which provides competitive gas and electric supply and energy-related products and services, has also elected cash flow hedge accounting.
Pursuant to cash flow hedge accounting, except as described below, the mark-to-market unrealized gain or loss on each hedge is recorded in OCI and reclassified to income at the time the underlying transaction is completed.
Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for energy transactions, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges due to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of $0 and $1.2 taxes $ - $ 1.7 Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges, net of $19.1 and ($18.8) taxes 27.5 (26.8 ) Less: Reclassification adjustment for gains/(losses) included in net income, net of $1.1 and ($8.6) taxes 1.6 (12.4 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges for the period $ 25.9 ($ 12.7 ) As of December31, 2002, the cash flow hedges had a remaining term of less than two years and $13.2million of existing after-tax net gains relating to these hedges are expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to income within the next 12months.
Under cash flow hedge accounting, any gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be "ineffective" is recognized in income in the period in which such determination is made. As a result, changes in value of a hedge may be recognized in income in an earlier period than the period in which the underlying transaction is recognized in income. Con Edison recognized in income mark-to-market unrealized pre-tax net gains of $6.2million in 2002 and $6.2million of pre-tax net losses in 2001 relating to hedge ineffectiveness at Con Edison Solutions.
Interest Rate Hedging Con Edison's subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposures associated with debt. In October2002, Con Edison of New York entered into a swap agreement in connection with its $224.6million tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series2001A. Pursuant to the swap agreement provisions, Con Edison of New York pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375percent. The agreement has a term of 10years and is callable at par after three years. The swap is designated as a fair value hedge and qualifies for "short-cut" hedge accounting under SFAS No.133. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the swap instrument are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings. As of December31, 2002, the fair value of the interest rate swap was $7.7million and recorded as an asset and the fair value of the hedged bonds was $232.3million.
O&R and Con Edison Development use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of their variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. The swap agreements, displayed in the table below, are designated as cash flow 126 hedges under SFAS No.133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. At December31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of the O&R interest rate swap was a loss of $19.1million and $14.2million, respectively, and the fair value of the Con Edison Development interest rate swap was a loss of $9.7million and $5.7million, respectively.
The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges are as follows: Debt Maturity Date of Swaps Notional Amount ($000) Fixed Rate Paid Variable Rate Received Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bond, 1994 Series A 2014 55,000 6.09 % Current bond rate Variable rate loans - Lakewood 2008 77,500 6.68 % LIBOR Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for interest rate swaps, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges due to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of $0 and ($6.8) taxes $ - ($ 9.7 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges, net of ($6.4) and ($3.1) taxes (9.1 ) (4.4 ) Less: Reclassification adjustment for gains/(losses) included in net income, net of ($2.8) and ($1.7) taxes (3.9 ) (2.4 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges for the period ($ 5.2 ) ($ 11.7 ) As of December31, 2002, $3.5million of existing after-tax losses relating to the interest rate swap agreements are expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to income within the next 12months.
Energy Trading Activities Unregulated subsidiaries of Con Edison engage in energy trading activities that are accounted for at fair value. Con Edison Energy utilizes commodity contracts such as two-party forward contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity and capacity, over-the-counter swap contracts, exchange-traded natural gas and crude oil futures and options, transmission congestion contracts, natural gas transportation contracts, and other physical and financial contracts.
Prior to October1, 2002, these contracts were accounted for under FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As of October1, 2002, energy and energy-related trading contracts that meet the definition of derivatives are accounted for under SFAS No.133. Such contracts are marked to market, with gains and losses recognized in earnings. For the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, Con Edison recognized in income net unrealized pre-tax losses of $1.4million, excluding the effect of a cumulative adjustment due to a change in accounting principle, and net gains of $9.6million, respectively. Contracts that did not fall within the scope of SFAS No.133 were included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See NoteT for further discussion.
127 The fair value of energy trading net assets as of December31, 2002 and 2001 was $4.9million and $11.2million, respectively.
NoteP - Northeast Utilities In March2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entitled Consolidated Edison,Inc. v. Northeast Utilities, seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edison's obligation to complete its acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January11, 2000 (the merger agreement). In May2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As amended, Con Edison's complaint seeks, among other things, recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, the court's declaration that under the merger agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to Northeast Utilities and that Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison.
In June2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim to Con Edison's amended complaint its claim that Con Edison materially breached the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the consideration to be paid to Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock, expenditures in connection with regulatory approvals and lost business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $26.00 per share (an estimated aggregate of not more than $3.9billion) plus $0.0034 per share for each day after August5, 2000 through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50percent in cash and 50percent in stock.
Con Edison believes that Northeast Utilities has materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con Edison has not materially breached the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it is not obligated to acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities does not meet the merger agreement's conditions that Northeast Utilities perform all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Those obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement were true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect to Northeast Utilities.
Both parties have filed motions for summary judgment. Con Edison is unable to predict whether or not any Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edison's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
NoteQ - World Trade Center Attack Con Edison of New York estimates that it will incur $430million of costs for emergency response, temporary restoration and permanent replacement of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged as a result of the September11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Most of 128 the costs are expected to be capital in nature. The company estimates that $96million of the costs will be covered by insurance. In December2001, Con Edison of New York filed a petition with the PSC for authorization to defer these costs, which the company expects the PSC to permit it to recover from customers, net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payment and tax savings. In August2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds, for which the company is eligible to apply, to recover costs it incurred in connection with the attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. At December31, 2002, the company had capitalized $134million of such costs as utility plant and deferred $63million of such costs as a regulatory asset. In addition, at December31, 2001, the company accrued a regulatory liability to defer recognition in income of an $81.5million tax refund claim resulting from a casualty loss deduction taken by the company relating to the attack.
NoteR - Guarantees In November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees, a guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability. FIN 45 contains exclusions to this requirement, including the exclusion of a parent's guarantee of its subsidiaries' debt to a third party. FIN 45 is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002.
Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has issued guarantees on behalf of entities in which it has an equity interest. Con Edison's guarantees had maximum limits totaling $1.1billion at December31, 2002 and 2001, of which $588.2million and $456.2million, respectively, were outstanding. Management believes the likelihood that Con Edison would be required to perform with respect to these guarantees is remote. The adoption of FIN 45 is not expected to have a material impact on Con Edison's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The following table summarizes, by type and term, the total maximum amount of guarantees: Maximum Amount Guarantee Type 0-3 years 4-10 years 10 years Total (Thousands of Dollars) Commodity Transactions $ 611,464 $ 31,000 $ 17,487 $ 659,951 Newington Lease Agreement - - 353,333 353,333 Affordable Housing Program - 56,682 - 56,682 Lease Obligations 1,412 1,375 24,358 27,145 Other Guarantees 5,170 10,392 2,698 18,260 TOTAL $ 618,046 $ 99,449 $ 397,876 $ 1,115,371 Commodity Transactions Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that 129 liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Newington Lease Agreement Con Edison guarantees the payment and performance obligations of a Con Edison Development subsidiary. See NoteS.
Affordable Housing Program Con Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with respect to the debt ($56.7million, including interest) relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue No.94-01, "Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects," neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet.
Lease Obligations Con Edison guarantees certain rent payment obligations of its subsidiaries under various property lease agreements for office buildings. Of the maximum guarantee amount, $15.0million relates to a guarantee given to Con Edison of New York.
Other Con Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following:  $15.1million of guarantees for standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration projects  $2.7million of guarantees for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities  $0.4million of letters of credit from financial institutions primarily for security deposits NoteS - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46), which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE's) by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE. The consolidation requirements apply immediately to VIE's created after January31, 2003. For VIE's created earlier, the consolidation requirements apply in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the VIE was established. Con Edison has identified the Newington Project, which is described in the following paragraphs, as a VIE that will require consolidation upon adoption of FIN 46. In addition, Con Edison is evaluating certain other investments to determine if they require consolidation or disclosure upon adoption of FIN 46. These include two LILO transactions that are accounted for as leveraged leases under SFAS No.13 (see NoteJ), an investment in the Affordable Housing Program (see NoteR), and three investments in power and cogeneration plants with assets of $82.9million and debt of $42.5million that are accounted for under the equity method. Con Edison is in the process of 130 completing its evaluation but does not expect the results to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
In November2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with Hawkeye L.P. (Lessor) to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire. In accordance with SFAS No.13, and related EITF issues (including EITF Issue No.90-15, "Impact of Non-substantive Lessors, Residual Value Guarantees, and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions" and EITF Issue No.97-10, "The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction"), the Newington Project and the related obligations are not included on Con Edison's consolidated balance sheet.
At the expiration of the initial lease term in June2010, the subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the project for the then outstanding amounts expended by the Lessor for the project. In the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the project, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value of the Newington Project for an amount not to exceed $239.7million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the Lessor if an event of default should occur during either the construction period or the lease period. If the subsidiary were to default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the Lessor's investment in the Newington Project, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value guarantee. At December31, 2002, projected project costs were $353million. The subsidiary's payment and performance obligations relating to the Newington Project are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison. See NoteR.
Future minimum rental payments under the Newington Project operating lease are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $ 33.3 2004 33.3 2005 33.3 2006 33.3 2007 33.3 All years thereafter 83.2 Total $ 249.7 Upon adoption of FIN 46, Con Edison will be required to include the Newington Project assets and the related debt on its consolidated balance sheet. Con Edison estimates that this will result in a decrease in annual after tax net income of $3.8million and increases of $353million in non-utility plant and long-term debt and other liabilities. Con Edison expects that its maximum exposure to loss would equal the total assets of the project.
Substantial completion on the Newington project occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The subsidiary and the construction contractor for this plant have initiated legal proceedings with respect to whether the subsidiary is entitled to damages for a delay in completion of this plant and whether the contractor is entitled to additional project costs. Con Edison does not expect that this dispute will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
131 NoteT - New Financial Accounting Standards During 2002, the FASB issued four new accounting standards: SFAS No.145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.13, and Technical Corrections," SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," SFAS No.147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions," and SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The FASB also issued Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," in November2002, and Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," in January2003. In addition, during 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on several issues within EITF Issue No.02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," one of which was the rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." SFAS No.145 rescinds SFAS No.4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," and SFAS No.64, "Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements," effective January1, 2003. This statement also amends SFAS No.13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have an economic impact similar to sale-leaseback transactions and amends certain other authoritative pronouncements, effective May15, 2002. SFAS No.146, which was effective January1, 2003, requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No.147, which was effective October1, 2002, provides guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of a financial institution. SFAS No.148, which amends SFAS No.123, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No.148 amends the financial statements disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123 regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effects of the method used on reported results. Finally, this statement amends APB No.28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The amendment of SFAS No.123 is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. The amendment of Opinion No.28 is effective for interim periods beginning after December15, 2002. For information about the company's stock-based compensation, see NoteM.
The adoption of these statements had no impact on Con Edison's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
See NoteR for a discussion on FIN 45 and NoteS for a discussion on FIN 46.
In June2002, the EITF reached a partial consensus on EITF Issue No.02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," which provides that revenue resulting from energy trading contracts, whether realized or unrealized and whether financially or physically settled, should be shown net in the income statement. This ruling became effective for periods ending after July2002, with reclassification of prior period amounts required. Beginning in the third quarter of 2002, Con Edison is 132 presenting all mark-to-market, realized and unrealized, gains and losses on a net basis. Upon the application of the consensus, comparative financial statements for prior periods were reclassified to conform to the consensus. As a result, Con Edison's non-utility revenues and energy costs were reduced by $245million in 2001 and $114million in 2000.
On October25, 2002, the EITF reached a consensus to rescind EITF Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As a result, new energy trading and energy-related contracts entered into after October25, 2002, that do not qualify as derivatives under SFAS No.133 are not marked to market. All derivative contracts will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133. Therefore, previously recognized mark-to-market gains and losses on non-derivative contracts must be reversed upon adoption of this consensus. The effective date for the full rescission of EITF 98-10 was January1, 2003, with early application permitted. Con Edison adopted this consensus effective on October1, 2002 and reported the effect of the transition as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the after-tax loss amount of $1.9million.
In October2002, the EITF reached a consensus that gains and losses, realized and unrealized, on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No.133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. This consensus was effective January1, 2003, with early adoption permitted. Con Edison chose to adopt this consensus effective October1, 2002. The adoption of the consensus had no impact on Con Edison's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Additional disclosures regarding energy trading activities required by EITF Issue No.02-3 in June2002 were eliminated in October2002, with the rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10.
The EITF did not reach consensus on whether or not recognition of unrealized gains and losses at inception of an energy-trading contract is appropriate. However, the FASB staff observed that unrealized gains or losses at inception should not be recognized unless the fair value of the derivative instrument is evidenced by a quoted market price, similar current market transactions or valuations based on observable market information. For the year ended December31, 2002, Con Edison's unregulated subsidiaries recognized in income $10.9million related to unrealized gains at inception of contracts. There were no such amounts in 2001.
Con Edison has also adopted the following accounting standards that were issued in 2001.
On January1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." See NoteK.
On January1, 2003 Con Edison adopted SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity will capitalize the cost by increasing the amount of the related asset. The liability will be increased to its present value each period and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement of the asset, the entity will settle the obligation for the amount recorded or incur a gain or loss.
133 The adoption of SFAS No.143 did not have a material impact on Con Edison's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which Con Edison adopted on January1, 2002, replaces SFAS No.121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS No.144 requires that all long-lived assets held for sale or meeting other specified criteria be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. SFAS No.144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS No.144 had no impact on Con Edison's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

NoteA - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Con Edison of New York and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For regulated public utilities, like Con Edison of New York, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America include the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," and, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC).
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
The Company's principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the PSC.
143 The standards in SFAS No.101, "Regulated EnterprisesAccounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement No.71," have been applied to the Company's electric supply business, including electric generating assets (see NoteI) and non-utility generator (NUG) contracts (see NoteH) and related regulatory assets and liabilities, following the 1997 Restructuring Agreement (defined below). The application of SFAS No.101 to the electric supply business had no material effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
Other significant accounting policies of the Company are referenced in NoteD (Pension Benefits), NoteE (Other Postretirement Benefits), NoteN (Leases) and NoteO (Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities) to the financial statements.
Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric In September1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties (the 1997 Restructuring Agreement). The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended March31, 2002, a reasonable opportunity for recovery of "strandable costs" and the divestiture of electric generation capacity by the Company.
At December31, 2002, approximately 163,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing approximately 25percent of aggregate customer load were purchasing electricity from other suppliers under the electric retail access program (which is available to all of the Company's electric customers). The Company delivers electricity to customers in this program through its regulated transmission and distribution systems. In general, the Company's delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable Con Edison of New York customers, less an amount reflecting costs otherwise associated with supplying customers with energy and capacity.
Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, the Company reduced electric rates, on an annual basis, by $129million in 1998, $80million in April1999, $103million in April2000 and $209million in April2001. The effect of the April2001 decrease for the rate year ended March31, 2002 was partially offset by recognition in income of $36million relating to rates for distributing electricity to customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) and $50million (after tax) of deferred generation divestiture gain. Rates were also reduced, on an annual basis, effective September2001 by $313million to reflect the divestiture of the nuclear generating facility and the Roseton generating plant, which resulted in a reduction in operating and other expenses. See NoteI.
Pursuant to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, as amended by a July1998 PSC order, the Company sold approximately 7,790 MW of the approximately 8,300 MW of generating capacity that it owned at the time the 1997 Restructuring Agreement was executed. See NoteI.
In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement (the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement) that revises and extends the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the Company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000.
144 In general, under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the Company's base electric transmission and distribution rates will not otherwise be changed during the five-year period ending March2005 except (i)with respect to certain changes in costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements, inflation in excess of a 4percent annual rate, property tax changes and environmental cost increases or (ii)if the PSC determines that circumstances have occurred that either threaten the Company's economic viability or ability to provide, safe and adequate service, or render the Company's rate of return unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service.
Under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December2001, 35percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March2002 through 2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity will be retained for shareholders and the balance will be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. As of December31, 2002, the Company established an electric shared earnings reserve of $40million for the rate year ending March2003. There was no sharing of earnings for the rate years ended March2002 and 2001. The earnings threshold for rate years ending March2003 through March2005 of 11.75percent can be increased up to 50 basis points. The threshold will increase by 25 basis points if certain demand reductions and supply increases exceed targeted projections and by an additional 25 basis points if certain customer service and reliability objectives are achieved. The Company could be required to pay up to $40million annually in penalties if certain threshold service and reliability objectives are not achieved.
Con Edison of New York's potential electric strandable costs are utility investments and commitments that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market. The Company is recovering these costs in the rates it charges all of its electric customers. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the stranded cost recovery provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, stating that the Company "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments, under the parameters and during the time periods set forth therein." The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continues the rate provisions pursuant to which the Company recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" below.
Gas In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the 1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000.
Under the 2000 agreement, the rate of return on gas common equity above which the Company shared with customers, 50percent of earnings was increased from 13percent to 14percent. In addition, customer bills were reduced by $20million during the January through March2001 period.
145 At December31, 2001, the Company reserved $11.5million for customers' share of gas earnings in excess of the 14percent threshold for the rate year ended September2001. No additional amounts were reserved for the rate year ended September2002.
In April2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduces gas rates, on an annualized basis, by $25million.
During the term of the 2002 agreement, the Company retains 100percent of the rate year return on equity up to 11.5percent. If the return on equity is between 11.5percent and 12.0percent then 100percent of the incremental return over 11.5percent will be set aside for customer benefit. If the return on equity is above 12.0percent, then 50percent of the incremental return over 12.0percent will be retained by shareholders, and the remaining 50percent will be shared with customers.
The 2002 agreement also continued the retail access credit for firm transportation customers and other programs designed to increase customer and marketer participation in the gas retail access program, the net costs of which are deferred for future recovery from customers.
Under the 2002 agreement, in May2002, the Company established a $36.4million reserve, funded by previously deferred customer credits, to recover unreimbursed costs directly related to the World Trade Center attack.
Steam In December2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that provided for a $16.6million steam rate increase in October2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004. The Company is required to share with customers 50percent of any earnings for any rate year covered by the agreement above of a specified rate of return on steam common equity (11.0percent for the first rate year, the 12-month period ended September2001; 10.5percent thereafter if the repowering of the Company's East River steam-electric generating plant is not completed). The net revenue effect associated with sales increases related to colder than normal winter weather (November through April) will be excluded from any earnings measurement. Earnings on steam common equity did not exceed the specific rates of return for the rate years ended September30, 2001 and 2002.
Under the steam rate agreement, upon completion of the project to add incremental generating capacity at the Company's East River steam-electric generating plant, the net benefits of the project (including the net after-tax gain from the sale of a nine-acre development site in mid-town Manhattan along the East River) allocable to steam operations will inure to the benefit of steam customers.
The agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased steam and fuel costs and requires the Company to develop a strategy for hedging price variations for a portion of the steam produced each year.
146 Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property, together with removal cost, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on the Company's own funds when so used, determined in accordance with PSC and FERC regulations. The AFDC rate was 6.8percent in 2002, 6.8percent in 2001 and 7.2percent in 2000. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds were treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities' own funds were credited to other income (deductions).
The Company generally computes annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on appropriate average service lives and net salvage factors. The Company's depreciation rates averaged 3.0percent in 2002, 3.1percent in 2001 and 3.7percent in 2000. The estimated lives for utility plant range from 30 to 80years for electric, 15 to 75years for gas, 30 to 75years for steam and 8 to 50years for general plant.
Non-utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost and consists primarily of land and telecommunication facilities that are not currently utilized within utility operations.
Revenues Con Edison of New York recognizes revenues for electric, gas and steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. In accordance with regulatory agreements, the Company does not accrue unbilled revenues.
Recoverable Energy Costs Con Edison of New York generally recovers all of its prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with PSC-approved rate provisions, which also include a $25million annual incentive or penalty relating to electric costs (see "Energy Price Hedging" in Note O). If the actual energy costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed energy costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). The Company defers all net interruptible gas revenues, not authorized by the PSC to be retained by the Company, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers.
The difference between amounts for purchased power initially billed to the Company by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) and amounts subsequently determined by the NYISO to have actually been supplied by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Company, or paid to the NYISO by the Company. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the 147 Company's customers. At December31, 2002, $106.9million of refunds received from the NYISO were deferred as a regulatory liability.
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Company considers temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Investments Investments are recorded on the equity method.
Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the Company has recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Company has recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability it will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or "turn-around" of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No.71, regulatory assets have been established for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense (see NoteJ). In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No.109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction in future federal income tax expense.
Con Edison of New York files a federal income tax return on a consolidated basis with Con Edison and its other subsidiaries. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays tax or receives a benefit based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.
State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed effective January1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to the tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and the tax expense resulting from the tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated in base rates.
Con Edison of New York files a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return on a consolidated basis with Con Edison and its other subsidiaries. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives a benefit based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
148 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The PSC requires the Company to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is part of the PSC approved revenue requirement within each of the respective rate agreements.
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs relating to specific construction projects are capitalized. All other such costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000 amounting to $11.0million, $13.8million and $14.0million, respectively, were charged to operating expenses. No research and development costs were capitalized in these years.
Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Stock-Based Compensation Con Edison of New York applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. See NoteK. The following table illustrates the effect on net income if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to stock-based employee compensation.
For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Net income, as reported $ 605 $ 649 $ 570 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 6 3 1 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of related tax effects (12 ) (6 ) (5 ) Pro forma net income $ 599 $ 646 $ 566 These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures due to changes in future market conditions and additional grants in future years.
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NoteB - Capitalization Common Stock At December31, 2002 and 2001, Con Edison owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock ($2.50 par value) of Con Edison of New York. Con Edison of New York owns $962.1million of 149 Con Edison stock, which it purchased in 1998 and 1999 in connection with Con Edison's stock repurchase plan.
Preferred Stock Con Edison of New York has outstanding 1,915,319 shares of its $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "$5 Preferred") and 375,626 shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock ($100 par value) at December31, 2002 and 2001.
Dividends on the $5 Preferred stock are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $4.65 per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred dividends must be declared by Con Edison of New York's Board of Trustees to become payable. See "Dividends" below.
With respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison of New York has outstanding, 235,488,094 shares of its common stock, and the holders of the $5 Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock have no right to vote; provided, however, that, if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share with respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods the holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the election of Con Edison of New York's Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Company may not create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. The Company may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $101 per share (in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends). In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the Company's common stock, the holders of the $5 Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled to receive $100 per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case together with all accrued and unpaid dividends.
Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that Con Edison of New York may pay are limited to not more than 100percent of its income available for dividends, calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of "income available for dividends" are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing Con Edison of New York's equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.
150 In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New York's common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.
Long-Term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2003-2007 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $ 425 * 2004 150 2005 450 2006 - 2007 330 * Includes redemption in advance of maturity of $275million of the Company's Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures Series1996A in January2003.
Long-term debt is principally stated at cost, which, as of December31, 2002, approximates fair value (estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities), except for $224.6million of the Company's tax-exempt financing. See "Interest Rate Hedging" in NoteO.
Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions, under the financing arrangements for the debentures of the Company. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Company are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Company to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. Certain series of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing (Series1993A, B and C, Series1994A and Series1995A), aggregating $476.8million, each contain as events of default a default in the payment of the other series and events of default under the Company's mortgage trust indenture (which has been satisfied and discharged). The arrangements for the other series of Con Edison of New York's tax-exempt financing (Series1999A, 2001A and 2001B), aggregating $615.3million, include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default occurred, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied may, and in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.
151 The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the Company does not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the Company shall not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels ($100million for Con Edison of New York).
NoteC - Short Term Borrowing At December31, 2002, the Company had a $500million commercial paper program under which short-term borrowings are made at prevailing market rates. The program is supported by a revolving credit agreement with banks. At December31, 2002, there was no commercial paper outstanding under the program. The Company changes the amount of its program from time to time, subject to a $1billion FERC-authorized limit.
Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreement were renewed in November2002. The commitments may terminate upon a change of control of Con Edison or Con Edison of New York, and borrowings under the agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio (calculated in accordance with the agreements) of debt to total capital of the borrower not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1. At December31, 2002, this ratio was 0.53 to 1 for the Company. Borrowings under the agreements are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels. The fees charged for the revolving credit agreement and borrowing under the agreement reflect the Company's credit rating.
NoteD - Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees and retirees of Con Edison of New York. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period. This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," which provides a "corridor method" for moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
152 The components of the Company's net periodic benefit costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Service cost - including administrative expenses $ 87.5 $ 89.0 $ 85.1 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 412.5 398.2 383.3 Expected return on plan assets (660.7 ) (632.6 ) (543.6 ) Amortization of net actuarial (gain) (179.0 ) (198.4 ) (189.7 ) Amortization of prior service cost 13.7 13.2 10.5 Amortization of transition (asset)/obligation (0.6 ) 3.0 3.0 NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST (326.6 ) (327.6 ) (251.4 ) Amortization of regulatory asset* 4.2 4.2 17.7 TOTAL PERIODIC BENEFIT COST $ (322.4 ) $ (323.4 ) $ (233.7 ) Cost capitalized (64.2 ) (72.0 ) (49.1 ) Cost charged to operating expenses (258.2 ) (251.4 ) (184.6 ) * Relates to increases in pension obligations of $33.3million from a 1993 special retirement program and $45million from a 1999 special retirement program.

The Company made contributions to the plan of $15.8million, $15.7million and $15.6million for years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
NoteE - Other Postretirement Benefits Con Edison of New York has a contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug program for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses. The Company also has a contributory life insurance program for bargaining unit employees. In addition, the Company provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees.
Certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries are eligible to receive benefits under these programs. Con Edison of New York has reserved the right to amend or terminate these programs.
Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.

The actuarial assumptions at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Discount Rate 6.75 % 7.50 % 7.75 % EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS Tax-exempt assets 9.20 % 9.20 % 8.50 % Taxable assets 8.20 % 8.20 % 7.50 % The health care cost trend rate assumed for 2003 is 9.0percent. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75percent for 2009 and remain at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: 1-Percentage-Point Increase 1-Percentage-Point Decrease (Millions of Dollars) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 116.3 $ (103.8 ) Effect on service cost and interest cost components $ 10.6 $ (9.3 ) 155 NoteF - Environmental Matters Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Company and are present in its facilities and equipment currently or previously owned.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) and similar state statutes impose joint and several strict liabilities, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for resulting removal and remediation costs and environmental damages. Liabilities under these laws can be material and in some instances may be imposed without regard to fault, or may be imposed for past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred.
The environmental remediation costs for the sites at which Con Edison of New York has been asserted to have liability for remediation under Superfund or similar state statutes, including its manufactured gas sites, (Superfund Sites) include investigation, demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring costs. For sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Company is not managing the site investigation and remediation, the liability accrued represents the Company's estimate of what it will need to pay to settle its obligations with respect to the site. For other sites, the liability accrued represents the Company's estimate of its investigation and remediation costs for the site. In either case, the Company makes its estimate of its undiscounted liability for each site in light of the applicable remediation standards, experience with similar sites, the information it has available to it at the time about the site and site-specific assumptions about such matters as the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods to be used.
For the cleanup of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants at the manufactured gas sites, estimates of the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants range from approximately $65million to $1.1billion. To develop these estimates, the assumption was made that there is contamination at the sites where investigation has not yet been started or completed. Additional assumptions were made as to the extent of contamination, the level of cleanup required and the type and extent of remediation that will be required. Actual experience may be materially different from these assumptions.
At December31, 2002, the Company had accrued $107.5million as its estimate of its undiscounted liability for Superfund Sites, including approximately $76million relating to manufactured gas sites. Most of the accrued liability relates to Superfund Sites where contamination has been detected and investigated in whole or in part. There will be additional liability relating to the Superfund Sites and other sites, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material to Con Edison of New York's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
In 2002, the Company incurred $21.6million for environmental remediation costs, and received no insurance recoveries related to Superfund Sites.
156 Under the Company's current electric, gas and steam rate agreements site investigation and remediation costs in excess of $5million annually incurred with respect to hazardous waste for which it is responsible are to be deferred and subsequently reflected in rates. At December31, 2002, $52.3million of such costs had been deferred as a regulatory asset.
Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against Con Edison of New York and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Company. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by Con Edison of New York, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to the Company. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars. However, the Company believes that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through the disposition of previous claims. Based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment, the Company's undiscounted potential liability over the next 50years is estimated to range between $37.7million and $162.1million for these suits and additional such suits that may be brought (with no amount within the range considered more reasonable than any other). At December31, 2002, the Company had accrued a $37.7million provision for these suits, and a like amount had been deferred as a regulatory asset in accordance with PSC authorization.
Workers' compensation administrative proceedings have been commenced, wherein current and former employees claim benefits based upon alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Based on the information and relevant circumstances known to Con Edison of New York, at December31, 2002, a provision of $125.1million was accrued as its estimate of its liability for workers' compensation claims, including those related to asbestos exposure. Of this amount, $54.3million was deferred as a regulatory asset in accordance with PSC authorization.
NoteG - Nuclear Generation In September2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its nuclear generating facilities. See NoteI.
The PSC is investigating the February2000 to January2001 outage of the nuclear generating unit, its causes and the prudence of the Company's actions regarding the operation and maintenance of the generating unit. The proceeding covers, among other things, Con Edison of New York's inspection practices, the circumstances surrounding prior outages, the basis for postponement of the unit's steam generator replacement and whether, and to what extent, increased replacement power costs and repair and replacement costs should be borne by Con Edison's shareholders.
Con Edison of New York has not billed to customers $90million of replacement power costs incurred during the outage. In addition, in 2000, the Company accrued a $40million liability for the possible disallowance of replacement power costs that it had previously recovered from customers.
The Company is unable to predict whether or not any proceedings, lawsuits, legislation or other actions relating to the nuclear generating unit will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
157 NoteH - Non-Utility Generators Con Edison of New York has long-term contracts with non-utility generators (NUGs) for approximately 3,100 MW of electric generating capacity. Assuming performance by the NUGs, the Company is obligated over the terms of the contracts (which extend for various periods, up to 2036) to make capacity and other fixed payments.
For the years 2003 through 2007, the capacity and other fixed payments under the contracts are estimated to be $526million, $530million, $513million, $520million and $531million. Such payments gradually increase to approximately $600million in 2013, and thereafter decline significantly. For energy delivered under most of these contracts, the Company is obligated to pay variable prices that are estimated to be lower than expected market levels.
The NUG contracts include firm contracts for capacity (ends 2005) and energy (ends 2004) from the approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating unit that the Company sold in 2001. For energy from the unit, the Company is obligated to pay an average annual price of 3.9 cents per kWh. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned governmental authorities to shut down the nuclear generating unit. In the event that government authorities did not permit the unit to operate, the unit's owner would not be obligated to provide the Company with power to replace the power the unit would have provided.
Under the terms of its electric rate agreements, the Company is recovering in rates the charges it incurs under mandated contracts with NUGs. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that, following March31, 2005, the Company will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers, the amount, if any, by which the actual costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market value. The PSC specifically approved rate recovery of the nuclear energy purchase.
NoteI - Generation Divestiture Pursuant to restructuring agreements approved by the PSC (see "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" in NoteA). The Company has divested all of its electric generating assets other than approximately 630 MW of electric generating stations located in New York City. The Company sold approximately 6,300 MW of electric generating assets in 1999 and approximately 1,480 MW in 2001.
Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the net after-tax gain (including interest accrued thereon) from Con Edison of New York's 1999 generation divestiture was applied in 2000 as follows: $188.2million was credited against electric distribution plant balances; $107.3million was used to offset a like amount of regulatory assets (including deferred power contract termination costs); $50million (after tax) was deferred for recognition in income during the 12months ended March31, 2002; and $12million was deferred to be used for low-income customer programs. In addition, $30million of employee retirement incentive expense related to the generation divestiture was deferred for amortization over 15years and $15million of such expenses was charged to income in 2000.
The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides for the Company to amortize to income recovery of a $74million regulatory asset representing incremental electric capacity costs incurred prior to May2000 to purchase capacity from the buyers of the generating assets the Company sold in 1999. Amortization to 158 income will take place in years in which the Company would otherwise share excess earnings with customers, in amounts corresponding to the Company's share of the excess earnings. By March2005, any remaining unrecovered balance will be charged to expense. Of this amount, $30million dollars was charged to expense in 2002 and $15million was expensed in 2001.
In January2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its 480 MW interest in the jointly- owned Roseton generating station for $138million. The net after-tax gain from the sale, which has been deferred as a regulatory liability, was $37.1million. In September2001, the Company completed the sale of its approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating plant and related assets for $504.5million. The proceeds were net of a $73.8million payment to increase the value of the nuclear decommissioning trust funds being transferred to $430million (the amount provided for in the sales agreement). The net after-tax loss from the sale, which was been deferred as a regulatory asset, was $174.8million at December31, 2001 and $127.2million at December31, 2002. The Company was authorized, effective September2001, to continue to recover the cost of the deferred nuclear assets, which is included in rates, and to amortize the regulatory asset, until the loss on divestiture has been recovered. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that the Company "will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments."

Options may be granted to officers and key employees of Con Edison and its subsidiaries, for up to a total 10million shares of Con Edison's common stock. Generally, options become exercisable three years after the grant date and remain exercisable until 10years from the grant date.
As permitted by SFAS No.123, the Company elected to follow APB No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under the intrinsic value method of APB No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of Con Edison's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Under the plan, exercise of Con Edison's employee stock options requires payment in full of the exercise price, unless the committee of Con Edison's Board of Directors that administers the Plan determines that options may be settled by paying to the option holder the difference between the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and the exercise price (cash settlement). In 2002, to ensure that the exercise of currently exercisable options would comply with certain technical requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to certain officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries, the committee determined that, 1996 and 1997 stock options covering 295,500 shares of common stock held 160 by those officers may be settled by the cash settlement method. A $3.3million charge to expense was recognized for Con Edison of New York in 2002 for these options. Additional changes to expense will be recognized with respect to these options to the extent the fair market value of the common shares change in future periods.
Disclosure of pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No.123 and SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosures." See "Stock-Based Compensation" in NoteA for an illustration of the effect on net income if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to its stock-based employee compensation. The fair values of 2002, 2001 and 2000 options are $6.37, $5.23 and $4.42 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Risk-free interest rate 5.08% 5.22% 6.25% Expected livesin years 6 8 8 Expected stock volatility 21.43% 21.32% 20.51% Dividend yield 5.22% 5.83% 6.60% A summary of changes in the status of stock options awarded to officers and employees of the Company as of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows: Shares Weighted Average Price Outstanding at 12/31/99 3,433,410 $ 39.313 Granted 1,166,500 32.499 Exercised (68,697 ) 29.732 Forfeited (46,100 ) 39.231 Outstanding at 12/31/00 4,485,113 37.682 Granted 1,287,550 37.760 Exercised (363,013 ) 29.740 Forfeited (63,200 ) 41.414 Outstanding at 12/31/01 5,346,450 38.215 Granted 1,349,850 42.510 Exercised (413,199 ) 30.793 Forfeited (116,950 ) 44.491 Outstanding at 12/31/02 6,166,151 $ 39.532 The following summarizes the Plan's stock options outstanding at December31, 2002: Plan Year Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Outstanding At 12/31/02 Remaining Contractual Life 2002 $ 42.510 1,347,350 9 years 2001 37.760 1,278,050 8 years 2000 32.499 1,143,250 7 years 1999 47.873 1,098,200 6 years 1998 42.610 738,650 5 years 1997 31.500 395,526 4 years 1996 27.875 165,125 3 years 161 As of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 there were vested options outstanding to purchase 1,299,301, 939,850 and 1,304,863 shares of common stock, respectively, at an exercise price below the closing market price on that day. The weighted average exercise prices were $37.33, $30.11 and $31.50, respectively.
As of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 the total number of vested options outstanding were 2,397,501, 1,765,200 and 1,304,863 with weighted average exercise prices of $42.16, $35.90 and $31.50, respectively.
Pursuant to employment agreements, effective September2000, certain senior officers of Con Edison of New York were granted an aggregate of 350,000 restricted stock units, subject to the officers meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. In June2002, an additional 130,000 restricted stock units were granted to certain senior officers of Con Edison of New York under similar terms. The units, each of which represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock and related dividends, vest ratably through August2005 or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for the units over the vesting period. The expense recognized for restricted stock during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $4.2million, $3.1million and $0.9million, respectively.
In June2002, Con Edison terminated its Directors' Retirement Plan applicable to non-officer directors (the termination is not applicable to directors who had previously retired from the board) and adopted a deferred stock compensation plan for these directors. Under the plan, directors were granted stock units for accrued service. Pursuant to APB No.25, Con Edison recognizes compensation expense and accrues a liability for the units. An expense of $2.2million was recorded in 2002.

The cost of the services provided by the Company to Con Edison and its other subsidiaries was $30.5million in 2002, $40.3million in 2001 and $21.1million in 2000. Con Edison and its other subsidiaries, including Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R), also provide services to Con Edison of New York. The cost of the services provided to the Company by Con Edison and its other subsidiaries was $24.4million in 2002, $23.8million in 2001 and $18.7million in 2000. In addition, Con Edison of New York and O&R jointly purchase gas, the cost of which is allocated between the companies based on throughput and other factors. For its share of the gas, O&R paid the Company $102.0million in 2002, $140.9million in 2001 and $103.9million in 2000.
In February2002 the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to O&R, for periods of not more than 12months, in amounts not to exceed $150million outstanding at any time, at prevailing market rates. Through December31, 2002, O&R has not borrowed any funds from the Company.
NoteN - Leases The principal kinds of property leased by the Company include office buildings, transmission and distribution facilities, and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases," these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.
Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered through rates. The following assets and obligations under capital leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) UTILITY PLANT Production $ - $ - Transmission 12.1 13.5 Common 29.0 29.7 TOTAL $ 41.1 $ 43.2 CURRENT LIABILITIES $ 2.6 $ 2.1 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 38.5 41.1 TOTAL LIABILITIES $ 41.1 $ 43.2 The accumulated amortization of the capital leases was $28.8million and $26.8million as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The payments applicable to transformer vault rentals are expected to escalate by 5percent per year until the agreement expires in 2004, at which time a new long-term lease is expected to be signed. The future minimum lease commitments for operating lease agreements are as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $ 37.8 2004 38.5 2005 8.2 2006 5.8 2007 4.8 All years thereafter 20.8 Total $ 115.9 NoteO - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Effective January2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended (SFAS No.133).
Energy Price Hedging The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase or sale of electricity and gas (hedges). As of December31, 2002 and December31, 2001, the fair value of the derivatives for such use was a gain of $15.8million and a loss of $10.3million, respectively.
Pursuant to SFAS No.71, the Company defers recognition in income of gains and losses on a hedge until the underlying transaction is completed. In accordance with rate provisions that permit the recovery of the cost of purchased power and gas purchased for resale, the Company credits or charges to its customers gains or losses on hedges and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA.
165 The Company's 2000 Electric Agreement provides that 10percent of gains or losses on hedges flow to net income as rewards or penalties. The Company has elected cash flow hedge accounting under SFAS No.133 for a qualifying portion of its electric hedges.
Pursuant to cash flow hedge accounting, the mark-to-market unrealized gain or loss on each hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to income at the time the underlying transaction is completed. However, any gain or loss relating to any portion of a hedge determined to be "ineffective" is recognized in income in the period in which such determination is made.
Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for energy transactions, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualifed as hedges, net of $2.3 and ($3.6) taxes $ 3.4 $ (4.9 ) Less: Reclassification adjustment for gains/(losses) included in net income, net of $0.5 and ($2.1) taxes 0.7 (3.0 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualifed as hedges for the period $ 2.7 $ (1.9 ) As of December31, 2002, $0.6million of after-tax net gains relating to hedges are expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to income within the next 12months.
Interest Rate Hedging In October2002, the Company entered into a swap agreement in connection with its $224.6million tax-exempt Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series2001A. Pursuant to the swap agreement provisions, the Company pays interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR and is paid interest at a fixed rate of 5.375percent. The agreement has a term of 10years and is callable at par after three years. The swap is designated as a fair value hedge and qualifies for "short-cut" hedge accounting under SFAS No.133. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the swap instrument are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings. As of December31, 2002, the fair value of the interest rate swap was $7.7million and recorded as an asset and the fair value of the hedged bond was $232.3million.
NoteP - World Trade Center Attack The Company estimates that it will incur $430million of costs for emergency response, temporary restoration and permanent replacement of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged as a result of the September11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Most of the costs are expected to be capital in nature. The Company estimates that $96million of the costs will be covered by insurance. In December2001, Con Edison of New York filed a petition with the PSC for authorization to defer these costs. The Company expects the PSC to permit recovery from customers of the costs, net of any Federal reimbursement, insurance payment and tax savings. In August2002, President Bush signed into law an appropriations bill that authorizes funds for which the Company is eligible to apply to recover costs it incurred in connection with the attack. The procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds are in the process of being developed. At December31, 2002, $134.4million of such costs 166 as utility plant were capitalized and $62.9million of such costs were deferred as a regulatory asset. In addition, at December31, 2001, the Company accrued a regulatory liability to defer recognition in income of an $81.5million tax refund claim resulting from a casualty loss deduction taken by the Company relating to the attack.
NoteQ - New Financial Accounting Standards During 2002 the FASB issued four new accounting standards: SFAS No.145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.13, and Technical Corrections," SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," SFAS No.147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions," and SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure." The FASB also issued Interpretation No.45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," in November2002, and Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," in January2003. In addition, during 2002, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on several issues within EITF Issue No.02-3 "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," one of which was the rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." SFAS No.145 rescinds SFAS No.4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," and SFAS No.64, "Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements," effective January1, 2003. This statement also amends SFAS No.13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have an economic impact similar to sale-leaseback transactions and amends certain other authoritative pronouncements, effective May15, 2002. SFAS No.146, which was effective January1, 2003, requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No.147, which was effective October1, 2002, provides guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of a financial institution. SFAS No.148, which amends SFAS No.123, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No.148 amends the financial statements disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123 regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effects of the method used on reported results. Finally, this statement amends APB No.28, "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The amendment of SFAS No.123 is effective for fiscal years ended after December15, 2002. The amendment of Opinion No.28 is effective for interim periods beginning after December15, 2002. For information about the Company's stock-based compensation, see NoteK.
The adoption of these statements had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45)requires a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. It also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantor's having to make 167 payments under the guarantee is remote. The initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective December15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46)addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities of which the enterprise is the primary beneficiary. The consolidation requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
In June2002, the EITF reached a partial consensus on EITF Issue No.02-3 that revenue resulting from energy trading contracts, whether realized or unrealized and whether financially or physically settled, should be shown net in the income statement. This ruling became effective for periods ending after July2002, with reclassification of prior period amounts required.
On October25, 2002, the EITF reached a consensus to rescind EITF Issue No.98-10. As a result, new energy trading and energy-related contracts entered into after October25, 2002 that do not qualify as derivatives under SFAS No.133 are not marked to market. All derivative contracts will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133. Therefore, previously recognized mark-to-market gains and losses on non-derivative contracts must be reversed upon adoption of this consensus. The effective date for the full rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10 is January1, 2003, with early application permitted.
In October2002, the EITF reached a consensus that gains and losses, realized and unrealized, on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No.133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. This consensus is effective January1, 2003, with early adoption permitted. Additional disclosures regarding energy trading activities required by EITF Issue No.02-3 in June2002 were eliminated in October2002, with the rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10.
The EITF did not reach consensus on whether or not recognition of unrealized gains and losses at inception of an energy-trading contract is appropriate. However, the FASB staff observed that unrealized gains or losses at inception should not be recognized unless the fair value of the derivative instrument is evidenced by a quoted market price, similar current market transactions or valuations based on observable market information.
The above consensus had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
The Company also adopted the following accounting standards that were issued in 2001.
On January1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No.142 provides that goodwill (i.e., the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of a business 168 acquired) and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their finite useful lives. The adoption of SFAS No.142 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which the Company adopted on January1, 2003, requires entities to record the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity will capitalize the cost by increasing the amount of the related asset. The liability will be increased to its present value each period and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement of the asset, the entity will settle the obligation for the amount recorded or incur a gain or loss. The Company has not identified any significant asset retirement obligations. The adoption of SFAS No.143 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which the Company adopted on January1, 2002, replaces SFAS No.121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS No.144 requires that all long-lived assets held for sale or meeting other specified criteria be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. SFAS No.144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS No.144 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

176 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ORANGE AND ROCKLAND UTILITIES,INC.
These notes form an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Orange and Rockland Utilities,Inc. (O&R or the Company) and its subsidiaries.
Con Edison Consolidated Edison,Inc. (Con Edison) acquired O&R in July1999. Con Edison owns all the issued and outstanding shares of O&R's common stock, $5.00 par value per share.
O&R, a regulated utility, along with its utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) and Pike County Light& Power Company (Pike), provide electric service to over 285,000 customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent sections of New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania. O&R and Pike provide gas service to over 120,000 customers in southeastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.
NoteA - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of O&R and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies of O&R and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For regulated public utilities, like O&R, RECO and Pike, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America include the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In accordance with SFAS No.71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction are followed. The Company is subject to regulation by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC); RECO by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and Pike by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC).
SFAS No.71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or "regulatory assets" under SFAS No.71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or "regulatory liabilities" under SFAS No.71.
The Company's principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company is receiving or being credited with a return on all of its regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and is paying or being charged with a return on all of its regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, 177 or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.
Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric In 1997 the PSC, in its Competitive Opportunities proceeding, approved a four-year Restructuring Plan pursuant to which the Company reduced its electric rates in 1997 and 1998, and in 1999 sold all of its generating assets and made retail access available to all of its electric customers.
The RECO plan approved by the NJBPU in 1999 provided rate reductions of $6.8million effective August1999 and an additional rate reduction of $2.7million implemented in January2001. A final rate reduction of $6.2million was implemented in August2002.
The Pike plan approved by the PPUC in 1998 provided retail access to all customers effective May1999.
In 1999, the PSC ratified a settlement agreement approving the acquisition of O&R by Con Edison. As part of this settlement, gas rates were reduced by $1.1million in August1999 and electric rates were reduced by $6.1million in December1999. This settlement allowed for a five-year amortization of transaction costs. The NJBPU and the PPUC also issued orders approving the transaction. The NJBPU's order provided for a 75 / 25 percent customer/shareholder sharing of net synergy savings and a ten-year amortization of transaction costs. The customers' 75percent share of net synergy savings is being returned to them as part of the rate reduction effective August1999. The PPUC agreement allows Pike to retain all net synergy savings until its next general rate case and provides for a five-year amortization of transaction costs.
In October2002, RECO filed a request with the NJBPU seeking an increase in electric rates of $7.3million (5.5percent) annually, to take effect on August1, 2003, principally to reflect the costs of electric system infrastructure improvements required for service reliability and security. A final ruling by the NJBPU is expected in the third quarter of 2003.
In August2002, the PPUC approved a settlement agreement covering the rates Pike charges for energy cost recoveries. As part of this settlement, Pike agreed to terminate its Competitive Transition Charge (CTC) and not to file for an increase in delivery rates that would be effective prior to December31, 2004. The settlement provides for an increase in Pike's Provider of Last Resort (POLR) energy rates of .577 cents per kWh, inclusive of gross receipts tax, retroactive to July1, 2002. This represents approximately a 6.0percent increase in Pike's overall rates. A potential further increase of 5.0percent of the POLR energy rate or an addition of .28 cents per kWh effective January2005 is contingent on the actual and projected cost of energy at that time. The settlement is estimated to increase revenues by a net $1.4million between September2002 and December2005.
Gas In November2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement among O&R, the PSC Staff, and the Consumer Protection Board covering the period from November2000 through April2002. In October2001, the PSC approved an extension of this agreement covering the period May2002 through October2003. With limited exceptions, the agreement, as extended, provides for no changes to base rates. The Company was permitted to retain, and is amortizing to income, $18.1million of deferred 178 credits that otherwise would have been returned to customers. Earnings for gas operations above a threshold of 11.1percent are subject to a 50 / 50 sharing mechanism between customer and shareholder. The 11.1percent sharing threshold is subject to a positive adjustment of up to 85 basis points for the attainment of competitive awareness and customer migration goals. The Company is subject to a potential earnings penalty of $450,000 per year for failure to meet minimum levels of performance regarding main replacement, gas leak backlog, customer safety complaints and protection of underground facilities.
In November2002, O&R filed a request with the PSC for approval of a $27.2million rate gas increase effective November2003. The Company also submitted a multi-year plan that addresses rates for two additional years, with an increase of $2.5million to cover infrastructure costs, inflation and property taxes. The Administrative Law Judge is expected to issue a recommended decision in the third quarter 2003.
Utility Revenues Utility revenues are recorded on the basis of monthly customer cycle billings. Unbilled revenues are accrued at the end of each month for estimated energy usage since the last meter reading. Accrued unbilled revenue included in the Company's balance sheet at December31, 2002 and 2001 was $20.4million and $20.7million, respectively.
The level of revenues from gas sales in New York is subject to a weather normalization clause that requires recovery from or refund to firm customers of the shortfalls or excesses of firm net revenues that result from variations of more than plus or minus four percent in actual degree days from the number of degree days used to project heating season sales.
Recoverable Energy Costs O&R generally recovers all of its prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy costs for a given month are more or less than amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed energy costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle (normally within one or two months). For gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a subsequent 12-month period.
RECO recovers all of its prudently incurred purchased power costs pursuant to rate provisions approved by the NJBPU. Differences between actual and billed electricity costs (which, for the period August1, 1999 through December31, 2002 amounted to $79.7million) are deferred for charge or refund to customers in the manner and at such time as is to be determined by the NJBPU. In August2002, RECO submitted a petition to the NJBPU requesting recovery under New Jersey's 1999 Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of $110million of electric purchased power costs in excess of amounts previously billed to customers, associated interest and other deferred charges. Recovery of these costs from customers is requested over a four-year period or pursuant to a plan to "securitize" the costs (under which RECO would be reimbursed these costs with the proceeds of a financing that would be repaid over 179 time by its customers). In January2003, the initial results of an independent audit, commissioned by the NJBPU to review the prudence of these deferred costs, were issued. The audit recommends that RECO be disallowed recovery of $26.8million of such costs and associated interest of $2.6million. The Company believes that its actions were prudent and has filed a response to the audit findings. A decision on the recovery of these purchased power costs by the NJBPU is expected in the third quarter of 2003.
Pike's recoveries of its energy costs are limited to a fixed price reflected in its current rates. In August2002, the PPUC approved a settlement agreement covering the rates Pike charges for energy cost recoveries. See "Rate and Restructuring Agreements" above.
Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC). The original cost of property, together with removal cost, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized.
Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on the utility's own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of FERC and the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The AFDC rate for O&R was 8.4percent in 2002, 4.6percent in 2001 and 7.4percent in 2000. The AFDC rate for RECO was 9.2percent in 2002, 9.1percent in 2001 and 9.1percent in 2000. The rate was compounded semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds were treated as a reduction of interest charges while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities' own funds is credited to other income (deductions).
For financial reporting purposes, depreciation rates are computed on the straight-line method based on the estimated average service lives and net salvage factors of the various classes of property. The Company's depreciation rates averaged 3.3percent in 2002 and 2001 and 3.4percent in 2000. The estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 60years for electric, 7 to 75years for gas and 5 to 50years for general plant.
Non-utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost and consists primarily of land and assets that are currently not utilized within utility operations. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (7-50years).
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. O&R considers temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the Company has recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Company has 180 recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability it will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or "turn-around" of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No.71, regulatory assets have been established for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense (see NoteK). In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No.109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction in future federal income tax expense.
O&R and its subsidiaries filea consolidated federal income tax return as part of the consolidated return for Con Edison. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays tax or receives a benefit based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.
State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed, effective January1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to the tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being collected and the tax expense resulting from the tax law changes, until those changes are incorporated in base rates.
O&R and its subsidiaries filea combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return on a consolidated basis with Con Edison and its other subsidiaries. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the Company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives a benefit based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The PSC requires the Company to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis (i.e., included in both revenue and expense). The recovery of these taxes is part of the PSC approved revenue requirement within each of the respective regulated rate agreements.
Deferred Revenue Taxes Deferred revenue taxes represent the unamortized balance of an accelerated payment of New Jersey Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax (NJGRFT) required by legislation effective June1, 1991, as well as New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority taxes that are deferred and amortized over a 12-month period following payment, in accordance with the requirements of the PSC. The deferred NJGRFT is being recovered in rates, with a carrying charge of 7.5percent on the unamoritized balance, over a five-year period.
181 Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. See NoteL. The following table illustrates the effect on net income if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to stock-based employee compensation.
2002 2001 2000 (in millions) Net income, as reported $ 45 $ 40 $ 39 Pro forma net income $ 45 $ 40 $ 39 These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures due to changes in future market conditions and additional grants in future years.
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NoteB - Capitalization Common Stock At December31, 2002 and 2001, O&R had 1,000 shares of common stock, $5.00 par value per share, issued and outstanding, all of which was owned by Con Edison. Con Edison acquired O&R in July1999.
Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that O&R may pay are limited to not more than 100percent of its income available for dividends, calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of "income available for dividends" are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing O&R's equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.
182 Long-Term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the period 2003-2007 is as follows: (Millions of Dollars) 2003 $ 35 2004 - 2005 - 2006 - 2007 20 Long-term debt includes the notes issued by O&R to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) for the net proceeds of NYSERDA's $55million aggregate principal amount of Series1994A and $44million aggregate principal amount of Series1995A Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds. The interest rate determination method for this debt is subject to change in accordance with the related indenture, and the debt currently bears interest at a weekly rate determined by its remarketing agent. The debt is subject to optional and, in certain circumstances, mandatory tender for purchase by the Company. See NoteN.
At December31, 2002, long term-debt also includes $23.2million of mortgage bonds collateralized by substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of O&R's utility subsidiaries, RECO and Pike.
Long-term debt is stated at cost, which, as of December31, 2002 approximates fair value (estimate based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities).
Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions, under the financing arrangements for the debentures of O&R. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of O&R are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of O&R to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like-amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to a disqualifying change in use of the facilities financed. The arrangements also include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities.
The failure to comply with these debt covenants, if continued, would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied, in which case the principal and accrued interest on the debt may and, in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.
183 NoteC - Short-term Borrowing At December31, 2002, the Company had a $100million commercial paper program under which short-term borrowings are made at prevailing market rates. The program is supported by a revolving credit agreement with banks. At December31, 2002, $1.0million, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.3percent per annum, was outstanding under the program. The Company may change the amount of its program from time to time, subject to a $150million FERC-authorized limit.
Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreement were renewed in November2002. The commitments may terminate upon a change in control of Con Edison or O&R and borrowings under the agreement are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio (calculated in accordance with the agreement) of debt to total capital of the borrower does not at any time exceed 0.65 to 1. At December31, 2002, the ratio was 0.49 to 1 for O&R. Borrowings under the agreement are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels. The fees charged for the revolving credit agreement and borrowings under the agreement reflect the credit ratings of the Company.
See NoteI for information about short-term borrowing from a related party, which the FERC has authorized.
NoteD - Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees and retirees of O&R, pursuant to the Consolidated Edison Retirement Plan (which resulted from the merger, effective January1, 2001, of the separate pension plans previously applicable to the employees and retirees of Con Edison of New York and O&R). The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.71, the Company defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and the current rate allowance authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction in which it operates.
The components of the Company's net periodic benefit costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Service cost - including administrative expenses $ 6,355 $ 6,251 $ 4,887 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 27,589 27,016 25,397 Expected return on plan assets (24,797 ) (24,831 ) (22,118 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 5,825 4,547 3,557 Amortization of prior service cost 431 416 - NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST 15,403 13,399 11,723 Deferred and capitalized 12,965 10,582 7,677 Net expense $ 2,438 $ 2,817 $ 4,046 184 The funded status at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 374,424 $ 358,173 $ 326,472 Service cost - excluding administrative expenses 5,955 5,852 4,887 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 27,589 27,016 25,397 Plan amendments - 273 5,114 Net actuarial loss 16,482 2,763 14,669 Benefits paid (21,001 ) (19,653 ) (18,366 ) PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR $ 403,449 $ 374,424 $ 358,173 CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 236,213 $ 270,127 $ 289,311 Actual return on plan assets (19,374 ) (14,955 ) (2,192 ) Employer contributions 1,855 1,797 3,207 Benefits paid (21,001 ) (19,653 ) (18,366 ) Administrative expenses (952 ) (1,103 ) (1,833 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR $ 196,741 $ 236,213 $ 270,127 Funded status $ (206,708 ) $ (138,211 ) $ (88,046 ) Unrecognized net loss 144,639 89,258 50,552 Unrecognized prior service costs 4,540 4,972 5,114 ACCRUED BENEFIT COST $ (57,529 ) $ (43,981 ) $ (32,380 ) The amounts recognized in the balance sheet at December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 (Thousands of Dollars) Accrued benefit cost $ (57,529 ) $ (43,981 ) Additional minimum pension liability (1,625 ) (1,538 ) Intangible asset 160 169 Accumulated other comprehensive income 1,465 1,369 Net prepaid benefit cost $ (57,529 ) $ (43,981 ) The actuarial assumptions at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Discount Rate 6.75 % 7.50 % 7.75 % Expected Return on Plan Assets 9.20 % 9.20 % 8.50 % Rate of Compensation Increase 4.15 % 4.15 % 4.40 % O&R also offers a defined contribution savings plan that covers substantially all of its employees and made contributions to the plan of $1.0million, $1.0million and $0.8million for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
NoteE - Other Postretirement Benefits O&R has a contributory medical and prescription drug program for all retirees, their dependents and surviving spouses. The Company also has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees.
185 Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.
Plan assets are used to pay benefits and expenses for participants who retired on or after January1, 1995. O&R pays benefits for other participants who retired prior to January1, 1995. Plan assets include amounts owed by the trust to the Company of $0.8million in 2002, $0.3million in 2001 and $2.2million in 2000.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.71, the Company defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No.106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions" and the current rate allowance authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction in which it operates.
The components of the net periodic postretirement benefit (health and life insurance) costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Service cost $ 1,884 $ 1,577 $ 1,478 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 7,996 7,069 6,856 Expected return on plan assets (4,245 ) (3,721 ) (3,188 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss 2,797 1,260 901 Amortization of prior service cost (97 ) (97 ) - NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ 8,335 $ 6,088 $ 6,047 Amortized/(deferred and capitalized) (4,447 ) (2,193 ) (1,602 ) Net expense $ 3,888 $ 3,895 $ 4,445 186 The funded status of the programs at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was as follows: 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) CHANGE IN BENEFIT OBLIGATION Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 101,726 $ 94,048 $ 88,536 Service cost 1,884 1,577 1,478 Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 7,996 7,069 6,856 Plan amendments - - (979 ) Net actuarial loss 26,926 5,096 2,992 Benefits paid and administrative expenses (6,876 ) (6,310 ) (5,041 ) Participant contributions 260 246 206 BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT END OF YEAR $ 131,916 $ 101,726 $ 94,048 CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 40,646 $ 39,069 $ 37,890 Actual return on plan assets 54 106 162 Employer contributions 6,267 6,088 2,500 Participant contributions 155 126 113 Benefits paid and administrative expenses (4,170 ) (4,743 ) (1,596 ) FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT END OF YEAR $ 42,952 $ 40,646 $ 39,069 Funded status $ (88,964 ) $ (61,080 ) $ (54,979 ) Unrecognized net loss 50,817 22,393 13,312 Unrecognized prior service costs (785 ) (882 ) (979 ) ACCRUED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST $ (38,932 ) $ (39,569 ) $ (42,646 ) The actuarial assumptions at December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows: 2002 2001 2000 Discount rate 6.75 % 7.50 % 7.75 % EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS Tax-exempt assets 9.20 % 9.20 % 8.50 % Taxable assets 8.70 % 8.70 % 8.00 % The health care cost trend rate assumed for 2003 is 9.0percent. The rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75percent by 2009 and remain at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: 1-Percentage-Point Increase 1-Percentage-Point Decrease (Thousands of Dollars) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 12,698 $ (10,918 ) Effect on service cost and interest cost components $ 1,192 $ (998 ) Note F - Environmental Matters Hazardous substances such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar have been used or generated in the course of operations of O&R and are present in its facilities and equipment currently or previously owned.
187 The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) and similar state statutes impose joint and several strict liabilities, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for resulting removal and remediation costs and environmental damages. Liabilities under these laws can be material and in some instances may be imposed without regard to fault, or may be imposed for past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred.
The environmental remediation costs for the sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability for remediation under Superfund or similar state statutes, including its manufactured gas sites, (Superfund Sites) include investigation, demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring costs.
For the cleanup of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants at the manufactured gas sites, estimates of the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the cleanup of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants range from approximately $25million to $95million. To develop these estimates, the assumption was made that there is contamination at the sites where investigation has not yet been started or completed. Additional assumptions were made as to the extent of contamination, the level of cleanup required and the type and extent of remediation that will be required. Actual experience may be materially different from these assumptions.
For sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Company is not managing the site investigation and remediation, the liability accrued represents the Company's estimate of what it will need to pay to settle its obligations with respect to the site. For other sites, the liability accrued represents the Company's estimate of its investigation and remediation costs for the site. In either case, the Company makes its estimate of its undiscounted liability for each site in light of the applicable remediation standards, experience with similar sites, the information it has available to it at the time about the site and site-specific assumptions about such matters as the extent of contamination and remediation and monitoring methods to be used. The liability accrued for Superfund Sites is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted as determined to be necessary.
At December31, 2002, O&R had accrued $35.3million as its estimate of its liability for Superfund Sites, including approximately $34million relating to manufactured gas sites. Most of the accrued liability relates to Superfund Sites where contamination has been detected and investigated in whole or in part. There will be additional liability relating to the Superfund Sites and other sites. The amount of the additional liability is not presently determinable but may be material to O&R's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. O&R is permitted under current rate agreements to defer for subsequent recovery through rates certain site investigation and remediation costs with respect to hazardous waste. At December31, 2002, $30.8million of such costs had been deferred as a regulatory asset.
In 2002, O&R incurred $1.5million for environmental remediation costs and received an insurance recovery of $7.2million related to Superfund Sites.
188 Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against O&R and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of O&R. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by O&R, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to the Company. The amounts specified in all the remaining suits total billions of dollars. However, O&R believes that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through the disposition of previous claims. Based on the information and relevant circumstances known to O&R at this time, these suits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on O&R's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Workers' compensation administrative proceedings have been commenced, wherein current and former employees claim benefits upon alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Based on the information and relevant circumstances known to O&R at this time, these claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on O&R's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. At December31, 2002, a $5.4million provision was accrued as the Company's estimate of its liability for these workers' compensation claims, including those related to asbestos, and $1.6million of this provision was deferred as a regulatory asset related to claims of the former employees of the divested plants.
In May2000, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation issued notices of violation to O&R and four other companies that have operated coal-fired electric generating facilities in New York State. The notices allege violations of the Federal Clean Air Act and the New York State Environmental Conservation Law resulting from the alleged failure to install pollution control equipment that would have reduced emissions of certain chemicals deemed potentially hazardous. The notice of violations received by O&R relates to the Lovett Generating Station, which it sold in June1999. The Company is unable to predict whether or not alleged violations will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
NoteG - Non-Utility Generators O&R has contracts with Non-Utility Generators (NUGs) for 27 MW of electric generating capacity. The contracts extend for various periods, up to 2008. Assuming performance by the NUGs, O&R is obligated to purchase capacity and energy under the contracts. For the years 2003 through 2007, fixed payments under the contracts are estimated to be $17.2million, $16.7million, $16.4million, $5.6million and $3.6million. In addition, for energy delivered under one of the contracts (for 19 MW), O&R is obligated to pay variable prices that are currently estimated to be above market levels. O&R recovers its costs under the contracts pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
NoteH - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities O&R has established various regulatory assets and liabilities to defer specific costs and gains that the applicable regulatory agencies have permitted or are expected to permit to be recovered in rates or refunded to customers over time. For RECO, current recovery of purchased power costs is subject to certain limitations imposed by the NJBPU and costs that are not currently recovered are deferred for 189 future recovery. At December31, 2002 and December31, 2001, net recoverable purchased power costs of $79.7million and $76.7million, respectively, were deferred by RECO for future recovery.
NoteI - Related Party Transactions Each month O&R is invoiced by Con Edison and its affiliates for the cost of any services rendered to O&R by Con Edison and its affiliates. These services, provided primarily by Con Edison's other regulated subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Company of New York,Inc., include substantially all administrative support operations, such as corporate directorship and associated ministerial duties, accounting, treasury, investor relations, information resources, legal, human resources, fuel supply and energy management services. The cost of these services was $15.2million for 2002, $14.4million for 2001 and $10.7million for 2000. In addition, O&R purchased from Con Edison of New York $102.0million, $140.9million and $103.9million of natural gas for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and $24.6million of electricity in 2002.
O&R provides certain recurring services to Con Edison of New York on a monthly basis, including cash receipts processing and certain administrative services. The cost of these services, which are invoiced to Con Edison of New York, totaled $11.6million, $10.9million and $8.3million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
In February2002, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to O&R, for periods of not more than 12months, in amounts not to exceed $150million outstanding at any time at prevailing market rates. Through December31, 2002, O&R has not borrowed any funds from Con Edison of New York.

Options may be granted to officers and key employees of Con Edison and its subsidiaries for up to a total of 10million shares of Con Edison's common stock. Generally, options become exercisable three years after the grant date and remain exercisable until 10years from the grant date.
As permitted by SFAS No.123, O&R elected to follow APB No.25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under the intrinsic value method of APB No.25, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of Con Edison's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Under the plan, exercise of Con Edison's employee stock options requires payment in full of the exercise price, unless the committee of Con Edison's Board of Directors that administers the Plan determines that options may be settled by paying to the option holder the difference between the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and the exercise price (cash settlement). In 2002, to ensure that the exercise of currently exercisable options would comply with certain technical requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to certain officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries, the committee determined that 1996 and 1997 stock options covering 295,500 shares of common stock held by those officers may be settled by the cash settlement method. A $0.4million charge to expense was recognized for O&R in 2002 for these options. Additional changes to expense will be recognized with respect to these options to the extent the fair market value of the common shares changes in future periods.
192 Disclosure of pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No.123 and SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosures." See "Stock-based Compensation" in NoteA for an illustration of the effect on net income if O&R had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to its stock-based employee compensation. The fair values of 2002, 2001 and 2000 options are $6.37, $5.23 and $4.42 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black- Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Risk-free interest rate 5.08 % 5.22 % 6.25 % Expected lives - in years 6 8 8 Expected stock volatility 21.43 % 21.32 % 20.51 % Dividend yield 5.22 % 5.83 % 6.60 % A summary of the changes in the status of stock options awarded to officers and employees of O&R under the Plan as of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows: Shares Weighted Average Price Outstanding at 12/31/99 - Granted 73,000 $ 32.500 Exercised - - Forfeited - - Outstanding at 12/31/00 73,000 32.500 Granted 101,000 37.750 Exercised - - Forfeited - - Outstanding at 12/31/01 174,000 35.547 Granted 113,000 42.510 Exercised - - Forfeited (2,000 ) 35.125 Outstanding at 12/31/02 285,000 $ 38.311 The following summarizes the Plan's stock options outstanding at December31, 2002: Plan Year Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Outstanding At 12/31/02 Remaining Contractual Life 2002 $ 42.510 113,000 9 years 2001 37.750 100,000 8 years 2000 32.500 72,000 7 years As of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, no options were exercisable.
In June2002, 20,000 restricted stock units were granted to a senior officer of O&R, subject to the officer meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. The units, each of which represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock and related dividends, vest ratably through August2005 or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. Pursuant to APB No.25, O&R recognizes 193 compensation expense and accrues a liability for the units over the vesting period. The expense recognized for restricted stock during 2002 was $0.2million.
In June2002, Con Edison terminated its Directors' Retirement Plan applicable to non-officer directors (the termination is not applicable to directors who had previously retired from the board) and adopted a deferred stock compensation plan for these directors. Under the plan, directors were granted stock units for accrued service. Pursuant to APB No.25, O&R recognizes compensation expense as incurred. An expense of $0.1million was recorded in 2002.
NoteM - Financial Information by Business Segment O&R's business segments were determined based on similarities in economic characteristics, the regulatory environment and management's reporting requirements. O&R's business segments are:  Regulated Electric - consists of regulated utility activities relating to the transmission and distribution and sale of electricity in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Regulated Gas - consists of regulated utility activities relating to the transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas in New York and Pennsylvania.
Unregulated Subsidiary - represents the operations of O&R's unregulated subsidiary in a land development business. The Company is pursuing the closure of its real estate operations and is in the process of selling off remaining land holdings.
All revenues of O&R's business segments are from customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets are located in the United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. See NoteA.
Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.
The financial data for business segments are as follows: Regulated Electric 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 475,462 $ 538,375 $ 513,016 Intersegment revenues - - 11 Depreciation and amortization 25,881 24,892 20,625 Income tax expense 20,303 22,716 20,174 Operating income 57,506 50,223 47,529 Interest charge 20,478 15,724 16,912 Total assets 862,770 837,535 828,489 Construction expenditures 44,151 44,571 33,751 194 Regulated Gas 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 158,838 $ 197,862 $ 183,436 Intersegment revenues - - - Depreciation and amortization 8,121 7,888 6,501 Income tax expense 4,406 3,536 1,100 Operating income 14,507 13,145 11,091 Interest charge 7,742 8,414 8,430 Total assets 308,141 294,769 304,305 Construction expenditures 15,574 17,010 17,528 Unregulated Subsidiaries 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues - $ 104 $ 4,521 Intersegment revenues - - - Depreciation and amortization - - 3 Income tax expense 95 218 1,551 Operating income (353 ) (366 ) 1,821 Interest charge  3 17 Total assets 2,774 3,036 5,863 Construction expenditures - - - Total 2002 2001 2000 (Thousands of Dollars) Operating revenues $ 634,300 $ 736,341 $ 700,973 Intersegment revenues - - 11 Depreciation and amortization 34,002 32,780 27,129 Income tax expense 24,804 26,470 22,825 Operating income 71,660 63,002 60,441 Interest charge 28,220 24,141 25,359 Total assets 1,161,261 1,135,340 1,138,657 Construction expenditures 59,725 61,581 51,279 NoteN - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Effective January2001, O&R adopted SFAS No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended (SFAS No.133).
Energy Price Hedging O&R uses derivative instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase or sale of electricity (hedges). As of December31, 2002 and December31, 2001, the fair value of the derivatives for such use was a gain of $1.1million and a loss of $1.0million, respectively.
Pursuant to SFAS No.71, the Company defers recognition in income of gains and losses on a hedge until the underlying transaction is completed. In accordance with rate provisions that permit the recovery of the cost of purchased power, O&R credits or charges to its customers gains and losses on hedges and related transaction costs. See "Recoverable Energy Costs" in NoteA.
195 Interest Rate Hedging O&R uses interest rate swap agreements to convert portions of its variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. In connection with its $55million promissory note issued to NYSERDA for the net proceeds of NYSERDA's variable rate Pollution Control Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series1994A (the 1994 Bonds), O&R has a swap agreement pursuant to which it pays interest at a fixed rate of 6.09percent and is paid interest at the same variable rate as is paid on the 1994 Bonds. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No.133. Any gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. As of December31, 2002 and December31, 2001, the fair value of the O&R interest rate swap was a loss of $19.1million and $14.2million, respectively.
Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for interest rate hedging, net of tax, included in accumulated OCI for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges due to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of ($5.7) taxes $ - $ (8.1 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges, net of ($3.1) and ($1.0) taxes (4.4 ) (1.4 ) Less: Reclassification adjustment for gains/(losses) included in net income, net of ($1.1) and ($0.8) taxes (1.5 ) (1.2 ) Unrealized gains/(losses) on derivatives qualified as hedges for the period $ (2.9 ) $ (8.3 ) As of December31, 2002, $1.2million of the existing after-tax losses relating to the swap agreement are expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to income within the next 12months.
NoteO - New Financial Accounting Standards During 2002 the FASB issued four new accounting standards: SFAS No.145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.13, and Technical Corrections," SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," SFAS No.147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions," and SFAS No.148, "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure." The FASB also issued Interpretation No.45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," in November2002 and Interpretation No.46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," in January2003. In addition, during 2002, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on several issues within EITF Issue No.02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," one of which was the rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." SFAS No.145 rescinds SFAS No.4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," and SFAS No.64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements," effective January1, 2003. This statement also amends SFAS No.13, "Accounting for Leases," to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have an economic impact similar to sale-leaseback transactions and amends certain other authoritative accounting pronouncement, effective May15, 2002. SFAS No.146, which was effective January1, 2003, requires companies to recognize costs 196 associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No.147, which was effective October1, 2002, provides guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of a financial institution. SFAS No.148, which amends SFAS No.123, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No.148 amends the financial statement disclosure requirements of SFAS No.123 regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effects of the method used on reported results. Finally, this statement amends APB Opinion No.28, "Interim Financial Reporting" to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. The amendment of SFAS No.123 is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. The amendment of Opinion No.28 is effective for interim periods beginning after December15, 2002. For information about the Company's stock-based compensation, see NoteL.
The adoption of these statements had no impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45)requires a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. It also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantor's having to make payments under the guarantee is remote. The initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective December15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 had no impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46)addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities of which the enterprise is the primary beneficiary. The consolidation requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have any impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
In June2002, the EITF reached a partial consensus on EITF Issue No.02-3, "Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities," that revenue resulting from energy trading contracts, whether realized or unrealized and whether financially or physically settled, should be shown net in the income statement. The new ruling became effective for periods ending after July2002 with reclassification of prior period amounts required.
On October25, 2002, the EITF reached a consensus to rescind EITF Issue No.98-10, "Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As a result, new energy trading and energy-related contracts entered into after October25, 2002, that do not qualify as derivatives under SFAS No.133 are not marked-to-market. All derivative contracts will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.133. Therefore, previously recognized mark-to-market gains and losses on 197 non-derivative contracts must be reversed upon adoption of this consensus. The effective date for the full rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10 was January1, 2003, with early application permitted.
In October2002, the EITF reached a consensus that gains and losses, realized and unrealized, on all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No.133 should be shown net in the income statement, whether or not settled physically, if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. This consensus was effective January1, 2003, with early adoption permitted. Additional disclosures regarding energy trading activities required by EITF Issue No.02-3 in June2002 were eliminated in October2002, with the rescission of EITF Issue No.98-10.
The EITF did not reach consensus on whether or not recognition of unrealized gains and losses at inception of an energy-trading contract is appropriate. However, the FASB staff observed that unrealized gains or losses at inception should not be recognized unless the fair value of the derivative instrument is evidenced by a quoted market price, similar current market transactions or valuations based on observable market information.
The above EITF consensus had no impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
O&R also adopted the following accounting standards that were issued in 2001.
On January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No.142 provides that goodwill (i.e., the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of a business acquired) and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their finite useful lives. The adoption of SFAS No.142 had no impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
SFAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which O&R adopted on January1, 2003, requires entities to record the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity will capitalize the cost by increasing the amount of the related asset. The liability will be increased to its present value each period and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement of the asset, the entity will settle the obligation for the amount recorded or incur a gain or loss. O&R has not identified any asset retirement obligations. The adoption of SFAS No.143 had no impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which O&R adopted on January1, 2002, replaces SFAS No.121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS No.144 requires that all long-lived assets held for sale or meeting other specified criteria be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. SFAS No.144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS No.144 had no impact on O&R's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
