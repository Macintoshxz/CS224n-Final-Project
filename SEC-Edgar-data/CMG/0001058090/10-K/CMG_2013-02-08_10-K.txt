BUSINESS General Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Chipotle, the Company, or we) operate Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants, which serve a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads, made using fresh ingredients. As of December31, 2012, we operated 1,410 restaurants, including Chipotle restaurants throughout the United States, as well as five in Canada, five in London, England, and one in Paris, France, and also one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, a restaurant in Washington, D.C. serving Asian-inspired cuisine. We focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food; on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional; on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing; and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment. We have grown substantially over the past five years, and expect to open between 165 and 180 additional restaurants in 2013.
Our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine-dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customerfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we caningredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food.
We manage our operations and restaurants based on six regions that aggregate into one reportable segment. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, and our total assets as of December31, 2012 and 2011, is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the U.S.
Our Menu and Food Preparation Food With Integrity.
Serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. As part of our Food With Integrity philosophy, we believe that purchasing fresh ingredients and preparing them by hand are not enough, so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised. Because our menu is so focused, we can concentrate on the sources of each ingredient, and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food.
In all of our restaurants, we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones, and in accordance with criteria weve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare.One of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats raised to meet our standards, but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef for short periods during 2012 and the beginning of 2013, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints. When we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat, we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so.
In the past we referred to meat raised in accordance with our criteria as naturally raised, but we are moving away from that terminology and instead have begun to use the Responsibly Raised brand to differentiate our meat and other ingredients. We think the Responsibly Raised brand helps to better distinguish our ingredients from other products labeled as naturally raised.
3 Table of Contents Were also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce, meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees. A portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown, or sourced locally while in season (by which we mean grown within 350 miles of the restaurant). A portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is sustainably grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions, reduce erosion, and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown. Our commitment to Food With Integrity extends to the dairy products we serve as well. The sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone). Also, milk used to make much of our cheese and some of our sour cream is sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows.
We do, however, face challenges associated with pursuing Food With Integrity. There are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality, sustainability and other responsible practices. Growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens, cattle and pigs that are not fed subtherapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones. Crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower. It can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat, dairy and produce ingredients. Given the costs associated with what we believe are responsible farming practices, and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment, many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area. However, we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food, consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised. And we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability, they will foster greater demand for sustainably grown foods in the long term. We believe that increased demand over the long term for the types of meat and produce items we strive to serve will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers. We also understand that well continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing Food With Integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices. If we are able to continue growing while focusing on Food With Integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time, though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised, commodity-priced equivalents.
A Few Things, Thousands of Ways.
Chipotle restaurants serve only a few things: burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and salads. But because customers can choose from four different meats, two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas, guacamole, cheese and lettuce, theres enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices. We plan to keep a simple menu, but well consider additions that we think make sense. And if you cant find something on the menu thats quite what youre after, let us know. If we can make it from the ingredients we have, well do it.
In preparing our food, we use stoves and grills, pots and pans, cutting knives, wire whisks and other kitchen utensils, walk-in refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients, herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice. Ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants, carnitas (seasoned and braised pork), barbacoa (spicy shredded beef) and pinto and vegetarian black beans. We add our rice, which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro, as well as freshly shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, peppers and onions, depending on each customers request. We use various herbs, spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables. We also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole, salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt. In addition to sodas, fruit drinks and organic milk, most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas. Our food is prepared from scratch, with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries.
Food Served Fast  So That Customers Can Enjoy It Slowly.
Our employees spend hours preparing our food on-site, but each customer order can be ready in seconds. Customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order. While we think that our customers return because of the great-tasting food, we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a fast-food experience, even when theyre not in a hurry. And while our restaurants often have lines, we try to serve customers as quickly as possible. Weve even been able to serve more than 300 4 Table of Contents customers an hour at some locations. The natural flow of our restaurant layout, including the floor plan and the design of our serving line, are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and, we believe, more efficient. And we constantly strive to improve the speed of service in all of our restaurants, so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic. For instance, our restaurants accept orders by fax, online or through an iPhone ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line. By emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews, and by continually making improvements to our restaurants, we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers.
Quality Assurance and Food Safety.
We are committed to serving safe, high quality food to our customers. Quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do; from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line. We have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry, and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase. Our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain. Our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality, preparation, cleanliness and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also designed to assure that we comply with applicable federal, state and local food safety regulations.
Restaurant Management and Operations Culture of Top Performers.
In addition to our focus on the food we serve, we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying, hiring and empowering top performing employees. We are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers. The foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best people in our restaurants. We make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards, yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success. We believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard, provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower a team of top performers. We provide hands on, shoulder-to-shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees. We are committed to developing our people and promoting from within, with about 96% of salaried management and almost 99% of hourly management coming from internal promotions. Our best general managers, who run great restaurants and develop strong, empowered restaurant teams, are promoted to Restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people. Weve leveraged our outstanding Restaurateurs leadership by giving many Restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants. This provides an opportunity for Restaurateurs to develop field leadership roles one restaurant at a time. Restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of all top performers (including at least one Restaurateur), thereby creating a culture of high standards, constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants, can be promoted to apprentice team leaders.
Importance of Methods and Culture.
Although we have many restaurants, we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fast-food and fast-casual restaurants helps to set us apart. Our crews use classic cooking methods: they marinate and grill meats, hand-cut produce and herbs, make fresh salsa and guacamole, and cook rice in small batches throughout the day. They work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of high-end restaurants than they do a typical fast-food place. Despite our more labor-intensive method of food preparation, our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants.
The Front Line is Key . Our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service, and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh, each and every day. All of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job, whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period. We focus on attracting 5 Table of Contents and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer one burrito at a time. We provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way. We believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among general managers, crew members and customers alike.
The Basics.
Each restaurant typically has a general manager (a position weve characterized as the most important in the company), an apprentice manager (in about three-quarters of our restaurants), one or two hourly service managers, one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 21 full and part-time crew members. We generally have two shifts at our restaurants, which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees. We tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants. We cross-train our people so that each can work a variety of stations, allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times, while giving our people the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills. Consistent with our emphasis on customer service, we encourage our general managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day. In addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant, we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders, team leaders or area managers, team directors, executive team directors or regional directors, and restaurant support officers.
Supply Chain Close Relationships with Suppliers.
Maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire high-quality, fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Our distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission, and we seek to develop mutually beneficial long-term relationships with suppliers. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, exchange rates, foreign demand, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Certain key ingredients (beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, and tortillas) are purchased from a small number of suppliers.
We generally do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers, but have selected and approved suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants. Distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select and approve based on our quality specifications, and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers.
Distribution Arrangements.
Ingredients and other supplies are delivered to our restaurants from 23 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers.
Marketing Our marketing has always been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands arent built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone, but rather through all of the ways people experience the brand. So we pay close attention to all of these details, looking to keep our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience Chipotle. Our advertising and promotional programs, in-store communications, and other design elements all help to communicate something about what makes Chipotle different from other fast food companies. Whether its engaging with our company via social media, participating in our local events or simply eating a burrito at one of our restaurants, each interaction with a customer affords us an important opportunity to build our brand.
Our advertising has generally included print, outdoor, transit and radio ads, but we are also incorporating online advertising into the mix, and adding strategic promotions that demonstrate how Chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts, or that connect us to like-minded individuals or organizations. Beyond these traditional means, we are exploring new avenues of branded and unbranded content aimed at educating consumers about issues that are important to us, and explaining why we are working to drive positive change in the nations food 6 Table of Contents supply. In addition, we continue to generate considerable media coverage, with scores of publications writing favorably about our food, restaurant concept and business, and our food, restaurants and company have been featured in a number of television programs.
We also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. To this end, we have been testing more owned media, including new video and music programs, and a more visible event strategy that includes the expansion of our Cultivate festivals of food, music and ideas, and participation in relevant events in markets around the country. Many of these newer programs allow us to tell our story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising, and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers. We are also increasing our use of digital, mobile, and social media to our overall marketing mix, giving customers greater opportunity to access Chipotle in ways that are convenient for them, and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually. Through our first ever customer loyalty program, the Farm Team, we are inviting our most loyal and passionate customers to join a program that educates them about many of the things that make Chipotle special, and rewards them for expanding and sharing their knowledge of our company.
Collectively, these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us create considerable word-of-mouth publicity, with our customers learning about us and telling others, allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures, even in a competitive category, and to differentiate Chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right things in every facet of our business.
Competition We compete with national and regional fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurants. Our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and in-store cafs of several major grocery store chains. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region, market and even restaurant. Competitors to our restaurants compete based on a number of factors, including taste, quality, speed of service, price and value, name recognition, location, menu variety, customer service and the ambience and condition of the competitor. Unlike us, a number of our competitors grow through franchising.
We believe were well-positioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends, including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared and the increasing prevalence of the fast-casual segment. Some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours. We believe, however, that Chipotle has become one of the most recognized fast-casual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food, as well as our commitment to Food With Integrity, which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate.
Restaurant Site Selection We believe that site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location. Our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets, taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers. Locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed on site by a team of development management and often leaders from operations as part of a formal site ride, as well as in a written real estate package. We study the surrounding trade area, demographic and business information within that area, and available information on competitors. Based on this analysis, including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas, we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment. We have been successful in a number of different types of locations, such as in-line or end-cap locations in strip or power centers, in regional malls and downtown business districts, free-standing buildings, and even an airport location. Our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience, including smaller or more economically mixed communities, highway sites, outlet centers, and restaurants in airports, food courts, or on military sites.
7 Table of Contents ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen We believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are basedfinding the very best sustainably raised ingredients, prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer, and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experiencecan be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at Chipotle. In order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food, we opened our first ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen during 2011. ShopHouse serves a menu that, like at Chipotle, is focused; main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls made with steak, chicken, meatballs made with pork and chicken, or tofu. Notwithstanding our opening of ShopHouse and our plans in 2013 to open another ShopHouse restaurant in Washington, D.C. and to introduce ShopHouse to the Los Angeles area, our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the Chipotle brand.
Seasonality Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year.
Our Intellectual Property and Trademarks Chipotle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Unburritable, Food With Integrity, Fresh Is Not Enough, Anymore, The Gourmet Restaurant Where You Eat With Your Hands, Responsibly Raised, ShopHouse and a number of related designs and logos are U.S. registered trademarks of Chipotle. We have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the U.S. In addition to our U.S. registrations, we have registered trademarks for Chipotle and a number of other marks in Canada, the European Union and various other countries, and have filed trademark applications for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chipotle and a number of other marks in various countries as well.
We also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress. From time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks, restaurant designs or advertising. Although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.
Information Systems Chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office. This system includes a point-of-sales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant. Additionally, the point-of-sales system is used to authorize, batch and transmit credit card transactions, to record employee time clock information, and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. We believe that our current point-of-sales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion. See Risk FactorsGeneral Business Risks We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information below for a discussion of certain risks associated with our point-of-sales systems.
Employees As of December31, 2012, we had about 37,310 employees, including about 3,020 salaried employees and about 34,290 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report includes statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. Forward-looking statements include our projections of the number of restaurants we expect to open in 2013, our expected comparable restaurant sales results during 2013, our expectations for food cost inflation and food costs as a percentage of revenue in 2013, statements about potential menu price increases in 2013, projections of restaurant development costs and other expenses, statements of our intention to open restaurants in one or more specified locations, statements regarding the potential impact of ongoing economic uncertainty on our business, statements about possible repurchases of our common stock, forecasts of marketing and promotional spending as a percentage of revenue in 2013, and our projections of our effective tax rate for 2013. We have used words such as may, will, should, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, believe, think, estimate, seek, expect, predict, could, project, potential and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, in this report to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties, risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such risks and other factors include those listed in this Item1A. Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this report.
When considering forward-looking statements in this report or that we make in other reports or statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and future reports we file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.
9 Table of Contents Risks Related to our Growth Strategy and Future Expansion Our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect, and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales or they may decrease.
While future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. We expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2013 to be flat or low single digit increases due to difficult comparisons and ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.
Our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending, including weaker consumer spending during periods of economic difficulty or uncertainty;  consumer understanding and acceptance of the Chipotle experience and perceptions of the Chipotle brand;  our ability to increase menu prices without adversely impacting transaction counts to such a degree that the impact from lower transactions equals or exceeds the benefit of the menu price increase;  any trade down by customers or other reduction in average check in response to price increases, which could reduce or eliminate the benefit of the price increase on comparable restaurant sales;  competition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry, or from our own restaurants in the event customers who frequent one of our restaurants begin to visit one of our new restaurants instead;  executing our strategies effectively, including our development strategy, our marketing and branding strategies, our initiatives to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer, expanded use of fax service lines and online and other electronic ordering, and introductions of catering options and new menu items, each of which we may not be able to accomplish or which may not have the impact we expect;  initial sales performance of new restaurants, which is subject to the risks described below under Our new restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants ;  weather, road construction and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and  changes in government regulation.
As a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control, and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2012 our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated, which we attribute in part to decreased consumer spending and economic uncertainty, and the price of our stock declined significantly in the wake of this deceleration, including a decline of nearly 22% on the trading day following our second quarter 2012 earnings release. Any future deceleration in or failure to meet market expectations for our comparable restaurant sales increases would likely result in another decline in the price of our common stock.
10 Table of Contents Increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants, which is subject to many unpredictable factors.
We operated 1,410 restaurants as of December31, 2012. We plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years, and plan to open between 165 and 180 new restaurants in 2013. However, we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors:  our potential inability to locate and secure new restaurant sites in locations that we believe to be attractive;  obstacles to hiring and training qualified operating personnel in the local market;  delay or cancellation of new site development by developers and landlords, which may become increasingly common during periods of economic uncertainty or tight credit;  difficulty managing construction and development costs of new restaurants at affordable levels, particularly in competitive markets;  difficulty negotiating leases with acceptable terms;  any shortages of construction materials and labor;  lack of availability of, or inability to obtain, adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards;  failures or delays in securing required governmental approvals (including construction, parking and other permits); and  the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.
One of our biggest challenges in opening new restaurants is staffing. We seek to hire only top-performing employees and to promote general managers from our crew, which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open. Constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry  Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders .
Another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites. Competition for suitable new restaurant sites in our target markets can be intense, and development and leasing costs are increasing, particularly for urban locations. These factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing economic uncertainty, as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results. Moreover, as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline, which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth.
Our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate, which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods. Similarly, our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant (as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants) may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits.
Our new restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants.
Historically, many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial ramp-up period typically lasting 24months or more, during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize. This is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area, higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other start-up inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants, and a larger 11 Table of Contents proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted. It may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards. If we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations, new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable. We also have lowered the average development cost for new Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. significantly in recent years, from about $916,000 in 2008 to about $800,000 in 2012. In the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2013 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years, which could result from inflation, project mismanagement or other reasons, our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability. Additionally, our new restaurant development activity has broadened recently to incorporate trade areas or restaurant sites in which we have little or no prior experience, including smaller or more economically mixed communities, highway sites, outlet centers, and restaurants in airports, food courts, or on military sites. The risks relating to building a customer base and managing development and operating costs may be more significant in some or all of these types of trade areas or restaurant sites.
In addition, we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the U.S. New restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previously-opened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newly-opened restaurant instead. This impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants, and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability. Existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newly-opened restaurants in the same market.
Our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas.
Some of our new restaurants are located in or planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience. For instance, over the past three years weve opened five restaurants in London and one restaurant in Paris, our first restaurants outside of North America, and during 2013 we plan to open an additional restaurant in London, an additional restaurant in Paris, and our first restaurant in Germany. New markets, particularly outside the U.S., may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. As a result, new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets. Consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the Chipotle brand, and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned. Due to lower consumer familiarity with the Chipotle brand in new markets, restaurants opened in these markets, particularly outside the U.S., may have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision, passion and culture. In addition, restaurants in new markets may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets, and may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us, either initially or over time, with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels, and may never do so, thereby affecting our overall profitability. Some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the U.S. due to cultural, regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar, which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results. Our overall results may also be affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar.
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen may not contribute to our growth.
We believe that the fundamental principles on which Chipotle restaurants are basedfinding the very best sustainably raised ingredients, prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer, and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experiencecan be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at Chipotle. In order to see how our model works when we use different 12 Table of Contents ingredients and a different style of food, we opened ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen during 2011. Notwithstanding our opening of ShopHouse and our plans in 2013 to open another ShopHouse restaurant in Washington D.C. and to introduce ShopHouse to the Los Angeles area, our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the Chipotle brand. As a result, we do not expect ShopHouse to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years, and we may determine not to move forward with any further expansion of ShopHouse. This might limit our overall growth over the long term.
Our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.
As described elsewhere in this report, our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain general managers and crew. We also are continuing to attempt to improve our field management in an effort to develop additional top-performing general managers more quickly. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management, crew and existing infrastructure, and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate. Changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants, and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability. We also place a lot of importance on our culture, which we believe has been an important contributor to our success. As we grow, we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. Our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results.
Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry Changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Like all restaurant companies, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, generalized infectious diseases, fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, product recalls and government regulations. The cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and soy oil, has increased markedly in some years, resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice, increasing our food costs. Food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly at various points during 2012 and we expect that there will be additional pricing pressures on some of those ingredients, including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and sour cream during 2013. We could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to meats raised in accordance with our sustainability and responsibility criteria or other food items we buy as part of our Food With Integrity focus, the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products. Weather related issues, such as freezes or drought, may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats. Any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as chicken, beef, cheese, avocados, beans, rice, tomatoes and pork, would adversely affect our operating results. Alternatively, in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items, such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients. Any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales.
Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders.
Labor is a primary component of our operating costs, and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our general managers and crew. Increased labor costs due to factors like additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs, including the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (discussed further under 13 Table of Contents  Regulatory and Legal Risks  Governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costsLabor and Employment Regulations.
), as well as competition, increased minimum wage requirements, and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs. Our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees, especially general managers and crew members. As we grow, we believe we will need to promote or hire additional top-performing field leaders to ensure we hire and motivate good managers and crew, and it may be difficult to identify and keep those field leaders. Our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings, result in higher employee turnover or erode our employee and restaurant cultures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates. Any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly.
Various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. This may subject us to fines or penalties, and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. For example, following an audit by the Department of Homeland Security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in Minnesota during 2010, we lost approximately 450 employees, resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations, including slower throughput, as we trained new employees, as well as some degree of negative publicity. We are currently undergoing a similar audit in Virginia and the District of Columbia, and in April 2011 we received notice from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Termination of a significant number of employees in those or other markets or across our company would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput, and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. Our financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.
Because we do not franchise, risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce, including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits, compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring, payment and termination of employees, and employee-related litigation, may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees.
Instances of food-borne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity, thereby resulting in a decline in our sales, and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat, produce or dairy we use to prepare our food.
Instances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, subject us to liability to affected customers, and could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry that adversely affects our sales. For instance, on a small number of occasions a Chipotle restaurant has been associated with customer illness, and on those occasions our sales have been adversely impacted, at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness. The risk of illnesses associated with our food might increase in connection with an expansion of our catering business or other situations in which our food is served in conditions we cannot control. If our customers become ill from food-borne or localized illnesses or attribute an illness to our food, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability.
14 Table of Contents In addition, reports linking nationwide or regional outbreaks of food-borne illnesses have caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu. Similarly, past outbreaks of E. coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains, Asian and European countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu, and incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as hepatitis A or norovirus) and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past, and could have in the future, an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients. If we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the Chipotle experience, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable. Customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability.
Competition could adversely affect us.
The fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant. Our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments, including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains. Many of our competitors offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. Among our main competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market Mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. In addition, our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets, and as we do so sales may decline in our previously-opened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newly-opened restaurant instead.
Several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates, better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences. Many of our competitors in the fast-casual and quick-service segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lower-cost, value meal menu options, a strategy we do not currently pursue. Our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition.
Moreover, we may also compete with companies outside the fast casual and quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry. For example, competitive pressures can come from deli sections and in-store cafs of several major grocery store chains, including those targeted at customers who want higher-quality food, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. These competitors may have, among other things, a more diverse menu, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have.
Any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits.
Failure to receive frequent deliveries of higher-quality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations.
Our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, inclement weather, a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of our ingredients, which could harm our operations. We have almost no long-term contracts with suppliers, and we have relied largely on the same third party distribution network as McDonalds Corporation, from which we separated in 2006. If any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. We currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients, including beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, and tortillas. Due to the unique nature of the products we receive 15 Table of Contents from our Food With Integrity suppliers and as described in more detail above, these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them. If we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants, which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu. If that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result, affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter. Our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe.
Changes in customer tastes and preferences, spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline.
Changes in customer preferences, general economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry. Our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns, including preferences regarding items such as calories, sodium, carbohydrates or fat. These changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods. Our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence, which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels. Negative consumer sentiment has been reported to be impacting the economy to various degrees since the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, and according to some forecasts will continue to do so during 2013. Our average restaurant sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty, which can be caused by various factors such as high unemployment, increasing taxes or other changes in fiscal or monetary policy, high gasoline prices, declining home prices, tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest. Any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family food away from home spending could cause our sales, operating results, profits, business or financial condition to decline. If we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends, we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate.
If we were to experience widespread difficulty renewing existing leases on favorable terms, our revenue or occupancy costs could be adversely affected.
We lease substantially all of the properties on which we operate restaurants, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years. Some leases are subject to renewal at fair market value, which could involve substantial increases and a smaller number expire without any renewal option. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins.
Regulatory and Legal Risks Governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs.
Employment and Immigration Regulations We are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome, and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, a number of lawsuits have been 16 Table of Contents filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime, meal and rest breaks, employee record-keeping and related practices with respect to our employees. We could suffer losses from, and we incur legal costs to defend, these or similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, and these increases could increase our labor costs.
We also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well, and recent audit activity and federal criminal and civil investigations in this area are described in more detail above under Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry  Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders . Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees. On the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents, or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, in addition to the criminal and civil investigations mentioned above under Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders , the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have informed us that they are conducting parallel investigations into possible criminal and civil securities law violations relating to our employee work authorization compliance and related disclosures and statements as well. All of the foregoing investigations will continue to be expensive and distracting, and could subject us to fines, reputational damage, and other liabilities that could be significant.
The comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. We are evaluating the impact the new law will have on us, and although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have, we expect that the requirement that we provide more extensive health benefits to employees than we currently do could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general. The most significant increase in costs will likely begin in 2014. Such increases will likely be large enough to materially impact our labor costs. Alternatively, if we choose not to provide the required health insurance or if some employees do not qualify for the required insurance, our employee culture may be harmed and we may face adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand.
Additionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possible passage of all or parts of the proposed Employee Free Choice Act, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence, and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.
Americans with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws We are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred substantial legal fees in connection with ADA-related complaints in the past, and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses associated with these modifications, or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.
17 Table of Contents Nutrition and Food Regulation In recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available. The U.S. health care reform law included nation-wide menu labeling and nutrition disclosure requirements as well, and our restaurants will be covered by these national requirements when they go into effect, which may be as early as 2013. Initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food, may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line, decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.
Local Licensure, Zoning and Other Regulation Each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.
Environmental Laws We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We have, however, conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by third-party operations. We believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party. If the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely, then under certain environmental laws, we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination, sometimes without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Any such liability could be material. Further, we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations. We also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws.
Other Aspects of Regulatory Risk From time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various laws and regulations that cover our business. The majority of this litigation occurs in California even though currently only about 17% of our restaurants are located there. As we continue to expand in California, or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in California, our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in, or minimized our operations in, California.
Because we do not franchise, the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business, as described above, may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees.
We could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies.
Were subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination, and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related 18 Table of Contents to these or different matters in the future. Our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that were responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. See Governmental regulation in one or more of the following areas may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harming our ability to open new restaurants or increasing our operating costs above, for additional discussion of these types of claims. From time to time, we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties. We believe the number of all of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers, particularly in California. We are also undergoing government investigations as described elsewhere in this report, including under Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry  Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants and the right field leaders.
Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether were ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.
Risks Related to our Unique Business Strategy We may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higher-quality food.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higher-quality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors, particularly those in the quick-service restaurant segment. We may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food, and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach. That could require us to change our pricing, advertising or promotional strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create. Consumers may also be more price-sensitive during periods of economic difficulty or uncertainty, and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases. Recent reports have indicated continued consumer uncertainty that may persist during 2013, so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future. If we do elect to increase menu prices, it may adversely impact our customer traffic.
Our Food With Integrity philosophy subjects us to risks.
The principle of Food With Integrity constitutes a significant part of our business strategy. We use a substantial amount of ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on practices we believe to be more sustainable or responsible than some conventional practices, and try to make food as fresh as we can. We do, however, face challenges associated with pursuing Food With Integrity. There are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality, sustainability and other responsible practices. Growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens, cattle and pigs that are not fed sub-therapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones. Crops grown organically or using other responsible practices can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower. It can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria for meat, dairy and produce ingredients. Given the costs associated with what we believe are more responsible farming practices, and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment, many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area. Although all of our restaurants generally serve meat from animals raised in accordance with criteria weve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare, we may experience shortages of meat, particularly chicken or steak, meeting these criteria due to suppliers suspending production, market conditions, or other forces beyond our control. A few of our markets have reverted to temporarily serving conventionally raised beef or chicken due to supply shortages, including for brief periods on a regional basis during 2012 and early 2013.Furthermore, as we grow, the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained. Moreover, we have 19 Table of Contents made a significant commitment to serving local or organic produce when seasonally available, and a small portion of our restaurants also serves produce purchased from farmers markets seasonally as well. These produce initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of food-borne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty of imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers. Quality variations and food-borne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of Food With Integrity or our brand generally.
If as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a cost-effective basis, our food costs could increase, adversely impacting our operating margins. These factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with Food With Integrity, which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline. Our commitment to Food With Integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our Food With Integrity approach. Any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants. We may also face adverse publicity or liability for false advertising claims if suppliers, without our knowledge, do not adhere to all of the elements of our Food With Integrity programs, such as responsible meat protocols, requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods, and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions. If any such supplier failures are publicized, our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted.
Additionally, in response to increasing customer awareness and demand, some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, dairy products from cows not treated with rBGH, and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our Food With Integrity philosophy. If competitors become known for using these types of higher-quality or more sustainable ingredients, it could further limit our supply of these ingredients, and may make it more difficult for us to differentiate Chipotle and our restaurants, which could adversely impact our operating results.
Our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
Our Chairman and co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells founded our company, has been the principal architect of our business strategy, and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1,400 restaurants today. Monty Moran, our co-Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Hartung, our Chief Financial Officer, have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or a new management team were to change or be unsuccessful in implementing our strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.
Our marketing and advertising strategies may not be successful, which could adversely impact our business.
We have developed a marketing and advertising strategy that we believe is unique in the restaurant industry. We have not generally advertised on television and engage in very limited price or value-based promotions. Instead we invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will increase customers connection with our brand. If these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant sales, the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable restaurant sales we expect. In addition, our marketing has increasingly incorporated elements intended to encourage customers to question sources or production methods commonly used to produce food. These elements of our marketing could alienate food suppliers and may potentially lead to an increased risk of disputes or litigation if suppliers or other constituencies believe our marketing is unfair or misleading. Increased costs in connection with any such issues, or any deterioration in our relationships with existing suppliers, could adversely impact us.
20 Table of Contents General Business Risks We may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information.
We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2012 approximately 62% of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions, and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase. A number of retailers, including us, have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. In August2004, the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data. As a result, we recorded losses and related expenses totaling $4.3 million from 2004 through 2006.
We may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.
We also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels, and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we or such third parties otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.
Our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims.
We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability, property damage and auto liability. We are self-insured for our health plans, and have purchased a fully-insured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs.We are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers compensation, general liability, property damage and auto liability insurance.
For policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. If a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we estimated, or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.
Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos, our Food With Integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have 21 Table of Contents a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items, logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property, and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future. We may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs.
Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors.
Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors, including:  changes in comparable restaurant sales and customer visits, including as a result of declining consumer confidence or the introduction of new menu items;  the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses;  operating costs at newly opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation;  labor availability and wages of restaurant management and crew, as well as temporary fluctuations in labor costs as a result of large-scale changes in workforce;  fluctuations in supply costs, particularly for our most significant food items;  our ability to raise menu prices without adversely impacting customer traffic;  the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities, such as freezes that have impacted produce crops;  variations in general economic conditions, including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income;  negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at our restaurants;  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;  increases in infrastructure costs;  tax expenses, impairment charges and other non-operating costs; and  potential distraction or unusual expenses associated with our expansion into international markets or initiatives to explore new concepts.
Seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather (because fewer people are eating out) and higher during the spring, summer and fall months (for the opposite reason). Our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading daysthat is, the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open.
As a result of these factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to fall. We believe the market price of our common stock, which has generally traded at a higher price-earnings ratio than stocks of most or all of our peer companies, reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. As a result, if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future, any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant.
22 Table of Contents Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from McDonalds could adversely affect us.
McDonalds Corporation was our majority owner from 2000 until October 2006. We understand that the exchange offer McDonalds completed in October 2006 to dispose of its interest in us was generally tax-free to McDonalds and its shareholders. In order to protect the tax-free status of the exchange offer, in the separation agreement we entered into with McDonalds in connection with the separation we agreed among other things to indemnify McDonalds for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the exchange failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction in certain situations, if the taxes and related losses are attributable to (i)certain direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets (regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions); (ii)negotiations, understandings, agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions; or (iii)any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that affects the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our common stock. In December 2009, following completion of an extensive due diligence process, we completed a share conversion eliminating the existence of our class B common stock, and with it the superior voting rights of the class B common stock. In the event the share conversion is deemed to result in the McDonalds exchange offer failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction, we may have an indemnification obligation under the provision described above. We currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to McDonalds could exceed $450 million, and this estimate does not take into account related losses and depends upon several factors that are beyond our control. As a consequence, the indemnity to McDonalds could vary substantially from the estimate and may be much greater.
Our anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Certain provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult, including provisions relating to the nomination, election and removal of directors, the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders. In addition, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Any of these provisions, as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with McDonalds described above under Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from McDonalds could adversely affect us, may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item6. Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations.

Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast-food experience. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customerfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Through our vision of Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that where possible are sustainably and responsibly grown and raised with respect to the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. A similarly focused people culture, with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees, enables us to develop future leaders from within.
2012 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development . As of December31, 2012, we had 1,410 restaurants, of which 1,399 were located throughout the United States, five were located in Canada, five were located in London, England, and one was located in Paris, France. Our restaurants include one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, a restaurant serving Asian-inspired cuisine. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth and we opened 183 restaurants in 2012, and expect to open between 165 and 180 restaurants in 2013, including any new ShopHouse restaurants.
Sales Growth . Average restaurant sales were $2.113 million as of December31, 2012, increasing from $2.013 million as of December31, 2011. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12-month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 7.1% in 2012. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation. Comparable restaurant sales increases in 2012 were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits as well as the impact of menu price increases. We implemented menu price increases in our Pacific region during the first quarter of both 2012 and 2011, and in our remaining regions during the summer of 2011, and as a result, menu price increases benefitted comparable restaurant sales by 2.8% in 2012. Taking into account the loss of the benefit of menu price increases and our recent transaction trends, as well as ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty, we expect 2013 comparable restaurant sales to be flat or low single digit increases assuming we do not increase menu prices.
Food With Integrity.
In all of our restaurants, we endeavor to serve only meats that were raised without the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics or added hormones, and in accordance with criteria weve established in an effort to improve sustainability and promote animal welfare.In addition, a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown, or sourced locally when in season (by which we mean within 350 miles of our restaurant), and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions, reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown. The sour cream and cheese we buy is made with milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH. Milk used to make much of our cheese and some of our sour cream is sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing outdoor access for their cows.We will continue to search for quality ingredients that not only taste delicious, but also benefit local farmers or the environment, or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain.
29 Table of Contents One of our primary goals is for all of our restaurants to continue serving meats that are raised to meet our standards, but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised beef for short periods during 2012 and the beginning of 2013, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints. When we become aware that one or more of our restaurants will serve conventionally raised meat, we clearly and specifically disclose this temporary change on signage in each affected restaurant, so that customers can avoid those meats if they choose to do so.
Our food costs increased in 2012 as a result of inflationary pressures on many of our ingredients, particularly beef, chicken, and rice, and initiatives to improve the taste and quality of our food. The increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases and relief in avocado prices. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2013 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase. If food inflation continues to pressure food costs, we may, after taking into account the general economic environment, consumer confidence, and our sales trends, raise menu prices later in 2013.
Stock Repurchases.
In accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of $206.4 million during 2012. As of December31, 2012, $100.2 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorizations, which were announced on October18, 2012 and November20, 2012. On February5, 2013 we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5-1(c), authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The existing repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchases may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
On November20, 2012, we also entered into a privately negotiated accelerated share repurchase transaction (ASR) to repurchase $25 million of our common stock. The $25 million is part of the $100 million repurchase program announced on November20, 2012. We advanced the $25 million upon commencement of the transaction and received 65,187 shares, which represented 70% of the total number of shares to be repurchased calculated using the closing price on the commencement date. The final number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR will be determined based generally on the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over a specified period. The ASR will be completed during the first quarter of 2013.
Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated.
For the years ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Beginning of year 1,230 1,084 956 Openings 183 150 129 Relocations (3 ) (4 ) (1 ) Total restaurants at end of year 1,410 1,230 1,084 Results of Operations Our results of operations as a percentage of revenue and period-over-period variances are discussed in the following section. As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase.
30 Table of Contents Revenue For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012over 2011 % increase 2011over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 2,731.2 $ 2,269.5 $ 1,835.9 20.3 % 23.6 % Average restaurant sales $ 2.113 $ 2.013 $ 1.840 5.0 % 9.4 % Comparable restaurant sales increases 7.1 % 11.2 % 9.4 % Number of restaurants as of the end of the period 1,410 1,230 1,084 14.6 % 13.5 % Number of restaurants opened in the period, net of relocations 180 146 128 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $304.7 million of the increase in sales in 2012, of which $134.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2011, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $237.9 million of the increase in sales, of which $92.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2011.
Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed $156.4 million and $195.6 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales growth in 2012 and 2011 was due primarily to increases in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases.
Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012 over 2011 % increase 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 891.0 $ 738.7 $ 561.1 20.6 % 31.7 % As a percentage of revenue 32.6 % 32.5 % 30.6 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 due to inflation on many food items, primarily beef, chicken, and rice, and initiatives to improve the taste and quality of our food. The increase was partially offset by the impact of menu price increases, and relief in avocado prices. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2013 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase.
Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflation on most food items, including avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy, partially offset by the impact of menu price increases.
Labor Costs For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012 over 2011 % increase 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 641.8 $ 543.1 $ 453.6 18.2 % 19.7 % As a percentage of revenue 23.5 % 23.9 % 24.7 % Labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2012 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales, including the impact of menu price increases, partially offset by increased average wage rates.
31 Table of Contents Labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2011 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales, including the impact of menu price increases, partially offset by increased average wage rates, as well as labor inefficiencies.
Occupancy Costs For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012over 2011 % increase 2011over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 171.4 $ 147.3 $ 128.9 16.4 % 14.2 % As a percentage of revenue 6.3 % 6.5 % 7.0 % Occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 and in 2011 primarily due to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base.
Other Operating Costs For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012 over 2011 % increase 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 286.6 $ 251.2 $ 202.9 14.1 % 23.8 % As a percentage of revenue 10.5 % 11.1 % 11.1 % Other operating costs include, among other items, marketing and promotional costs, bank and credit card fees, and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs. Other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2012 due primarily to the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue. We expect marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2013.
Other operating costs remained consistent as a percentage of revenue in 2011. The benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base and lower marketing and promotional spend as a percentage of revenue was offset by increased credit card fees resulting from a higher percentage of customers using credit cards, as well as increased maintenance of restaurants as they age and general inflationary pressures.
General and Administrative Expenses For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012 over 2011 % increase 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 183.4 $ 149.4 $ 118.6 22.7 % 26.0 % As a percentage of revenue 6.7 % 6.6 % 6.5 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2012 primarily resulted from an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to awards granted in 2012 with a higher stock price on the date of grant and additional expense related to non-vested stock awards subject to performance conditions, and costs from our biennial All Managers Conference which we held during the year.
The increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms in 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to awards granted in 2011 with a significantly higher stock price on the date of grant as well as hiring more employees as we grew. These increases were partially offset by costs from the biennial All Managers Conference held during the third quarter of 2010.
32 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012 over 2011 % increase 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 84.1 $ 74.9 $ 68.9 12.3 % 8.7 % As a percentage of revenue 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.8 % As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization decreased in 2012 and 2011 as a result of the benefit of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base.
Income Tax Provision For the years ended December 31 % increase 2012 over 2011 % increase 2011 over 2010 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 179.7 $ 134.8 $ 110.1 33.3 % 22.4 % Effective tax rate 39.3 % 38.5 % 38.1 % The 2012 effective tax rate increased from 2011 primarily due to expiration of certain federal credits, a smaller benefit from food donations, and higher foreign losses which we are not yet able to recognize. The increase was partially offset by prior period adjustments. The 2012 effective tax rate would have been lower by approximately 0.5% if certain federal credits that will be realized in the 2012 tax return had been recognized. Because these credits were authorized by Congress in January 2013, the benefit of the credits will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013. We estimate our 2013 annual effective tax rate will be 38.5%, including 0.5% estimated benefit related to the 2012 reinstated federal tax benefits.
The 2011 effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in the state rate, smaller benefit from food donations and one-time adjustments partially offset by the one-time employment tax credits.
Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December31, 2012. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.
2012 Quarters Ended March31 June30 September30 December31 Revenue $ 640.6 $ 690.9 $ 700.5 $ 699.2 Operating income $ 102.2 $ 133.8 $ 117.7 $ 102.2 Net income $ 62.7 $ 81.7 $ 72.3 $ 61.4 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 32 55 36 60 Comparable restaurant sales increase 12.7 % 8.0 % 4.8 % 3.8 % 2011 Quarters Ended March31 June30 September30 December31 Revenue $ 509.4 $ 571.6 $ 591.9 $ 596.7 Operating income $ 74.8 $ 83.9 $ 98.0 $ 93.9 Net income $ 46.4 $ 50.7 $ 60.4 $ 57.5 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 12 39 32 67 Comparable restaurant sales increase 12.4 % 10.0 % 11.3 % 11.1 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of 33 Table of Contents mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results.
Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short-term investment balance of $472.9 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions (including up to $100.2 million in repurchases under programs authorized as of December31, 2012), to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We also have a long term investments balance of $190.9 million, which consists of U.S. treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
We havent required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. Our total capital expenditures for 2012 were $197.0 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $210 million in 2013, of which $160 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2012, for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S., we spent on average about $800,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, net of landlord reimbursements, and about $820,000, net of landlord reimbursements, for all restaurants including international locations. For new restaurants to be opened in 2013, we anticipate average development costs will be similar to 2012.
Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December31, 2012 were as follows: 2012 Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 2,466,303 $ 158,981 $ 323,013 $ 325,962 $ 1,658,347 Deemed landlord financing $ 5,505 $ 394 $ 795 $ 844 $ 3,472 Other contractual obligations (1) $ 126,218 $ 125,106 $ 1,082 $ 30 $  Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,598,026 $ 284,481 $ 324,890 $ 326,836 $ 1,661,819 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under construction contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders related to produce and other ingredients, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.
34 Table of Contents Were obligated under non-cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five-year extensions, for end-cap and in-line restaurants, or 15 to 20years with several five-year extensions, for free-standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December31, 2012 and 2011, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, healthcare costs, labor, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases.
Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note1 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or SOSARs, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. Similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards and SOSARs with performance-based vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance SOSARs. We determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. Those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our SOSARs, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance SOSARs, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.
35 Table of Contents Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for workers compensation, general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as $1 million, and for property which generally has a $1.5 million deductible. We are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. The total estimated insurance liabilities as of December31, 2012 were $27.8 million.
Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December31, 2012 and 2011. Although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate, and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability. As a result, in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved, such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows.
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December31, 2012, we had $470.8 million in investments and interest-bearing cash accounts, including an insurance related restricted trust account classified in other assets, and $199.4 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.33%.
Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. However, a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. Generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase, or if menu price increases result in customer resistance.
36 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the U.S. and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollar and share amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified) 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Chipotle Mexican Grill,Inc. (the Company), a Delaware corporation, develops and operates fast-casual, fresh Mexican food restaurants throughout the United States. The Company also has five restaurants in Canada, five in London, England, and one in Paris, France. Further, the Company operates one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, serving fast-casual, Asian inspired cuisine. The Company manages its operations based on six regions and has aggregated its operations to one reportable segment.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold. The Company reports revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities.
The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the Company determines the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company revised its estimated breakage rate from 5% to 4% of gift card sales. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a six month period beginning at the date of the gift card sale. Gift card breakage is included in revenue in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. Breakage recognized during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $2,070, $1,524 and $1,188, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable primarily consists of tenant improvement receivables, payroll-related tax receivables, receivables from third party gift card distributors, vendor rebates, and receivables arising from the normal course of business. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable based on a specific review of account balances. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recoverability is considered remote.
44 Table of Contents Inventory Inventory, consisting principally of food, beverages, and supplies, is valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. Certain key ingredients (beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, and tortillas) are purchased from a small number of suppliers.
Investments The Companys investments consist of U.S. treasury notes and CDARS, certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service, with maturities up to approximately two years and classified as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which the Company has determined approximates fair value as of December31, 2012 and 2011. Fair market value of U.S. treasury notes is measured on a recurring basis based on Level 1 inputs and fair market value of CDARS is measured on a recurring basis based on Level 2 inputs (level inputs are described below under Fair Value Measurements). The Company recognizes impairment charges on its investments in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income when management believes the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary. No impairment charges were recognized on the Companys investments for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
Leasehold Improvements, Property and Equipment Leasehold improvements, property and equipment are recorded at cost. Internal costs directly associated with the acquisition, development and construction of a restaurant are capitalized and were $10,038, $9,616 and $8,167 for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, which generally includes reasonably assured option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the accounts are relieved of cost and accumulated depreciation and the related gain or loss, if any, is reflected in loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
At least annually, the Company evaluates, and adjusts when necessary, the estimated useful lives. The changes in estimated useful lives did not have a material impact on depreciation in any period. The estimated useful lives are: Leasehold improvements and buildings 3-20years Furniture and fixtures 4-10years Equipment 3-7 years Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of the business acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, and the Company is required to record any necessary impairment adjustments. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill. Based on the Companys analysis, no impairment charges were recognized on goodwill for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of restricted cash assets of $24,799 and $15,313 as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, a rabbi trust as described further in Note 6, transferable liquor licenses which are carried at the lower of fair value or cost, and a prepaid tax asset related to an intercompany transfer of international intellectual property. Restricted cash assets are primarily related to insurance related restricted trust assets.
45 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment, assets are grouped together at the market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, an aggregate impairment charge of $0, $380 and $751, respectively, was recognized in loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. The impairment charges resulted primarily from office or restaurant closures or relocations. Fair value of the restaurants was determined using Level 3 inputs (as described below under Fair Value Measurements) based on a discounted cash flows method at a market level through the estimated date of closure.
Income Taxes The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. The deferred income tax impacts of investment tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. When it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, the Company provides a corresponding valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. When it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company measures the amount of tax benefit from the position and records the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized after settlement with a tax authority. The Companys policy is to recognize interest to be paid on an underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and any related statutory penalties in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
Restaurant Pre-Opening Costs Pre-opening costs, including rent, wages, benefits and travel for the training and opening teams, food and other restaurant operating costs, are expensed as incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business.
Insurance Liability The Company maintains various insurance policies including workers compensation, employee health, general liability, automobile, and property damage. Pursuant to these policies, the Company is responsible for losses up to certain limits and is required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. This liability is based on managements estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and, where applicable, claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. If actual trends differ from the estimates, the financial results could be impacted. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, $22,540 and $17,437, respectively, of the estimated liability was included in accrued payroll and benefits and $5,220 and $4,250, respectively, was included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Advertising and Marketing Costs Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $34,999, $31,902 and $26,190 for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Advertising and marketing costs are included in other operating costs in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.
46 Table of Contents Rent Rent expense for the Companys leases, which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term is the lesser of 20 years inclusive of reasonably assured renewal periods, or the lease term. The lease term begins when the Company has the right to control the use of the property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the lease. The difference between the rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheet. Pre-opening rent is included in pre-opening costs in the consolidated income statement. Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions of rent expense over the term of the lease.
Additionally, certain of the Companys operating leases contain clauses that provide additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. The Company recognizes contingent rent expense provided the achievement of that target is considered probable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.
Fair Value Measurements Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 820, Fair Value of Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) defines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
Foreign Currency Translation The Companys international operations generally use the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and investments. Approximately half of the Companys cash and investment balances are not federally backed or federally insured. Credit card transactions at the Companys restaurant are processed by one service provider.
47 Table of Contents Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements through the date of issuance.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Effective October1, 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2012-02 Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. ASU 2012-02 simplifies how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The adoption of ASU 2012-02 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Effective January1, 2012, the Company adopted ASU No.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 concerns presentation and disclosure only and did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Effective January1, 2012, the Company adopted ASU No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
2. Supplemental Financial Information Leasehold improvements, property and equipment were as follows: December31 2012 2011 Land $ 11,062 $ 11,062 Leasehold improvements and buildings 996,080 849,102 Furniture and fixtures 100,416 89,180 Equipment 204,062 172,776 1,311,620 1,122,120 Accumulated depreciation (444,917 ) (370,169 ) $ 866,703 $ 751,951 Accrued liabilities were as follows: December31 2012 2011 Gift card liability $ 22,736 $ 18,012 Transaction tax payable 13,499 12,121 Other accrued expenses 20,043 16,323 $ 56,278 $ 46,456 48 Table of Contents 3. Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: Years ended December31 2012 2011 2010 Current tax: U.S. Federal $ 166,386 $ 100,983 $ 83,850 U.S. State 31,231 21,848 15,745 Foreign 125 (6 ) 6 197,742 122,825 99,601 Deferred tax: U.S. Federal (16,024 ) 12,080 10,058 U.S. State (2,013 ) (50 ) 6 Foreign (1,578 ) (711 )  (19,615 ) 11,319 10,064 Valuation allowance 1,558 616 415 Provision for income taxes $ 179,685 $ 134,760 $ 110,080 Actual taxes paid for each tax period were less than the current tax expense due to the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation of $73,210, $38,786, and $14,526 during the years ended December31 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rates as follows: YearsendedDecember31 2012 2011 2010 Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of related federal income tax benefit 4.1 4.1 3.5 Federal credits  (0.8 ) (0.4 ) Other 0.2 0.2  Effective income tax rates 39.3 % 38.5 % 38.1 % In January 2013, the United States Congress authorized, and the President signed into law, certain federal tax credits that can be reflected in the Companys U.S. tax return for 2012; however, since this law was enacted in 2013, the financial statement benefit of such credits cannot be reflected until the first quarter of 2013. The lack of availability of such credits caused the 2012 effective tax rate to be approximately 0.5% higher than it would have been had the credits been approved in 2012.
Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These temporary differences consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
49 Table of Contents Deferred income tax liabilities are taxes the Company expects to pay in future periods. Similarly, deferred income tax assets are recorded for expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods. Deferred income taxes arise because of the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities and assets consist of the following: December31 2012 2011 Long-term deferred income tax liability: Leasehold improvements, property and equipment $ 136,040 $ 127,706 Goodwill and other assets 1,166 990 Total long-term deferred income tax liability 137,206 128,696 Long-term deferred income tax asset: Deferred rent 41,041 35,645 Gift card liability 480 373 Capitalized transaction costs 505 504 Stock-based compensation and other employee benefits 46,515 28,079 Foreign net operating loss carry-forwards 2,992 1,397 Other 72  Valuation allowance (3,346 ) (1,683 ) Total long-term deferred income tax asset 88,259 64,315 Net long-term deferred income tax liability 48,947 64,381 Current deferred income tax liability: Prepaid assets and other 2,086 1,982 Total current deferred income tax liability 2,086 1,982 Current deferred income tax asset: Allowances, reserves and other 10,433 8,094 Other employee benefits 573 234 Valuation allowance (58 ) (108 ) Total current deferred income tax asset 10,948 8,220 Net current deferred income tax asset 8,862 6,238 Total deferred income tax liability $ 40,085 $ 58,143 As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. There was no change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the year or in prior periods or due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapses of applicable statutes of limitations. The Company is open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2009. For the majority of states where the Company has a significant presence, it is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2008. The Companys foreign net operating losses begin expiring in 2015.
4. Shareholders Equity Through December31, 2012, the Company had announced authorizations by its Board of Directors of six separate plans to repurchase shares of common stock, which in the aggregate authorized expenditures of up to $600 million. The shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions.
On November20, 2012 the Company entered into a privately negotiated accelerated share repurchase transaction (ASR) to repurchase $25,000 of its common stock. The Company advanced $25,000 on 50 Table of Contents November20, 2012 and received 65 shares, which represented 70% of the total number of shares to be repurchased calculated using the closing price on November20, 2012. The final number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR will be determined on the volume-weighted average share price of the Companys common stock over a specified period. The ASR will be completed during the first quarter of 2013.
The shares of common stock repurchased under authorized programs, including the ASR, were 686, 220 and 828 for a total cost of $206,394, $63,508 and $115,885 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December31, 2012, $100,179 was available to be repurchased under the authorized programs. Treasury shares totaling 3,819 are being held in treasury until such time as they are reissued or retired, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
On February5, 2013, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of common stock.
During 2012 and 2010, shares of common stock were netted and surrendered as payment for applicable tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of outstanding stock awards. Shares surrendered by the participants in accordance with the applicable award agreements and plan are deemed repurchased by the Company but are not part of publicly announced share repurchase programs. In the year ended 2012, the Company repurchased 28 shares for a total cost of $10,698, and in the year ended 2010, the Company repurchased 67 shares for a total cost of $10,717.
5. Stock Based Compensation The Company issues shares pursuant to the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Incentive Plan). Shares issued prior to the 2011 Incentive Plan were issued subject to previous stock plans. For purposes of counting the shares remaining available under the 2011 Incentive Plan, each share issuable pursuant to outstanding full value awards, such as restricted stock units and performance shares, will count as two shares used, whereas each share underlying a stock appreciation right or stock option will count as one share used. Under the 2011 Incentive Plan, 3,360 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees, of which 2,760 represent shares that were authorized for issuance but not issued at December31, 2012. The 2011 Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which has the authority to select the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to determine the type of awards and when the awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each award, the vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of the awards. The exercise price for stock awards granted under the 2011 Incentive Plan cannot be less than fair market value at the date of grant.
The Company granted stock options prior to 2008, and has granted stock only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs) since that time. SOSARs vest equally over two and three years and expire after seven years. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion. Compensation expense related to employees eligible to retire and retain full rights to the awards is recognized over six months which coincides with the notice period. Compensation expense on performance shares, which is based on the quantity of awards the Company has determined are probable of vesting, is recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense, including options, SOSARs and stock awards, was $66,274 ($40,361 net of tax) in 2012, $42,965 ($26,166 net of tax) in 2011 and $22,280 ($13,713 net of tax) in 2010. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company increased its estimate of the number of non-vested stock awards subject to performance conditions that are probable of vesting, which resulted in a cumulative adjustment to expense of $5,578 ($3,397 net of tax and $0.11 impact to basic and diluted earnings per share for 2012). For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, $1,998, $1,583 and $899, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense was recognized as capitalized development and is included in leasehold improvements, property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet.

The total intrinsic value of options and SOSARs exercised during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $183,097, $113,752 and $32,957. Unearned compensation as of December31, 2012 was $40,752 for options and SOSAR awards, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.

The quantity of shares that ultimately vest is determined based on the cumulative cash flow from operations reached during the three year period ending on September30, 2013. If the cumulative cash flow from operations during the three year period does not reach a specified level, no shares will vest. Unearned compensation as of December31, 2012 was $6,671 for non-vested stock awards the Company has determined are probable of vesting, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.7 years. The fair value of shares earned as of the vesting date during the year ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $31,309, $961, and $25,369, respectively.

The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury rates for instruments with similar terms. The volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data.
6. Employee Benefit Plans The Company maintains the Chipotle Mexican Grill 401(k) plan (the 401(k) Plan). The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed. Employees become eligible to receive matching contributions after one year of service with the Company. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Company matching contributions totaled approximately $2,431, $2,039 and $1,734, respectively.
In February 2012, the Company began offering an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Under the ESPP, 250 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees. Employees become eligible to contribute after one year of service with the Company and may contribute up to 15% of their base earnings, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount, toward the monthly purchase of the Companys common stock. During 2012, there were 1 shares issued under the ESPP.
The Company also maintains the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Supplemental Deferred Investment Plan (the Deferred Plan) which covers eligible employees of the Company. The Deferred Plan is a non-qualified plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions that cannot be made under the 401(k) Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. Participants earnings on contributions made to the Deferred Plan fluctuate with the actual earnings and losses of a variety of available investment choices selected by the participant. Total liabilities under the Deferred Plan as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were $10,037 and $6,802, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed once the 401(k) contribution limits are reached. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company made deferred compensation matches of $213, $179 and $156 respectively, to the Deferred Plan.
Prior to the first quarter of 2012, the Deferred Plan was unfunded, with all earnings and losses recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. The total expense recognized related to the unfunded portion of the Deferred Plan including the matching contributions was $487, $20 and $610 for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company elected to fund its deferred compensation obligations through a rabbi trust. The rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but the assets held in the rabbi trust are not available for general corporate purposes. Amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, as selected by participants, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Fair value of mutual funds is measured using Level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets), and the fair value of the investments in the rabbi trust was $10,037 as of December31, 2012. The Company records trading gains and losses in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income, along with the offsetting amount related to the increase or decrease in deferred compensation to reflect its exposure of the Deferred Plan liability. The Company recorded $240 of unrealized gains on investments held in the rabbi trust during twelve months ended December31, 2012.
53 Table of Contents 7. Leases The Company generally operates its restaurants in leased premises. Lease terms for traditional shopping center or building leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 20-25years. Ground leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 30-40years. The option terms in each of these leases are typically in five-year increments. Typically, the lease includes rent escalation terms every five years including fixed rent escalations, escalations based on inflation indexes, and fair market value adjustments. Certain leases contain contingent rental provisions based upon the sales of the underlying restaurants. The leases generally provide for the payment of common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance and various other use and occupancy costs by the Company. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices.
Future minimum lease payments required under existing operating leases as of December31, 2012 are as follows: 2013 $ 158,981 2014 161,042 2015 161,971 2016 162,451 2017 163,511 Thereafter 1,658,347 Total minimum lease payments $ 2,466,303 Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $6,099 due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.
Rental expense consists of the following: For the years ended December31 2012 2011 2010 Minimum rentals $ 152,935 $ 130,827 $ 114,750 Contingent rentals $ 1,917 $ 1,754 $ 1,602 Sublease rental income $ (1,623 ) $ (1,390 ) $ (1,227 ) The Company has six sales and leaseback transactions. These transactions do not qualify for sale leaseback accounting because of the Companys deemed continuing involvement with the buyer-lessor due to fixed price renewal options, which results in the transaction being recorded under the financing method. Under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds from the transactions are recorded as a financing liability. A portion of lease payments are applied as payments of deemed principal and imputed interest. The deemed landlord financing liability was $3,529 as of December31, 2012. The future minimum lease payments for each of the next five years and thereafter for deemed landlord financing obligations are as follows: 2013 $ 394 2014 394 2015 401 2016 421 2017 423 Thereafter 3,472 Total minimum lease payments 5,505 Less: Interest implicit in lease (1,976 ) Total deemed landlord financing $ 3,529 54 Table of Contents 8. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) is calculated using income available to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive securities include shares of common stock underlying stock options, SOSARs and non-vested stock awards. Diluted EPS considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. SOSARs to purchase 360, 240 and 340 shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of 2012, 2011 and 2010 diluted EPS, respectively, because they were anti-dilutive. In addition, 449, 224 and 60 stock awards subject to performance conditions were excluded from the 2012, 2011 and 2010 calculations of diluted EPS. The following table sets forth the computations of basic and dilutive earnings per share: Year ended December31 2012 2011 2010 Net income $ 278,000 $ 214,945 $ 178,981 Shares: Weighted average number of common shares outstanding 31,513 31,217 31,234 Dilutive stock options and SOSARs 254 497 422 Dilutive non-vested stock awards 16 61 79 Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding 31,783 31,775 31,735 Basic earnings per share $ 8.82 $ 6.89 $ 5.73 Diluted earnings per share $ 8.75 $ 6.76 $ 5.64 9. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The Company enters into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, commitment for food purchases, and corporate sponsorships. As of December31, 2012, total purchase obligations were $126,218.
Litigation California ADA Cases In 2006, Maurizio Antoninetti filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, primarily claiming that the height of the serving line wall in the Companys restaurants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, as well as California disability laws. On December6, 2006, Mr.Antoninetti filed an additional lawsuit in the same court making the same allegations on a class action basis, on behalf of himself and a purported class of disabled individuals, and a similar class action was filed by James Perkins in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May7, 2008.
In the individual Antoninetti action, the district court entered a ruling in which it found that although the Companys counter height violated the ADA, the Company provided the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation, and awarded attorneys fees and minimal damages to the plaintiff. The Company and the plaintiff appealed the district courts ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on July26, 2010, the appeals court entered a ruling finding that the Company violated the ADA and did not provide the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation, and remanded the case to the district court. On March21, 2012, the district court reaffirmed its original award of minimal damages to the plaintiff and denied further injunctive relief. On July18, 2012, the district court ordered a final judgment awarding the plaintiff a portion of the attorneys fees and costs originally sought, and on December26, 2012, the court of appeals awarded the plaintiff additional attorneys fees and costs for the appellate portion of the case.
55 Table of Contents In the purported class action cases, on August28, 2012, the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification. As a result, each plaintiff may only pursue claims against the Company in those cases on an individual basis. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision on class certification, which was denied by the court on January14, 2013.
The Company lowered the height of its serving line walls throughout California some time ago, which makes injunctive relief in these cases moot, and has the lower serving line walls in a significant majority of the Companys restaurants outside of California as well. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the ongoing class action cases. Due to the possibility of further appeals and the uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate any additional potential liability from those cases.
Notices of Inspection of Work Authorization Documents and Related Civil and Criminal Investigations Following an inspection during 2010 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, of the work authorization documents of the Companys restaurant employees in Minnesota, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm of DHS, or ICE, issued to the Company a Notice of Suspect Documents identifying a large number of employees who, according to ICE and notwithstanding the Companys review of work authorization documents for each employee at the time they were hired, appeared not to be authorized to work in the U.S. The Company approached each of the named employees to explain ICEs determination and afforded each employee an opportunity to confirm the validity of their original work eligibility documents, or provide valid work eligibility documents. Employees who were unable to provide valid work eligibility documents were terminated in accordance with the law. In December 2010, the Company was also requested by DHS to provide the work authorization documents of restaurant employees in the District of Columbia and Virginia, and the Company provided the requested documents in January 2011. The Company has received additional requests for work authorization documents covering a small number of individual restaurants as well, and ICEs investigation remains ongoing. In April 2011, the Company also received notice from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division. The operating hours of the Companys Minnesota, D.C. and Virginia restaurants have been uninterrupted by these developments, and the Company believes its practices with regard to the work authorization of its employees, including the review and retention of work authorization documents, are in compliance with applicable law. However, the termination of large numbers of employees in a short period of time does disrupt restaurant operations and results in a temporary increase in labor costs as new employees are trained.
In May 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notified the Company that it is conducting a civil investigation of the Companys compliance with employee work authorization verification requirements and its related disclosures and statements, and the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia advised the Company that its investigation has broadened to include a parallel criminal and civil investigation of the Companys compliance with federal securities laws.
The Company intends to continue to fully cooperate in the governments investigations. It is not possible at this time to determine whether the Company will incur any fines, penalties or further liabilities in connection with these matters.
Shareholder Derivative Actions On July12, 2012, Ralph B. Richey filed a shareholder derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado alleging that the members of the Companys Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with employee work authorization compliance matters. On September21, 2012, Joanne Nelson filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court alleging that the members of the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys Chief Financial Officer breached their fiduciary duties, caused waste of corporate assets, and were unjustly enriched in connection with employee work authorization compliance matters, as well as in connection with the Companys alleged failure to disclose material information about the Companys business results and prospects, and in connection with compensation paid to some of the Companys 56 Table of Contents officers. On October4, 2012, Francis Schmitz filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court, making allegations substantially the same as those in the Nelson complaint. Each of these actions purports to state a claim for damages on behalf of the Company, and is based on statements in the Companys SEC filings and related public disclosures, as well as media reports and Company records, in part regarding the matters described above under - Notices of Inspection of Work Authorization Documents and Related Civil and Criminal Investigations .On January17, 2013, these three shareholder derivative actions were consolidated by the court and will proceed as a single action. The Company intends to defend the cases vigorously, but it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from these cases.
Shareholder Class Actions On August16, 2012, City of Dania Beach Police& Firefighters Retirement System filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of shares of the Companys common stock between February1, 2012 and July19, 2012. On August17, 2012, Sonia Kim filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado that was otherwise identical to the City of Dania Beach Police& Firefighters complaint. The complaints purport to state claims against the Company, each of its co-Chief Executive Officers and its Chief Financial Officer under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations, based on the Companys alleged failure during the claimed class period to disclose material information about the Companys business results and prospects. The complaints assert that those failures and related public statements were false and misleading and that, as a result, the market price of the Companys stock was artificially inflated during the claimed class period. The complaints seek damages on behalf of the purported class in an unspecified amount, interest, an award of reasonable costs and attorneys fees, and injunctive relief. The Company intends to defend these cases vigorously, but it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from the cases.
Miscellaneous The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which the Company incurs greater liabilities than the Company currently anticipates, could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e)promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December31, 2012, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2012 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting .
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst& Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012. This report follows.
58 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.
We have audited Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each ofthe three years in the period ended December31, 2012, and our report dated February8, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
