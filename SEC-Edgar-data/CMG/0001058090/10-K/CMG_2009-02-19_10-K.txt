BUSINESS General Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (Chipotle, the Company, or We) operates 837 restaurants in 33 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Toronto, Canada as of December31, 2008. Our restaurants serve a focused menu of tacos, burritos, salads and burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla), made using fresh ingredients. People outside our company tend to categorize us as a fast casual conceptrestaurants that are a step up from traditional fast food, but not casual, sit-down places. Weve never worried much about what category were in. Instead, we remain focused on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food; on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional; and on building restaurants that are operationally efficient, aesthetically pleasing and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment.
Chipotle began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast-food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way the world thinks about and eats fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine-dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customerfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we caningredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food.
We manage our operations and restaurants based on five regions that all report into a single segment. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, and our total assets as of December31, 2008 and 2007, is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our predecessor corporation, World Foods, Inc., was founded in Colorado in 1993. McDonalds Corporation made an equity investment in us in February1998, becoming our majority shareholder, and simultaneous with McDonalds initial investment in us, World Foods, Inc. merged with Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., a newly-formed Delaware corporation. We completed our initial public offering of class A common stock in January 2006. McDonalds sold a portion of its interest in us in the initial public offering, sold an additional portion of its interest in us in a secondary offering of class A common stock in May 2006, and disposed of its remaining interest in us in an exchange offer to its shareholders that was completed in October 2006. As a result of the completion of the McDonalds exchange offer, we now have two publicly-traded classes of common stock, class A and class B, and McDonalds no longer owns any interest in us.
Our Menu and Food Preparation A Few Things, Thousands of Ways.
We serve only a few things: burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and salads. But because customers can choose from four different meats, two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas, guacamole, cheese and lettuce, theres enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices. We plan to keep a focused menu, but well consider additions that we think make sense. And if you cant find something on the menu thats quite what youre after, let us know. If we can make it from the ingredients we have, well do it.
In preparing our food, we use gas stoves and grills, pots and pans, cutting knives, wire whisks and other kitchen utensils, walk-in refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients, herbs and spices and dry goods 3 Table of Contents such as rice. Ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated in our restaurants, carnitas (seasoned and braised pork), barbacoa (spicy shredded beef) and pinto and vegetarian black beans. We add our rice, which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro, as well as freshly shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, peppers and onions, depending on each customers request. We use various herbs, spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables. We also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole, salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt. In addition to sodas and fruit drinks, most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas. All of our food is prepared from scratch, with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries. With the exception of the sweet corn for one of our salsas, our ingredients are never frozen.
Food Served Fast  So That Customers Can Enjoy It Slowly.
Our employees spend hours preparing our food on-site, but each customer order can be ready in seconds. Customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that have prepared the food. While we think that our customers return because of the great-tasting food, we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a fast-food experience, even when theyre not in a hurry. And while our restaurants often have lines, we try to serve customers as quickly as possible; weve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations. The natural flow of our restaurant layout, including the floor plan and the design of our serving line, are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and, we believe, more efficient. And were focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants, so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic. For instance, our restaurants accept orders over the internet or by fax in order to allow customers in a hurry or with large orders to avoid standing in line to wait for their food. We have installed change machines at the cashier station in virtually all of our restaurants, and have implemented a hand-held point-of-sale terminal in a small number of our restaurants which allows customers to pay with a credit card while waiting in line. We continue to review other equipment and kitchen design modifications to improve the speed of service. By emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews, and by continually making improvements to our restaurants to keep pace at even our highest-volume restaurants, we believe that we can provide the Chipotle experience to more and more customers.
Food With Integrity.
More than anything, serving high quality food is what motivates us. And were always looking to make the food we serve better. As part of our Food With Integrity strategy, we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough, so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our ingredients come from and how the animals are raised. This includes working with experts in the areas of animal ethics to try to support more humane farming practices. Because our menu is so focused, we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient, and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food. All of our pork and all of our chicken in the U.S., for example, is naturally raised. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised in open pastures or deeply bedded penswhich is more stringent than the USDAs new standard for naturally raised marketing claims. We also serve naturally raised beef in about 60% of our restaurants. Were also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce, meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees, while still charging reasonable prices for our food. Today, about 35% of all of the beans we buy are organically grownthat is, they meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards for organic- up from 30% during 2008. All of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH, or recombinant bovine growth hormone, to stimulate milk production. By the end of 2008, 10% of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage significantly during 2009. During 2008 we purchased at least 25% of at least one produce item while in season in each of our markets from small to midsize local farmers.
We do, however, face challenges in pursuing our Food With Integrity strategy, including the length of time it takes to identify and secure relationships with suppliers, and the costs and risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients. Naturally raised meat and sustainably grown vegetables are more costly and the growth process is longer. Herd losses can also be greater when animals are not treated with 4 Table of Contents antibiotics and hormones. Given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices, and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment, many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area. We believe that consumers increasing concern about where and how food is raised, and about the environmental management, animal husbandry and labor practices of food suppliers, will continue to foster demand for these foods over the long-term. We believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce over the long-term will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers. We also understand that well continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing Food With Integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices. If our focus continues to resonate with consumers, it should improve our sourcing flexibility over time, though we expect that these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than commodity-priced equivalents for some time to come.
Quality Assurance and Food Safety.
Chipotle is committed to serving safe, high quality food to our customers. Quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do; from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line. We have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry, and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase. Our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs, including farm, supplier and distributor audits. Our training department develops and implements operating standards for food quality, preparation, cleanliness and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also designed to ensure that we comply with applicable state and local food safety regulations. Although Chipotle was never directly related to the outbreak, during 2008, we responded to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella potentially linked to a variety of fresh produce items by temporarily suspending serving some items and cooking the jalapenos that are used in some of our fresh salsas and guacamole.
Restaurant Management And Operations Culture of High Performers.
We value the individuality of our company, our employees and our customers, which we believe results in a management, operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors. We are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our customers. The foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best teams in our restaurants. We make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food, and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards but that allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success. We provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard, provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others. We provide hands on, shoulder to shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees. Through our culture, diversity and language programs that we provide in all of our markets, we teach English to Spanish-speaking workers, which helps our crew provide better customer service and provides greater career opportunities. This program helps encourage our staff members to develop skills that will enhance their work experience and enrich their personal lives. Our best restaurant managers who run great restaurants and develop strong restaurant teams are promoted to Restaurateur, and can earn bonuses for developing people and building sales. Weve leveraged our outstanding Restaurateurs leadership by giving select Restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants. This provides an opportunity for Restaurateurs to develop in field leadership roles one restaurant at a time.
Importance of Methods and Culture.
Although we have many restaurants, we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques, frozen meats and microwaves used by many traditional fast-food and fast-casual restaurants helps to set us apart. Our crews use classic cooking methods: they marinate and grill meats, hand-chop produce and herbs, make fresh salsa and guacamole, and steam rice in small batches throughout the day. They work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of high-end restaurants than they do a typical fast-food place. Despite our more labor-intensive method of food preparation, our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants.
5 Table of Contents The Front Line is Key.
Our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service. All of our restaurant employees are encouraged to have genuine interactions with customers no matter their job, whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period. We focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer one entree at a time. We provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way. We believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers, crew members and customers alike.
The Basics.
Each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager (a position weve characterized as the most important in the company), an assistant manager, one or two hourly service managers, one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of approximately 17 to 20 full and part-time crew members. We generally have two shifts at our restaurants, which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees. We tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants. We cross-train our people, so that each can work a variety of stations, allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times, while giving our people greater variety and the opportunity to develop a wider array of skills. Consistent with our emphasis on customer service, we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day. And although they may increase our labor costs, we believe that the benefits we provide to our employees, which include language training and a company car program for qualified restaurant managers, help us to attract and keep top performing restaurant managers and crew members.
In addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant, we also have a field support system that includes team leaders, area managers, operations directors and regional directors. For 2009, we are updating the field support structure to ensure it is effective and efficient as we grow and to ensure we have provided a great career path at Chipotlenot only from crew to manager, but also from manager to a field leadership role.
Provisions and Supplies Close Relationships With Suppliers.
Maintaining the high quality levels we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We purchase from various suppliers, carefully selected based on quality and their understanding of our brand, and we seek to develop mutually beneficial long-term relationships with them. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, exchange rates, foreign demand, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices.
We do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers, but have approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants. Distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select based on our quality specifications, and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers.
Distribution Arrangements.
We deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 21 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers. As we continue to expand geographically, we expect to add additional regional distribution centers.
Marketing Our marketing has historically been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands arent built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone, but also through deeply held beliefs that are evident in how the company is run. All of the ways that we project ourselvesbeginning with each customers experience in our restaurants, the look and feel of our restaurants, our advertising and promotional programs, and the design items that carry our name or logoinfluence how people think about us.
6 Table of Contents When we open a new restaurant, we plan a range of activities to introduce Chipotle to the local community and to create interest in the restaurant from the start. Our advertising has generally included print, outdoor, transit and radio ads. In addition, we continue to generate considerable media coverage, with scores of publications writing favorably about our food, restaurant concept and business, and our food and restaurants have been featured in a number of television news programs.
Collectively, these efforts have helped us create considerable word-of-mouth publicity, with our customers learning about us and telling others, allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures.
We also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. To help us improve our marketing direction and message, to deepen our relationships with customers and continue to attract new customers, we hired our first ever Chief Marketing Officer in January 2009. Shortly after filling this new position, we hired a new advertising agency and are taking a fresh look at our marketing strategy and direction with an eye to making our marketing more effective. As part of these efforts, we have developed and introduced in select markets new logos and other branding.
Competition The fast-casual segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented. In addition, fast-casual restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry, including quick-service restaurants and casual dining restaurants. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region, market and even restaurant. All of these restaurants compete based on a number of factors, including taste, quality, speed of service, value, name recognition, restaurant location, customer service and the ambience and condition of each restaurant.
We compete with national and regional fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurants. Our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and in-restaurant cafs of several major grocery store chains. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, and have greater name recognition than we have, and are better established than we are in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located.
We believe were well-positioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends, including the increasing impact of Hispanic culture on food, the growth of the Mexican food segment and increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared. Some of our competitors have formats similar to ours. We believe, however, that Chipotle has become one of the most recognized fast-casual restaurants and is known for its focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food and commitment to Food With Integrity, which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate.
Seasonality Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year.
Our Intellectual Property and Trademarks Chipotle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chipotle Mexican Grill (in stylized font), Unburritable, Food With Integrity, Fresh Is Not Enough, Anymore, The Gourmet Restaurant Where You Eat With Your Hands, the Chili Pepper Logo design, the Foil Burrito design and the Chipotle Medallion design are U.S. registered 7 Table of Contents trademarks of Chipotle. We have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the U.S. In addition to our U.S. registrations, we own the trademarks for Chipotle Mexican Grill in Australia, Brazil and Mexico and for Chipotle in Australia and the European Union, among other countries. We have filed trademark applications for Chipotle and related marks in a number of additional countries, including Canada and the European Union.
We also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress. From time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks, restaurant designs or advertising. Although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.
Information Systems Chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office. This system includes a point-of-sales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant. Additionally, the point-of-sales system is used to authorize, batch and transmit credit card transactions, to record employee time clock information, and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. We believe that our current point-of-sales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion.
Employees As of December31, 2008, we had about 20,400 employees, including 2,090 salaried employees and 18,310 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

RISK FACTORS Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report includes statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. Forward-looking statements include our estimates of the amount of certain expected expenses for 2009, projections of the number of restaurants we expect to open in 2009 and potential changes in our comparable restaurant sales during 2009, statements of our intention to open restaurants in one or more specified particular locations, and statements regarding the potential impact of the current economic downturn on our business. We have used words such as may, will, should, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, believe, think, estimate, seek, expect, predict, could, project, potential and other 8 Table of Contents similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, in this report to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties, risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such risks and other factors include those listed in this Item1A. Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this report.
When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and the documents incorporated by reference. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.
Increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants and is subject to many unpredictable factors.
There were 837 Chipotle restaurants as of December31, 2008. We plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years, and plan to open between 120 and 130 new restaurants in 2009. However, we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors:  our potential inability to locate and secure new restaurant sites in locations that we believe to be attractive;  delay or cancellation of new site development by developers and landlords, which may become more common during 2009 as a result of the difficult economic environment and tight credit markets;  difficulty managing construction and development costs of new restaurants at affordable levels, particularly in competitive markets;  obstacles to hiring and training qualified operating personnel in the local market;  any shortages of construction materials and labor;  difficulty negotiating leases with acceptable terms;  lack of availability of, or inability to obtain, adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards;  failures or delays in securing required governmental approvals (including construction, parking and other permits); and  the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities, such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.
One of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites. Competition for those sites in our target markets can be intense, and development and leasing costs are increasing (particularly for urban locations). Delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results. Moreover, as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline, which may in turn slow our profitability growth.
Our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate, which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods. Similarly, our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant (as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants) may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits.
9 Table of Contents Our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect.
While future sales growth will depend substantially on our plans for new restaurant openings, the level of comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2008, and we do not expect comparable restaurant sales growth to continue at historical levels. We expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2009 to be in the low single digits due to the impact of weaker consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn, potential traffic declines as a result of our recent menu price increases and difficult prior-year comparisons. If the economy remains weak or further weakens, we may lower our expectations for comparable restaurant sales. In addition, our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement a new marketing and branding strategy, our initiative to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer, and expanded use of fax service lines and online ordering, each of which we may not be able to accomplish. As a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales growth or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. If this were to happen, sales and profit growth would be adversely affected and our stock price would be likely to decline.
New restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results.
Historically, many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial ramp-up period typically lasting 24months or more, during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize. This is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area, higher fixed costs relating to increased occupancy costs and other start-up inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants. New restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable. In addition, our average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales likely will not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years and may decline, particularly due to the current economic downturn. Our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending, including weaker consumer spending in difficult economic times;  other impacts of changes in general economic conditions, which can affect local labor costs and prices we pay for the ingredients and other supplies we use;  competition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry, or from our own restaurants as some customers who frequent one of our restaurants may begin to visit one of our new restaurants instead;  consumer understanding and acceptance of the Chipotle experience, which we intend to improve during 2009 with a new branding and marketing strategy that has not been tested;  executing our strategies effectively;  initial sales performance of new restaurants;  road construction, weather and other factors limiting access to new restaurants; and  changes in government regulation.
If we fail to open restaurants as quickly as planned or if new restaurants do not perform as planned, our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, changes in our average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
10 Table of Contents Our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.
Our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain restaurant managers and crew. We also are restructuring our field management structure, in part due to our recent rapid growth. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management, crew and existing infrastructure, and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate. Changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants, and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability. We also place a lot of importance on our culture, which we believe has been an important contributor to our success. As we grow, however, we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. Our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results.
Changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Like all restaurant companies, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, generalized infectious diseases, fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, product recalls and government regulations. The cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and oil increased over the past year. This has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice, and although some prices eased somewhat near the end of 2008, we expect pricing pressures to generally continue in 2009. We have also had a significant increase in the cost of rice, soy oil and sweet corn as a result of the renewal of pricing protocols for those items at the end of the third quarter of 2008. Any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as beef, chicken, cheese, avocados, beans, rice, tomatoes and pork, could adversely affect our operating results. Alternatively, in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to suspend serving menu items, such as guacamole, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients. Any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales.
Instances of food-borne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants and result in negative publicity, thereby resulting in a decline in our sales, or could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat or produce we use to prepare our food.
Instances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. For instance, during 2008 a small number of Chipotle restaurants were associated with separate outbreaks of customer illness, and even in markets in which we were never proven to be the cause of the illnesses our sales were adversely impacted. If our customers become ill from food-borne or localized illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business.
In addition, reports linking a nationwide outbreak of salmonella during the summer of 2008 to a variety of fresh produce items caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu. Similarly, past outbreaks of e. coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains, Asian and European countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu, and incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as hepatitis A or trichinosis) and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past, and could have in the future, an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients. If we 11 Table of Contents react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the Chipotle experience, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. Customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability.
Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.
Labor is a primary component of our operating costs, and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew. Increased labor costs due to factors like competition, increased minimum wage requirements, employee benefits and changes due to our new restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs. Our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees, especially restaurant managers and crew members. Our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings, result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates. Any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly.
Various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws, and the U.S. Congress has recently been considering changes to Federal immigration laws as well. Some of these new laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand.
The impact of the current economic downturn on us may be exacerbated if our suppliers, landlords and other counterparties are not able to continue to do business with us or are forced to alter the terms on which they do business with us.
Some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets, decreased economic activity, fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of the economic downturn. Some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic downturn on their business. If we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services, whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendors bankruptcy or ceasing operations, that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business.
For example, we are aware that the economic environment has forced some food suppliers to seek financing in order to stabilize their businesses, and some suppliers have ceased operations completely. Additional suppliers may encounter difficulties in sustaining their business, and if any of our major suppliers or a large number of other suppliers suspend or cease operations, we may not be able to further our Food With Integrity initiative and may have difficulty keeping our restaurants fully supplied with the high quality ingredients we require. If we were forced to suspend serving one or more of our menu items, that could have a significant adverse impact on our restaurant traffic and public perceptions of us, which would be harmful to our business.
Similarly, our restaurant expansion strategy relies in part on the development of new retail centers and similar projects. Many developers rely on the availability of financing to complete these types of projects, and due to the current volatility in the credit markets financing may not be available on attractive terms or at all.
12 Table of Contents Developers may also delay or cancel projects in light of uncertainty in the commercial leasing market or economic conditions generally. If developers do not proceed with projects in which we plan to locate restaurants, our expansion plans may be hampered, which would adversely impact our growth and future profitability.
Our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas.
Some of our new restaurants are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience. For instance we have announced plans to open a restaurant in London in 2009, which will be our first restaurant outside of North America and our second outside the United States. New markets, particularly outside the United States, may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. As a result, new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets. Consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the Chipotle brand, and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision, passion and culture. Restaurants opened in new markets may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets, and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets. We may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us, either initially or over time, with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels, and may never do so, thereby affecting our overall profitability. Some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the United States due to cultural, regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar, which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results.
We may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higher-quality food.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higher-quality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors, particularly those in the quick-service segment. We may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food, and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach. That could require us to change our pricing, advertising or promotional strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our results or the brand identity that we have tried to create. Consumers may also be more price-sensitive during difficult economic times, and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 that we attribute in part to menu price increases. Many forecasts predict continued economic difficulties throughout 2009, so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future.
Changes in customer tastes and preferences, spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline.
Changes in customer preferences, general economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry. Our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns, including preferences regarding items such as calories, sodium, carbohydrates or fat. These changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods. Our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence, which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels. Negative consumer sentiment in the wake of the economic downturn has been widely reported in 2008 and early 2009. Our sales may decline during this or future economic downturns, which can be caused by various factors such as high gasoline prices, or during periods of uncertainty, such as those that followed the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. Any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family food away from home spending could cause our sales, operating results, profits, business or financial condition to decline. If we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends, we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate.
13 Table of Contents Competition could adversely affect us.
The fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant. Our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments, including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains. Our competitors offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and often have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. Among our main competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market Mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. As we expand further in existing markets, our existing restaurants may face competition from our new restaurants that begin operating in those markets.
Several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates, better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences. Many of our competitors in the fast-casual and quick-service segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lower-cost, value meal menu options, a strategy we do not currently pursue. Our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition.
Moreover, new companies may enter our markets and target our customers. For example, additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and in-store cafs of several major grocery store chains, including those targeted at customers who want higher-quality food, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. These competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have.
In addition, our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets. As we open more restaurants in an existing market, sales may decline in some existing restaurants as customers who frequent one of our established restaurants may begin to visit one of our new restaurants instead.
Any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits.
Our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims.
We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. In conjunction with our separation from McDonalds, we entered into certain new insurance policies with modified coverage. Prior to entering into the new policies, we were covered by fixed cost policies for health insurance and workers compensation. We are now self-insured for our health plans, and have purchased a fully-insured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs.We are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers compensation, general liability and property damage insurance.
For policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
14 Table of Contents We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information.
We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2008, approximately half of our sales were attributable to credit card transactions, and credit card usage could continue to increase. A number of retailers, including us, have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. In August2004, the merchant bank that processed our credit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of credit and debit card data. As a result, we recorded losses and related expenses totaling $4.3 million from 2004 through 2006.
We may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.
Failure to receive frequent deliveries of higher-quality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations.
Our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, inclement weather, a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of our ingredients, which could harm our operations. If any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. We currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients, including beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream and tortillas. Due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our Food With Intergrity suppliers, these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them. In addition, we have relied on the same third party distribution network as McDonalds. We may have to seek new suppliers and service providers with pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants, which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu. If that were to happen, affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter, if our customers change their dining habits as a result. Our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe.
In addition, our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of Food With Integrity. We use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients, and try to make our food as fresh as we can, in light of pricing considerations. As we increase our use of these ingredients, the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained. Our inability to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a cost-effective basis, or at all, could cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with the principle of Food With Integrity. That could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline.
Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.
We are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. Each of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other 15 Table of Contents agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.
We are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications could be material.
Our operations are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters. A lawsuit has been filed against us in California alleging violations of state laws regarding employee record-keeping, meal and rest breaks, payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees.We could suffer losses in this case or similar cases, and any such losses could be significant.In addition, several states in which we operate and the federal government have recently enacted minimum wage increases, and these increases could increase our labor costs.
In recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available. We may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food, which could increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line, decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants. Many environmental laws applicable to us provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We have, however, conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by third-party operations. We believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party. If the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely, then under certain environmental laws, we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination. Any such liability could be material. Further, we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations.
We are implementing a new marketing and branding strategy, and the additional expense associated with this initiative may adversely impact our business.
During 2008 we announced plans to refocus our marketing and branding strategy. In January 2009 we hired Mark Crumpacker as our first Chief Marketing Officer to lead our efforts on this initiative, and also retained a 16 Table of Contents new outside advertising agency. In addition, we have developed and introduced in select markets new logos and other branding. We are still developing many facets of our new marketing and branding strategy, and do not have any assurance that our new strategy will be successful. If new advertising, modified branding and other marketing programs do not drive increased restaurant sales, the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.
Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors, including:  changes in comparable restaurant sales and customer visits, including as a result of declining consumer confidence or the introduction of new menu items;  the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses;  operating costs at newly opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation;  labor availability and wages of restaurant management and crew;  profitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets;  the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities, such as snow storms in many of our primary markets in 2006 and 2007 and freezes in California and Chile during 2008 which impacted avocado crops;  variations in general economic conditions, including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income;  negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at our restaurants;  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;  increases in infrastructure costs;  fluctuations in supply prices; and  tax expenses, impairment charges and other non-operating costs.
Seasonal factors also cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather (because fewer people are eating out) and higher during the spring, summer and fall months (for the opposite reason). Our revenue will also vary as a result of the number of trading days, that is, the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open.
17 Table of Contents As a result of these factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock prices to fall. We believe the market prices of our class A and class B common stock reflect high market expectations for our future operating results, and as a result , if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future, any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant.
The prices of our class A and class B common stock may continue to differ.
Our class B common stock has historically traded at lower prices than our class A common stock. For instance, on February13, 2009, our class A common stock closed at $55.05 per share and our class B common stock closed at $51.17 per share. The trading prices of our class A and class B common stock may continue to differ due to factors outside of our control, including differences in market awareness of the two classes, trading liquidity of the two classes or other factors. In the separation agreement we entered into with McDonalds in connection with our separation from them, we agreed not to take any action to combine the class A and class B common stock or otherwise eliminate the two-class capital structure until at least the fifth anniversary of the separation, unless we obtain McDonalds consent, or McDonalds (at our request) obtains a ruling from the IRS, or we obtain an opinion of counsel satisfactory to McDonalds, that such action will not adversely impact the tax-free nature of our separation from McDonalds. Obtaining such a ruling or opinion involves complex tax laws and fact-specific determinations, and there may be significant obstacles to our obtaining either a ruling or an opinion satisfying the requirements of the separation agreement. Determining whether a ruling or opinion is available will involve significant costs. Moreover, even if we propose to combine the class A and class B common stock or otherwise eliminate the two-class structure we cannot anticipate how the prices of the class A and class B common stock may react to such an action. We may incur a large indemnity obligation to McDonalds if the exchange offer through which we separated from McDonalds is determined to be taxable as a result of our breach of the separation agreement or any action we take to combine the class A and class B common stock or otherwise eliminate the two-class structure. See Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of McDonalds exchange offer could adversely affect us below.
Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from McDonalds could adversely affect us.
We understand that the exchange offer McDonalds completed in October 2006 to dispose of its interest in us should generally be tax-free to McDonalds and its shareholders. Current U.S. tax law generally creates a presumption that a tax-free exchange of the type used by McDonalds would be taxable to McDonalds, but not to its shareholders, if we or our shareholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50% or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the four-year period beginning two years before the date of the exchange, unless it is established that the exchange and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. As a consequence of the foregoing, in the separation agreement we entered into with McDonalds in connection with the separation, we agreed among other things:  to only take action affecting the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our stock on or before the fifth anniversary of the separation if we obtain McDonalds consent, or McDonalds (at our request) obtains a ruling from the IRS, or we obtain an opinion of counsel satisfactory to McDonalds, that such action will not adversely impact the tax-free nature of our separation from McDonalds; and  agreed to indemnify McDonalds for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the exchange failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction, if the taxes and related losses are attributable to (i)direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets (regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions); (ii)negotiations, understandings, agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions; or (iii)our failure to comply with applicable representations and undertakings and the restrictions placed on our actions under the separation agreement.
18 Table of Contents The indemnity described above covers corporate level taxes and related losses suffered by McDonalds in the event of a 50% or greater change in our stock ownership, as well as taxes and related losses suffered by McDonalds if, due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated, the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons. We currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to McDonalds for taxes due in the event of a 50% or greater change in our stock ownership could exceed $450 million. This estimate, which does not take into account related losses, depends upon several factors that are beyond our control. As a consequence, the indemnity to McDonalds could vary substantially from the estimate. Furthermore, the estimate does not address the potential indemnification obligation to McDonalds in the event that, due to any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated, the exchange is determined to be taxable for other reasons. In that event, the total indemnification could extend to tax-related losses suffered by McDonalds shareholders, and therefore would likely be much greater.
Our anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Certain provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our class A or classB common stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult, including provisions relating to the nomination, election and removal of directors, the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders. In addition, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding classA or classB common stock. Any of these provisions, as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with McDonalds described above under Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of McDonalds exchange offer could adversely affect us, may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS A lawsuit has been filed against us in California alleging violations of state laws regarding employee record-keeping, meal and rest breaks, payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees.The case seeks damages, penalties and attorneys fees on behalf of a purported class of our present and former employees. We are currently investigating these claims, and although we have various defenses, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case.
Were involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion together with Item6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. Factors that might cause such differences include those described in Item1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.
Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast-food experience. Over the years, that vision has evolved. Today, our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine-dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customerfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we caningredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food.
2008 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development . As of December31, 2008, we operated 837 restaurants in 33 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Toronto, Canada. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 136 restaurants in 2008. We expect to open between 120 and 130 restaurants in 2009, including one in London.
Sales Growth.
In addition to growing our number of restaurants, we have experienced increases in our average restaurant sales from $1.734 million as of December31, 2007 to $1.763 million as of December31, 2008 driven by comparable restaurant sales increases. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 5.8% in 2008 and 10.8% in 2007. Comparable restaurant sales increases in 2008 were due mainly to menu price increases. Our comparable restaurant sales increases decelerated during 2008, which we believe was due primarily to the weakened economy. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12-month sales for company-operated restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Comparable restaurant sales include company-operated restaurants only and represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operation.
We expect our comparable restaurant sales increases in 2009 to be in the low single digits driven primarily by menu price increases implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially or fully offset by a decrease in customer visits. Due to fluctuations in consumer spending as a result of economic uncertainty, potential traffic declines as a result of our recent menu price increases and variability in prior-year comparisons, we could experience rapid and large changes in our comparable restaurant sales trends during the year.
Food Costs.
The cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and oil increased over 2007 prices. This resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice. In addition, freezes during 2007 in California and Chile put pricing pressure on avocados during 2008. We experienced a significant increase in cheese prices throughout 2008 as a result of the expiration of the pricing protocols under which we operated during 2007. We also experienced significant increases in the cost of rice, soy oil and sweet corn in conjunction with the renewal of those pricing protocols at the end of the third quarter of 2008. In response to the increasing raw ingredient prices, we instituted menu price increases in the fourth quarter of 2008 for most of the country. This increase, combined with some easing of commodity costs will likely result in flat food costs as a percentage of revenue for 2009.
25 Table of Contents Labor.
Although we have not been directly impacted by recent minimum wage increases, we experienced some upward pressure on our restaurant wages in 2008 and expect further pressure into 2009. As a result, we do not expect to see improvements in our labor expense as a percentage of revenue into 2009.
In addition to excelling in providing quality food and customer service, restaurant managers are expected to contribute substantially to the development of their crew. Our restaurant management structure is designed to facilitate the development of crew members into restaurant managers, and we emphasized the importance of hiring and developing great crew at our first all managers conference we held in August.
We continue to focus on ensuring our employee practices are as exceptional as our food. We have sought to ensure that we have an effective and efficient field support system for restaurant managers that supports our efforts to identify people with potential, develops crew into managers and ensures high operating standards of our restaurants. In an effort to achieve this we continue to develop the Restaurateur program, which is designed to encourage the restaurant manager position as a career opportunity for our top performing restaurant managers. We have also been working to leverage our Restaurateurs leadership by giving select Restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring nearby restaurants. This provides the opportunity for Restaurateurs to develop into field leadership roles as well.
Food With Integrity.
In addition to continuing to serve naturally raised pork in all our restaurants, we now serve naturally raised chicken in all of our restaurants in the United States and naturally raised beef in about 60%. However, current economic conditions have led to natural chicken supply shortages. As a result, we temporarily suspended serving naturally raised chicken in certain limited restaurants for a short period of time. We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are fed a pure vegetarian diet, never given antibiotics or hormones, and raised humanely in open pastures or deeply bedded penswhich is more stringent than the USDAs new standard for naturally raised marketing claims. In 2008, 30% of all beans we bought were organically grown and we have increased the percentage to 35% for 2009. Also during 2008, we purchased at least 25% of at least one produce item while in season for each of our markets from small and midsize local farmers. We expect to increase the amount of locally grown produce purchased during 2009. At the end of 2008, 10% of the milk used in our cheese came from cows raised in pastures and we expect to increase that percentage during 2009.
Marketing.
While our marketing approach has often been considered edgy and innovative, we recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. In January 2009 we hired our first chief marketing officer and a new advertising agency, and we are taking a fresh look at our marketing strategy and direction with an eye to making our marketing more effective.
Stock Repurchase.
In September 2008, our Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up to $100 million to repurchase shares of our class B common stock, of which we purchased $30.0 million in 2008. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5-1, authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of class B common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
Cash and Securities.
As of December31, 2008, we had cash and securities of $188.0 million. Given the recent financial turmoil, we have focused on capital preservation and invested our cash and securities solely in U.S. Treasuries, Treasury backed funds and FDIC insured accounts.
2008 Accounting Adjustments.
We completed an analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities and recognized $2.3 million in revenue as a one-time cumulative adjustment for the recognition of unused gift card balances.
We implemented lease management software to perform the calculation of straight-line rent expense and deferred rent. During the implementation, we identified certain adjustments related to our historical straight-line 26 Table of Contents lease calculations, which were not recognized in our 2005 and prior consolidated financial statements. As a result, we recognized an additional $2.6 million in occupancy costs in the current period to correct this misstatement.
See Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional disclosure on the accounting adjustments.

Restaurant Sales For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Restaurant sales $ 1,332.0 $ 1,085.0 $ 819.8 22.8 % 32.4 % Average restaurant sales $ 1.763 $ 1.734 $ 1.611 1.7 % 7.6 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 5.8 % 10.8 % 13.7 % Number of company operated restaurants as of the end of the year 837 704 573 18.9 % 22.9 % Number of company operated restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 133 123 92 The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $182.3 million of the increase in sales in 2008, of which $93.3 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2007, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $167.2 million of the increase in sales, of which $83.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2007.
Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed to $62.6 million and $98.1 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the substantial majority of our comparable restaurant 27 Table of Contents sales growth was driven by menu price increases and in 2007 was due primarily to an increase in the number of transactions and menu price increases in certain markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken.
Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 Food, beverage and packaging $ 431.9 $ 346.4 $ 258.0 24.7 % 34.3 % As a percentage of revenue 32.4 % 31.9 % 31.4 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 due to increased product cost, primarily cheese, chicken and avocados, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets. We saw significantly higher costs for many of our raw ingredients in 2008.
In 2007, food costs increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to increased product costs, primarily avocados, chicken and steak, partially offset by menu price increases in selected markets in conjunction with the introduction of naturally raised beef or chicken, and improvements in food controls.
Labor Costs For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Labor costs $ 351.0 $ 289.4 $ 231.1 21.3 % 25.2 % As a percentage of revenue 26.4 % 26.7 % 28.1 % Labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to the impact of menu price increases partially offset by increased average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with the new restaurant openings.
In 2007, labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased due to more effective management of staffing, improved efficiency as restaurant sales increased faster than the need to add labor and lower insurance claims benefiting us as we became self-insured in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in average wage rates.
Occupancy Costs For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Occupancy costs $ 98.1 $ 75.9 $ 58.8 29.2 % 29.1 % As a percentage of revenue 7.4 % 7.0 % 7.1 % Occupancy costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 primarily due to higher average rents for new locations primarily due to our opening proportionately more restaurants in expensive urban areas in 2008 and a one-time $2.6 million non-cash correction of our historical straight-line rent expense. The increase was partially offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base.
28 Table of Contents In 2007, occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue due to higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base, partially offset by higher rents for new locations.
Other Operating Costs For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Other operating costs $ 164.0 $ 131.5 $ 102.7 24.7 % 28.0 % As a percentage of revenue 12.3 % 12.1 % 12.5 % Other operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to increased utilities, repair and maintenance costs, and credit card processing fees resulting from a higher percentage of our customers using credit cards. The increase was partially offset by lower marketing and promotional spend.
In 2007 other operating costs declined as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the effect of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base and operating efficiencies that were realized as we grew. We also realized a benefit in 2007 related to our promote from within strategy which reduced the dollars we spent on training external hires.
General and Administrative Expenses For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) General and administrative expense $ 89.2 $ 75.0 $ 65.3 18.8 % 14.9 % As a percentage of revenue 6.7 % 6.9 % 7.9 % The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2008 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew, an increase in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the stock-based compensation awards granted in 2008, and the cost of the all manager conference held in the third quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower performance related bonus accruals. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2008 due primarily to menu price increases and lower performance related bonus accruals.
The increase in general and administrative expense in 2007 primarily resulted from hiring more employees as we grew and stock-based compensation awards granted in 2007. The increase was partially offset by the reversal of the credit card contingency reserve in the second quarter of 2007 and the impact of costs incurred for the exchange offer conducted by McDonalds in the third quarter of 2006, a secondary offering of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006 and severance costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2006. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2007 due primarily to the effect of higher restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base, the reversal of the credit card contingency in 2007 and the costs incurred for the secondary and exchange offers and severance negatively impacting 2006.
Depreciation and Amortization For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 52.8 $ 43.6 $ 34.3 21.0 % 27.3 % As a percentage of revenue 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.2 % 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the increase in the number of restaurants from January1, 2006 to December31, 2008.
In 2008, as a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant due to new store openings increasing the average per store depreciable base offset by higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed cost base. In 2007, as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization decreased as a result of higher average restaurant sales on a partially fixed-cost base.
Pre-opening Costs For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Pre-opening costs $ 11.6 $ 9.6 $ 6.8 21.3 % 41.4 % As a percentage of revenue 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.8 % Restaurant openings 136 125 94 Pre-opening costs increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to an increase in rent expense recognized during the construction period and an increase in the number of restaurants opened. Pre-opening costs include non-cash straight-line rent expense of $5.9 million, $4.6 million and $2.7 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Loss on Disposal of Assets For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Loss on disposal of assets $ 9.3 $ 6.2 $ 4.0 51.4 % 54.9 % As a percentage of revenue 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Loss on disposal of assets increased in 2008 as a result of an increase in both the age and number of restaurants and updating older restaurants in certain markets, an increase in write-offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected, and an impairment charge related to a pending closure of a restaurant.
The increase in 2007 in loss on disposal of assets was due to an increase in both the age and number of restaurants, the upgrade of restaurant security systems and an increase in the write-offs associated with investigating potential restaurant sites that we considered but subsequently rejected.
Interest Income For the years ended December31, % decrease 2008over 2007 % decrease 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 3.5 $ 6.1 $ 6.6 (43.3 )% (7.0 )% As a percentage of revenue 0.3 % 0.6 % 0.8 % In 2008, interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on our investments. In addition, late in the third quarter of 2008, we moved our investments into more secure, but lower yielding U.S. Treasury funds. This 30 Table of Contents decrease is partially offset by a higher average cash balance and fewer tax-exempt securities which have lower interest rates but are exempt from federal income taxes. In 2007 interest income decreased primarily due to an increase in investments in tax-exempt securities.
Income Tax Provision For the years ended December31, % increase 2008over 2007 % increase 2007over 2006 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 49.0 $ 43.4 $ 26.8 12.8 % 61.9 % Effective tax rate 38.5 % 38.1 % 39.3 % The 2008 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in earnings on tax-exempt investments partially offset by a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate.
The 2007 effective tax rate decreased primarily due to increased investments in tax-exempt securities and a decrease in our estimated statutory state tax rate.The improvement was partially offset by a $0.5 million tax effect from non-deductible costs associated with the secondary offering and split-off transaction in 2006.
Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December31, 2008. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.
2008 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 305.3 $ 340.8 $ 340.5 $ 345.3 Operating income $ 26.8 $ 38.3 $ 31.1 $ 27.8 Net income $ 17.3 $ 24.5 $ 19.5 $ 16.9 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 49 20 39 Comparable restaurant sales increase 10.2 % 7.1 % 3.1 % 3.5 % 2007 Quarters Ended Mar. 31 June30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 236.1 $ 274.3 $ 286.4 $ 289.0 Operating income $ 18.6 $ 30.7 $ 31.4 $ 27.5 Net income $ 12.4 $ 20.0 $ 20.6 $ 17.6 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 28 32 28 37 Comparable restaurant sales increase 8.3 % 11.6 % 12.4 % 10.6 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results.
Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of 31 Table of Contents the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short-term investment balance of $188.0 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 million of our class B common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs over at least the next 24months.
We havent required significant working capital because customers pay using cash or credit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
In February 2009, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. with an initial principal amount of $25 million and an additional $25 million accordion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set, at our option, at either (i)a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% depending on a lease-adjusted leverage ratio, or (ii)a daily rate equal to (a)the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the banks published prime rate, and one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus (b)a margin ranging from 0.0% to 1.0% depending on a lease-adjusted leverage ratio. The facility requires that we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%, based on the lease-adjusted leverage ratio. Availability of borrowings under the facility requires that we be in compliance with specified covenants including a maximum lease-adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The facility expires in February 2014, but can be terminated or decreased at our option prior to expiration. We intend to use the credit facility, if at all, for letters of credit we issue in the normal course of business and normal short-term working capital needs.
While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. As we expand into more urban areas, our average costs to open new restaurants will increase due to more significant reconstruction work that often needs to be done on those sites. Our total capital expenditures for 2008 were $152.1 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $140 million in 2009, of which $120 million relates to our construction of new restaurants and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2008, we spent on average about $916,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, with end-caps costing about $774,000, in-lines costing about $965,000, free-standing costing about $1.2 million and urban costing about $1.6 million (in each case, reduced for landlord reimbursements). The average development and construction costs per restaurant increased from $880,000 in 2007 due to opening a larger portion of our restaurants in urban locations being partially offset by a decline in the percentage of free-standing restaurant openings and decreasing our average restaurant size. In 2009, we expect average development and construction costs to remain about the same overall as 2008.
32 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December31, 2008 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 1,523,183 $ 88,119 $ 176,929 $ 178,998 $ 1,079,137 Deemed landlord financing 7,029 366 764 788 5,111 Other contractual obligations (1) 22,108 21,578 530   Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,552,320 $ 110,063 $ 178,223 $ 179,786 $ 1,084,248 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships.
Were obligated under non-cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five-year extensions, for end-cap and in-line restaurants, or 15 to 20years with several five-year extensions, for free-standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December31, 2008 and 2007, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, insurance, utility costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage will have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases.
Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases under FASB Statement No.13, Accounting for Leases (FAS13) which requires rent to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
33 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility assumptions were derived primarily from historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to us and our volatility while a public company. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our options and stock appreciation rights, our stock-based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different.
Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies we are either responsible for losses up to certain limits or are self insured but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated resulting in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs.
Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December31, 2008 and 2007. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows.
Sabbatical Liability We offer our employees a sabbatical leave after each ten years of service they complete. We record a liability for our estimate of the accumulated sabbatical expense as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is based on a number of factors including actuarial assumptions and historical trends. Changes in assumptions and trends could result in a materially different liability and expense.
Unredeemed Gift Card Balances The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and the Company determines that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage will be recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used. Gift card breakage is included in total revenue in the consolidated statement of income. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods.
34 Table of Contents Adoption of New Accounting Standards Effective January1, 2008, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.157, Fair Value Measurements, (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. Our interest income decreased during 2008 due to a significant reduction in interest rates. As of December31, 2008, we had $188.2 million deposited in short-term investments and available-for-sale securities bearing a weighted-average interest rate of 0.3% (approximately 0.4% tax equivalent).
Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Substantial portions of the dollar value of goods purchased by us are effectively at spot prices. Though we generally do not have long-term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one month to a year, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices. Increases in ingredient prices have, and could continue to, adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons.
Counterparty Risks Some of our suppliers and other vendors have been adversely impacted by tightening of the credit markets, fluctuations in commodity prices and other consequences of the economic downturn. Some vendors have sought to change the terms on which they do business with us in order to lessen the impact of the economic downturn on their business. If we are forced to find alternative vendors for key services, whether due to demands from the vendor or the vendors bankruptcy or ceasing operations, that could be a distraction to us and adversely impact our business. Changing vendors could also result in our inability to obtain business terms as favorable to us as the terms on which we currently operate.

Initial Public Offering In January2006, the Company completed its offering of 6,061 shares of classA common stock, $0.01 par value, in its initial public offering at a per share price of $22.00 receiving net proceeds of approximately $120.9million (the initial public offering). McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds) sold an additional 3,000 shares, including the underwriters over-allotment shares, in the initial public offering.
McDonalds Disposition From 2000 to October 2006, McDonalds was the controlling shareholder of the Companys voting and economic interest. During 2006, through the initial public offering in January 2006, a secondary offering in May 2006 and a tax-free exchange offer in October 2006 (the Disposition), McDonalds disposed of its interest in the Company and no longer holds any voting or economic interest in the Company.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold. The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and the Company determines that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. The Company completed its analysis of unredeemed electronic gift card liabilities during the quarter ended December31, 2008 and recognized $2,263 ($1,387 net of tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) to revenue as a one-time cumulative adjustment. Gift card breakage will be recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used. Gift card breakage is included in total revenue in the consolidated statement of income.
42 Table of Contents Fees from franchised restaurants included continuing rent and service fees, initial fees and royalties. Continuing fees and royalties were recognized in the period earned. Initial fees were recognized upon opening a restaurant, which is when the Company performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement. The Company purchased its eight franchised restaurants in 2007 and there are no longer any Company franchised restaurants.
The Company reports revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists of tenant improvement receivables, credit card receivables, and miscellaneous receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable based on a specific review of account balances. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recoverability is considered remote.
Inventory Inventory, consisting principally of food, beverages, and supplies, is valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. The Company has no minimum purchase commitments with its vendors. Certain key ingredients (beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, and tortillas) are purchased from a small number of suppliers.
Available-for-Sale Securities Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical securities with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes impairment charges on available-for-sale securities in the consolidated statement of income when management believes the decline in the investment value is other-than-temporary. No impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The available-for-sale securities held at December31, 2008 consist of U.S. Treasuries and mature in February 2009.
Leasehold Improvements, Property and Equipment Leasehold improvements, property and equipment are stated at cost. Internal costs directly associated with the acquisition, development and construction of a restaurant are capitalized and were $6,740, $7,083, and $5,849 for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, which generally includes reasonably assured option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the accounts are relieved of cost and accumulated depreciation and the related gain or loss is reflected in earnings.
The estimated useful lives are: Leasehold improvements and buildings 3-20years Furniture and fixtures 3-10years Equipment 3-7 years 43 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of the business acquired. Goodwill resulted from McDonalds purchases of the Company and the Companys acquisitions of franchises. Goodwill determined to have an indefinite life is not subject to amortization, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provision of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Standard No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS142). In accordance with FAS142, the Company is required to make any necessary impairment adjustments. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill. Based on the Companys analysis, no impairment charges were recognized for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of transferable liquor licenses which are carried at the lower of fair value or cost and a prepaid tax asset related to an intercompany transfer of international intellectual property.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with FASB Standard No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Asset (FAS144), long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are grouped together at the market level. The Company manages its restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, an aggregate impairment charge of $822, $187, and $693, respectively, was recognized in loss on disposition of assets in the consolidated statement of income. The impairment charges resulted from restaurant closures due to city or landlord long-term construction or redevelopment projects, poor site performance and structural damage. Fair value of the restaurants was determined using the expected cash flows method of anticipated cash flows through the estimated date of closure.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, because of their short-term nature, approximates fair value.
Income Taxes The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. When it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, the Company provides a corresponding valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. When it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company measures the amount of tax benefit from the position and records the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized after settlement with a tax authority. The Companys policy is to recognize interest to be paid on an underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and any related statutory penalties in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income.
44 Table of Contents Prior to the completion of the Companys initial public offering, its results of operations were included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of McDonalds. Upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering in January2006, it exited the consolidated tax group for federal and certain state income tax purposes. Upon completion of the Disposition in October 2006, the Company exited the McDonalds consolidated tax group for the remaining state returns. During the period the Company was included in McDonalds consolidated tax returns, the provision for income taxes was calculated on a separate income tax return basis.
Restaurant Pre-Opening Costs Pre-opening costs, including rent, wages, benefits and travel for the training and opening teams, food and other restaurant operating costs, are expensed as incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business.
Insurance Liability The Company maintains various insurance policies for workers compensation, employee health, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies, the Company is responsible for losses up to certain limits and is required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. This liability is based on managements estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. If actual trends differ from the estimates, the financial results could be impacted.
Advertising Costs Advertising is expensed as incurred and aggregated $22,053, $18,629 and $13,918 for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Rent Rent expense for the Companys leases, which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term begins when the Company has the right to control the use of the property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the lease. The difference between the rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheet. Pre-opening rent is included in pre-opening costs in the consolidated income statement. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, $7,088, $5,363, and $3,793 of pre-opening rent was included in pre-opening costs, respectively. Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions of rent expense over the term of the lease.
Additionally, certain of the Companys operating leases contain clauses that provide additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. The Company recognizes contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers contingent rent, provided the achievement of that target is considered probable.
The Company implemented lease management software to perform the calculation of straight-line rent expense and deferred rent. During the implementation, the Company identified certain adjustments related to its historical straight-line lease calculations, which were not recognized in its 2005 and prior period consolidated financial statements. The $2,583 error ($1,583 net of tax, or $0.05 on diluted earnings per share) resulted in the understatement of occupancy costs over multiple years prior to 2006 and deferred rent. The Company has determined the misstatement was not material to its financial condition or results of operations for any one year or to the current year and therefore recorded the adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2008. As the correction related solely to accounting treatment, it did not effect the Companys historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases.
45 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation The Companys international operations generally use its local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, and accounts receivables. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions consistent with its investment policy. The Companys cash and securities balances may exceed federally insured limits. Credit card transactions at our restaurant are processed by one service provider. Concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivables are limited, as the Companys receivables are primarily with its landlords for the reimbursements of tenant improvements.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Standard No.157, Fair Value Measurements, (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The adoption of FAS 157 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
2. Supplemental Financial Information Leasehold improvements, property and equipment were as follows: December31 2008 2007 Land $ 8,215 $ 8,215 Leasehold improvements and buildings 589,283 489,760 Furniture and fixtures 63,100 52,300 Equipment 116,763 95,651 777,361 645,926 Accumulated depreciation (191,462 ) (150,996 ) $ 585,899 $ 494,930 Accrued liabilities were as follows: December31 2008 2007 Gift card liability $ 8,013 $ 9,042 Sales tax payable 6,842 5,645 Other accrued expenses 13,492 12,448 $ 28,347 $ 27,135 46 Table of Contents 3. Income Taxes The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows: Years ended December31 2008 2007 2006 Current tax: U.S. Federal $ 29,291 $ 38,916 $ 24,590 U.S. State 6,512 7,547 4,099 Foreign (53 )   35,750 46,463 28,689 Deferred tax: U.S. Federal 12,513 (3,273 ) (2,263 ) U.S. State 688 (272 ) 406 Foreign (36 )   13,165 (3,545 ) (1,857 ) Valuation allowance 89 521  Total provision for income taxes $ 49,004 $ 43,439 $ 26,832 The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rates as follows: YearsendedDecember31 2008 2007 2006 Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of related federal income tax benefit 3.7 4.2 4.3 Meals and entertainment 0.3 0.3 0.2 Tax-exempt interest income (0.5 ) (1.5 ) (0.2 ) Other (0.1 ) (0.3 )  Valuation allowance 0.1 0.4  Effective income tax rates 38.5 % 38.1 % 39.3 % 47 Table of Contents Deferred income tax liabilities are taxes the Company expects to pay in future periods. Similarly, deferred income tax assets are recorded for expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods. Deferred income taxes arise because of the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities and assets consist of the following: December31, 2008 2007 Long-term deferred income tax liability: Leasehold improvements, property and equipment $ 61,215 $ 38,805 Goodwill and other assets 641 330 Total long-term deferred income tax liability 61,856 39,135 Long-term deferred income tax asset: Deferred rent 21,560 16,645 Gift card liability 70 452 Capitalized transaction costs 503 521 Stock-based compensation and other employee benefits 10,292 5,555 Foreign net operating loss carry-forwards 53  Valuation allowance (485 ) (521 ) Total long-term deferred income tax asset 31,993 22,652 Net long-term deferred income tax liability 29,863 16,483 Current deferred income tax liability: Prepaid assets and other 1,021 596 Total current deferred income tax liability 1,021 596 Current deferred income tax asset: Allowances, reserves and other 3,601 2,683 Stock-based compensation and other employee benefits 85 344 Valuation allowance (108 )  Total current deferred income tax asset 3,578 3,027 Net current deferred income tax asset 2,557 2,431 Total deferred income tax liability $ 27,306 $ 14,052 As of December31, 2008 and 2007 the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. There was no change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the year or in prior periods or due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapses of applicable statute of limitations. The Company is open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable statute of limitations expire. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2006. For the majority of states where the Company has a significant presence, it is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2005. The Companys foreign net operating losses can be carried over to 2028.
At the consummation of the Companys initial public offering, the Company exited McDonalds consolidated tax group for federal and some state tax purposes. At the consummation of the Disposition, the Company exited McDonalds consolidated tax group for the remaining states. Due to the exit from McDonalds consolidated federal tax group, the Company eliminated the deferred tax asset related to the post-acquisition net operating loss carry-forwards of $32,859 and alternative minimum tax credits of $918 through equity. As a result, the Company converted to a net long-term deferred tax liability position. There were no other significant changes to the Companys deferred tax balances as a result of the tax deconsolidation.
48 Table of Contents 4. Shareholders Equity The Companys restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of an aggregate 230,000 shares of common stock consisting of 30,000 shares of classB common stock with a $0.01 par value and 200,000 shares of classA common stock with a $0.01 par value. Prior to the Disposition, each share of classB common stock was convertible at the option of the shareholder into one share of classA common stock, and each share of class B common stock generally also converted into one share of class A common stock if a transfer of ownership occurred. Shares of class B common stock are no longer convertible beginning October12, 2006. Shares of classB common stock participate equally in dividends with shares of classA common stock. Shares of classB and class A common stock generally vote as a single class of common stock. Shares of classB common stock have ten votes per share whereas classA common stock shares have one vote per share, except that for purposes of approving a merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all property or dissolution, each share of both classA and classB will have only one vote.
During 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $100 million to repurchase shares of class B common stock. The shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. The Company repurchased 692 shares of its class B common stock for a total cost of $30,227 during 2008. The 692 shares are being held in treasury stock until such time as they are reissued or retired, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
5. Stock Based Compensation Effective with the Companys initial public offering the Company adopted the Chipotle Mexican Grill,Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan. An amended and restated plan (the Plan) was approved at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders on May21, 2008. Under the Plan, 4,450 shares of classA common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees, of which 2,849 represent shares that were authorized for issuance, but not issued under the Plan at December31, 2008. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which has the authority to select the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to determine the type of awards and when the awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each award, the vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of the awards. The exercise price for stock awards granted under the Plan cannot be less than fair market value at the date of grant.
Compensation expense on options and stock only stock appreciation rights (SAR) is generally recognized equally over the three year vesting period. Compensation expense related to employees eligible to retire and retain full rights to the awards is recognized over six months which coincides with the notice period. Compensation expense on performance shares is generally recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion. Stock-based compensation, including options, SARs and stock awards, was $11,976 ($7,344 net of tax) in 2008, $8,136 ($4,955 net of tax) in 2007 and $5,293 ($3,218 net of tax) in 2006. During the year ended December31, 2006, stock-based compensation expense included $1,115 from the acceleration of vesting on 49 options upon the termination of two employees. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, $602, $335 and $100 of stock-based compensation was recognized as capitalized development and is included in leasehold improvements, property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet.
49 Table of Contents The tables below summarize the option and SAR activity under the Plan (in thousands, except years and per share data): 2008 2007 2006 Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Outstanding, beginning of year 965 $ 33.87 940 $ 21.26 374 $ 18.67 Granted 332 $ 102.67 275 $ 63.89 774 $ 22.00 Exercised (22 ) $ 21.21 (207 ) $ 18.68 (150 ) $ 18.33 Forfeited (61 ) $ 42.96 (43 ) $ 23.15 (58 ) $ 22.01 Outstanding, end of year 1,214 $ 52.49 965 $ 33.87 940 $ 21.26 Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Years of Contractual Life Aggregate Instrinsic Value Outstanding as of December31, 2008 1,214 $ 52.49 4.8 $ 25,110 Vested and expected to vest as of December31, 2008 (1) 1,208 $ 52.30 4.8 $ 25,110 Exercisable as of December31, 2008 45 $ 34.50 3.0 $ 1,408 (1) The expected to vest options are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total outstanding options.
Generally, the options and SARs vest over three years and expire after seven years. The total intrinsic value of options and SARs exercised during the years ended December31 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $893, $17,749 and $4,947. Unearned compensation as of December31, 2008 was $7,364 for options and SAR awards. The remaining vesting period as of December31, 2008 for unvested options and SAR awards was generally between 0.1 and 2.2 years.
A summary of non-vested stock award activity under the Plan is as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 2008 2007 Shares GrantDate Fair Value Shares GrantDate Fair Value Outstanding, beginning of year 123 $ 64.75  Granted 109 $ 87.36 123 $ 64.75 Forfeited (3 ) $ 99.19  Outstanding, end of year 229 $ 75.06 123 $ 64.75 At December31, 2008, 226 of the outstanding non-vested stock awards were subject to both service and performance conditions based on reaching specified cumulative operating income levels during certain timeframes. During 2008, the Company replaced 120 previously issued non-vested time-based stock awards with an equal number of performance-contingent restricted stock. The modification did not result in the recognition of any additional stock based-compensation. Unearned compensation as of December31, 2008 was $9,073 for unvested stock awards. The remaining vesting period as of December31, 2008 for unvested stock awards was generally between 0.3 and 2.6 years.
In 2005, the Company granted 153 shares of non-vested class B common stock with a grant date fair value of $19.50 per share (a related party contemporaneous valuation) which vested evenly over three years. The fair value of shares vested during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $5,124, $3,053 and $2,786.
50 Table of Contents During 2008, certain grants were made subject to shareholder approval. The value of grants subject to shareholder approval, were determined on the date of approval. The following table reflects the average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value stock options and SARs awards granted: 2008 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate 3.1 % 4.7 % 4.4 % Expected life (years) 4.8 5.0 5.0 Expected dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Volatility 35 % 35 % 40.0 % Weighted Average Black-Scholes fair value per share at date of grant $ 29.01 $ 24.80 $ 9.21 The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury Rates for instruments with similar terms. The expected life was derived utilizing the short-cut method allowed for a vanilla option grant under Staff Accounting Bulletin No.107, in which the expected life is assumed to be the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the option. The Company has not paid dividends to date and does not plan to pay dividends in the near future. The volatility assumptions were derived from the Companys actual and implied volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets and are adjusted to reflect anticipated behavior specific to the Company.
6. Employee Benefit Plans In October 2006, effective upon consummation of the Disposition, the Company adopted the Chipotle Mexican Grill 401(k) plan (the 401(k) plan). Prior to October 2006, eligible Chipotle employees were participants of a 401(k) plan sponsored by McDonalds. The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed. Employees become eligible to receive matching contributions after one year of service with the Company. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Company matching contributions totaled approximately $1,402, $1,234 and $1,070, respectively.
As a result of the Disposition, the Company adopted the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Supplemental Deferred Investment Plan (the Deferred Plan) which covers eligible employees of the Company. The Deferred Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions that cannot be made under the 401(k) plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. Participants earnings on contributions made to the Deferred Plan fluctuate with the actual earnings and losses of a variety of available investment choices selected by the participant. Total liabilities under the Deferred Plan as of December31, 2008 and 2007 were $1,790 and $800, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed once the 401(k) contribution limits are reached. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company made deferred compensation matches of $252, $137 and $25 respectively, to the Deferred Plan. Prior to October 2006, eligible Chipotle employees were participants of a deferred compensation plan sponsored by McDonalds.
7. Related-Party Transactions Prior to the Disposition, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of McDonalds. Transactions through the date of separation are considered related-party transactions and are discussed below.
The consolidated statement of income reflects charges from McDonalds of $8,667 for the year ended December31, 2006. These charges primarily related to reimbursements of payroll and related expenses for certain McDonalds employees that performed services for the Company, insurance coverage, software maintenance agreements and non-income based taxes. The charges were specifically identifiable to the Company. The Company cannot estimate with any reasonable certainty what these charges would have been on a stand-alone basis. However, the Company feels that these charges are indicative of what it could have incurred on a stand-alone basis.
51 Table of Contents The Company leased office and restaurant space from McDonalds and its affiliates. Rent expense was $276 for such leases for the year ended December31, 2006.
8. Leases The Company generally operates its restaurants in leased premises. Lease terms for traditional shopping center or building leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 20-25years. Ground leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 30-50years. The option terms in each of these leases are typically in five-year increments. Typically, the lease includes rent escalation terms every five years including fixed rent escalations, escalations based on inflation indexes, and fair market value adjustments. Certain leases contain contingent rental provisions based upon the sales of the underlying restaurants. The leases generally provide for the payment of common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance and various other use and occupancy costs by the Company. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices.
Future minimum lease payments required under existing operating leases as of December31, 2008 are as follows: 2009 $ 88,119 2010 88,527 2011 88,402 2012 88,933 2013 90,065 Thereafter 1,079,137 Total minimum lease payments $ 1,523,183 Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $3,516 due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.
Rental expense consists of the following: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Minimum rentals $ 90,547 $ 70,375 $ 50,880 Contingent rentals $ 1,602 $ 1,162 $ 955 Sublease rental income $ (1,201 ) $ (1,499 ) $ (3,365 ) The Company has six sales and leaseback transactions. These transactions do not qualify for sales leaseback accounting because of the Companys deemed continuing involvement with the buyer-lessor due to fixed price renewal options, which results in the transaction being recorded under the financing method. Under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds from the transactions are recorded as a financing liability. A portion of lease payments are applied as payments of deemed principal and imputed interest. The deemed landlord financing liability was $3,960 as of December31, 2008. The future minimum lease payments for each of the next five years and thereafter for deemed landlord financing obligations are as follows: 2009 $ 366 2010 373 2011 391 2012 394 2013 394 Thereafter 5,111 Total minimum lease payments 7,029 Less: Interest implicit in lease (3,069 ) Total deemed landlord financing $ 3,960 52 Table of Contents 9. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share, diluted EPS, is calculated using income available to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to stock options, SARs and non-vested stock. Diluted EPS considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. Options to purchase 586 shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of 2008 diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive. In addition, 226 stock awards subject to performance conditions were excluded from the 2008 calculation of diluted EPS.
The following table sets forth the computations of basic and dilutive earnings per share: Year ended December31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 78,202 $ 70,563 $ 41,423 Shares: Weighted average number of common shares outstanding 32,766 32,672 32,051 Dilutive stock options 341 397 319 Dilutive non-vested stock 39 77 95 Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding 33,146 33,146 32,465 Basic earnings per share $ 2.39 $ 2.16 $ 1.29 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.36 $ 2.13 $ 1.28 10. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The Company enters into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements and orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction.
Letters of Credit As of December31, 2008, two letters of credit were issued for an aggregate amount of $6,312 which expire in November 2009.
Litigation A lawsuit has been filed against the Company in California alleging violations of state laws regarding employee record-keeping, meal and rest breaks, payment of overtime and related practices with respect to its employees.The case seeks damages, penalties and attorneys fees on behalf of a purported class of the Companys present and former employees.The Company is currently investigating these claims, and although it has various defenses it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case.
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other proceedings, lawsuits and claims. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, the Company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December31, 2008. These matters could affect the operating results of any one quarter when resolved in future periods. Management does not believe that any monetary liability or financial 53 Table of Contents impact to the Company as a result of these proceedings or claims will be material to the Companys annual consolidated financial statements. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims resulting in greater liabilities than the Company currently anticipates, could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.

Subsequent Events In February 2009, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. with an initial principal amount of $25 million and an additional $25 million accordion feature. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate set, at the Companys option, at either (i)a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 2.0% depending on a lease-adjusted leverage ratio, or (ii)a daily rate equal to (a)the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, the banks published prime rate, and one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus (b)a margin ranging from 0.0% to 1.0% depending on a lease-adjusted leverage ratio. The facility includes a commitment fee on the unused balance ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%, based on the lease-adjusted leverage ratio. Availability of borrowings under the facility requires that the Company be in compliance with specified covenants including a maximum lease-adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The facility expires in February 2014, but can be terminated or decreased at the Companys option prior to expiration. The Company intends to use the credit facility, if at all, for letters of credit issued in the normal course of business and normal short-term working capital needs.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e)promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December31, 2008, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes during the year ended December31, 2008 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting .
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2008, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst& Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.
55 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.
We have audited Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria .
