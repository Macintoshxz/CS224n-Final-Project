BUSINESS General Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Chipotle, the Company, or We) operate restaurants throughout the United States, as well as two restaurants in Toronto, Canada and two in London, England. As of December31, 2011, we operated 1,230 restaurants, which includes one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen. Chipotle restaurants serve a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads, made using fresh ingredients. We focus on trying to find the highest quality ingredients we can to make great tasting food; on recruiting and retaining top performing people to ensure that the restaurant experience we provide is exceptional; on building restaurants that are operationally efficient and aesthetically pleasing; and on doing all of this with increasing awareness and respect for the environment. We have grown substantially over the past five years, and expect to open between 155 and 165 additional restaurants in 2012.
Our vision is to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine-dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design and have friendly people to take care of each customerfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Our approach is also guided by our belief in an idea we call Food With Integrity. Our objective is to find the highest quality ingredients we caningredients that are grown or raised with respect for the environment, animals and people who grow or raise the food.
We manage our operations and restaurants based on six regions that aggregate into one reportable segment. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, and our total assets as of December31, 2011 and 2010, is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Substantially all of our revenues are generated and assets are located in the U.S.
Our Menu and Food Preparation Food With Integrity.
Serving high quality food while still charging reasonable prices is critical to our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. As part of our Food With Integrity philosophy, we believe that using fresh ingredients is not enough, so we spend time on farms and in the field to understand where our food comes from and how it is raised. Because our menu is so focused, we can concentrate on where we obtain each ingredient, and this has become a cornerstone of our continuous effort to improve our food. As of December31, 2011, we were serving exclusively naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants in the U.S. Continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our goals, but as discussed below, we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011, a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints.We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsiblythat is, in accordance with our animal welfare standards.
Were also investigating the use of more sustainably grown produce, meaning produce grown by suppliers who we believe respect the environment and their employees. A portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown, or sourced locally while in season (by which we mean grown within 350 miles of the restaurant). A portion of our beans is organically grown and a portion is sustainably grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions, reduce erosion, and help preserve the environment in which the beans are grown. Our Food With Integrity commitment extends to the dairy products we serve as well. All of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone). Also, milk used to make much of our cheese and a portion of our sour cream is sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing pasture access for their cows.
3 Table of Contents We do, however, face challenges associated with pursuing Food With Integrity. For example, current economic conditions have led to naturally raised chicken and steak supply shortages. It can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria, and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients. Growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens, cattle and pigs that are not fed sub-therapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones. Organic and sustainable crops can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower for organically or sustainably grown produce. Given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices, and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment, many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area. However, we believe that in addition to seeking great tasting and nutritious food, consumers are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it is raised. And we believe that as consumers become more educated about better animal welfare and farming practices as well as social accountability, they will foster greater demand for sustainably grown foods in the long-term. We believe that increased demand for naturally raised meat and produce over the long-term will continue to attract the interest and capital investment of larger farms and suppliers. We also understand that well continue to be at the forefront of this trend and must balance our interest in advancing Food With Integrity with our desire to provide great food at reasonable prices. If we are able to continue growing while focusing on Food With Integrity our sourcing flexibility should improve over time, though we expect that most of these ingredients and other raw materials will remain more expensive than conventionally raised, commodity-priced equivalents.
A Few Things, Thousands of Ways.
Chipotle restaurants serve only a few things: burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and salads. But because customers can choose from four different meats, two types of beans and a variety of extras such as salsas, guacamole, cheese and lettuce, theres enough variety to extend our menu to provide countless choices. We plan to keep a simple menu, but well consider additions that we think make sense. And if you cant find something on the menu thats quite what youre after, let us know. If we can make it from the ingredients we have, well do it.
In preparing our food, we use stoves and grills, pots and pans, cutting knives, wire whisks and other kitchen utensils, walk-in refrigerators stocked with a variety of fresh ingredients, herbs and spices and dry goods such as rice. Ingredients we use include chicken and steak that is marinated and grilled in our restaurants, carnitas (seasoned and braised pork), barbacoa (spicy shredded beef) and pinto and vegetarian black beans. We add our rice, which is tossed with lime juice and freshly chopped cilantro, as well as freshly shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, peppers and onions, depending on each customers request. We use various herbs, spices and seasonings to prepare our meats and vegetables. We also provide a variety of extras such as guacamole, salsas and tortilla chips seasoned with fresh lime and kosher salt. In addition to sodas, fruit drinks and organic milk, most of our restaurants also offer a selection of beer and margaritas. Our food is prepared from scratch, with the majority prepared in our restaurants while some is prepared with the same fresh ingredients in commissaries.
Food Served Fast  So That Customers Can Enjoy It Slowly.
Our employees spend hours preparing our food on-site, but each customer order can be ready in seconds. Customers select exactly what they want and how they want it by speaking directly to the employees that prepared the food and are assembling the order. While we think that our customers return because of the great-tasting food, we also think that they like getting food served fast without having a fast-food experience, even when theyre not in a hurry. And while our restaurants often have lines, we try to serve customers as quickly as possible. Weve even been able to serve more than 300 customers an hour at some locations. The natural flow of our restaurant layout, including the floor plan and the design of our serving line, are designed to make the food ordering process intuitive and, we believe, more efficient. And were focused on further improving the speed of service in all of our restaurants, so that we can accommodate more customers and larger orders without disrupting restaurant traffic. For instance, our restaurants accept orders by fax, online or through an iPhone ordering application in order to provide a more convenient experience by allowing customers to avoid standing in line. By emphasizing speed of service without compromising the genuine interactions between our customers and our crews, and by continually making improvements to our restaurants, we believe that we can provide a high quality experience to more and more customers.
4 Table of Contents Quality Assurance and Food Safety.
We are committed to serving safe, high quality food to our customers. Quality and food safety is integrated throughout our supply chain and everything we do; from the farms that supply our food all the way through to our front line. We have established close relationships with some of the top suppliers in the industry, and we actively maintain a limited list of approved suppliers from whom our distributors must purchase. Our quality assurance department establishes and monitors our quality and food safety programs for our supply chain. Our training and risk management departments develop and implement operating standards for food quality, preparation, cleanliness and safety in the restaurants. Our food safety programs are also designed to assure that we comply with applicable federal, state and local food safety regulations.
Restaurant Management and Operations Culture of Top Performers.
In addition to the focus on our food, we have a similarly focused people culture with an emphasis on identifying, hiring and empowering top performing employees. We are committed to creating a performance based culture that leads to the best restaurant experience possible for our employees and our customers. The foundation of that culture starts with hiring the best people in our restaurants. We make an effort to hire employees who share a passion for food and who will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards, yet allows each of their unique personalities and strengths to contribute to our success. We believe we provide attractive career opportunities to crew and managers who are committed to work hard, provide great customer service and have the ability to lead and empower others. We provide hands on, shoulder-to-shoulder training to develop the full potential of our restaurant employees. We are committed to developing our people and promoting from within, with almost 98% of salaried management and more than 98% of hourly management coming from internal promotions. Our best restaurant managers, who run great restaurants and develop strong, empowered restaurant teams, are promoted to Restaurateur and in that role can earn bonuses for developing people. Weve leveraged our outstanding Restaurateurs leadership by giving select Restaurateurs responsibility for mentoring one or more nearby restaurants. This provides an opportunity for Restaurateurs to develop field leadership roles one restaurant at a time. Restaurateurs who have shown they can successfully run four restaurants by developing teams of all top performers (including at least one Restaurateur), thereby creating a culture of high standards, constant improvement and empowerment in each of their restaurants, can be promoted to Apprentice Team Leaders.
Importance of Methods and Culture.
Although we have many restaurants, we believe that our departure from the automated cooking techniques and microwaves used by many traditional fast-food and fast-casual restaurants helps to set us apart. Our crews use classic cooking methods: they marinate and grill meats, hand-cut produce and herbs, make fresh salsa and guacamole, and cook rice in small batches throughout the day. They work in kitchens that more closely resemble those of high-end restaurants than they do a typical fast-food place. Despite our more labor-intensive method of food preparation, our focused menu creates efficiencies which allow us to serve high quality food made from ingredients typically found in fine dining restaurants.
The Front Line is Key. Our restaurant and kitchen designs intentionally place crew members up front with customers to reinforce our focus on service, and our open kitchen design allows customers to see that we prepare our food fresh, each and every day. All of our restaurant employees are encouraged to interact with customers no matter their job, whether preparing food or serving customers during our busiest period. We focus on attracting and retaining people who can deliver that experience for each customer one burrito at a time. We provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way. We believe our focus on creating a positive and interactive experience helps build loyalty and enthusiasm for our brand among restaurant managers, crew members and customers alike.
The Basics.
Each restaurant typically has a restaurant manager (a position weve characterized as the most important in the company), an apprentice manager (in about three-quarters of our restaurants), one or two hourly service managers, one or two hourly kitchen managers and an average of 20 full and part-time crew members. We generally have two shifts at our restaurants, which simplifies scheduling and provides stability for our employees. We tend to have more employees in our busier restaurants. We cross-train our people so that each can work a variety of stations, allowing us to work efficiently during our busiest times, while giving our people the 5 Table of Contents opportunity to develop a wider array of skills. Consistent with our emphasis on customer service, we encourage our restaurant managers and crew members to welcome and interact with customers throughout the day. In addition to the employees serving our customers at each restaurant, we also have a field support system that includes apprentice team leaders, team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors.
Supply Chain Close Relationships with Suppliers.
Maintaining the high levels of quality we expect in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire high-quality, fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Our distribution centers purchase from various suppliers we carefully select based on quality and their understanding of our mission, and we seek to develop mutually beneficial long-term relationships with suppliers. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility and supply shortages, and we follow industry news, trade issues, weather, exchange rates, foreign demand, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Certain key ingredients (beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, and tortillas) are purchased from a small number of suppliers.
We generally do not purchase raw materials directly from farmers or other suppliers, but have selected and approved all of the suppliers from whom ingredients are purchased for our restaurants. Distribution centers purchase ingredients and other supplies from suppliers we select and approve based on our quality specifications, and purchase within the pricing guidelines and protocols we have established with the suppliers.
Distribution Arrangements.
We deliver ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants from 22 independently owned and operated regional distribution centers. As we continue to expand geographically, we expect to add additional regional distribution centers.
Marketing Our marketing has always been based on the belief that the best and most recognizable brands arent built through advertising or promotional campaigns alone, but rather through all of the ways people experience the brand. So we pay close attention to all of these details, looking to keep our communications closely aligned with the ways our customers experience Chipotle. Our advertising and promotional programs, in-store communications, and other design elements (such as menus and signs) all say something about who we are, and we believe its important that we present our brand consistently in our communications and the experience our customers enjoy. That has always been a hallmark of our marketing, and we are constantly looking to do these things better.
When we open restaurants in new markets, we plan a range of activities to introduce Chipotle to the local community and to create interest in the restaurant from the start. In existing markets, our restaurants generally open strong, with volumes at or near market averages, even with little promotion surrounding the opening. Our advertising has generally included print, outdoor, transit and radio ads, but we are also incorporating online advertising into the mix, and adding strategic promotions that demonstrate how Chipotle is different than other restaurant concepts, or that connect us to like-minded individuals or organizations. In addition, we continue to generate considerable media coverage, with scores of publications writing favorably about our food, restaurant concept and business, and our food, restaurants and company have been featured in a number of television programs.
We also recognize the need for our marketing to evolve, much as we have evolved our food culture and our unique people culture. To this end, we have been testing more owned media, including new video and music programs, and a more visible event strategy that includes the launch of our first festival of food, music and ideas, Cultivate Chicago, and participation in relevant events in markets around the country. Many of these newer programs allow us to tell our story with more nuance than is afforded by traditional advertising, and help forge stronger emotional connections with our customers. We are also increasing our use of digital, mobile, and social 6 Table of Contents media to our overall marketing mix, giving customers greater opportunity to access Chipotle in ways that are convenient for them, and broadening our ability to engage with our customers individually. Through our first ever customer loyalty program, the Farm Team, we are inviting our most loyal and passionate customers to join a program that educates them about many of the things that make Chipotle special, and rewarding them for expanding and sharing their knowledge of our company.
Collectively, these efforts and our excellent restaurant teams have helped us create considerable word-of-mouth publicity, with our customers learning about us and telling others, allowing us to build awareness with relatively low advertising expenditures, even in a competitive category, and to differentiate Chipotle as a company that is committed to doing the right things in every facet of our business.
Competition We compete with national and regional fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurants. Our competition also includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and the deli sections and in-store cafs of several major grocery store chains. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region, market and even restaurant. Competitors to our restaurants compete based on a number of factors, including taste, quality, speed of service, price and value, name recognition, location, customer service and the ambience and condition of the competitor. Unlike us, a number of our competitors grow through franchising.
We believe were well-positioned to continue to grow our market position in existing and new markets given current consumer trends, including increasing awareness and concern among consumers about what they eat and how it is prepared and the increasing prevalence of the fast-casual segment. Some of our competitors have formats that might resemble ours. We believe, however, that Chipotle has become one of the most recognized fast-casual restaurants and that we are known for our focus on preparing food using a variety of fresh ingredients in an open restaurant kitchen to create delicious food, as well as our commitment to Food With Integrity, which we think represents a significant competitive advantage in the segment in which we operate.
Restaurant Site Selection We believe that site selection is critical to our success and thus we devote substantial time and effort to evaluating each potential location. Our site selection process includes the use of external real estate brokers with expertise in specific markets, taking direction from our internal team of real estate managers. Locations proposed by real estate managers are reviewed on site by a team of operations and development management as part of a formal site ride, as well as in a written real estate package. We study the surrounding trade area, demographic and business information within that area, and available information on competitors. Based on this analysis, including utilization of predictive modeling using proprietary formulas, we determine projected sales and targeted return on investment. We have been successful in a number of different types of locations, such as in-line or end-cap locations in strip or power centers, regional malls, downtown business districts, free-standing buildings, and even an airport location.
ShopHouse Test Concept We believe that the fundamental principles on which our restaurants are basedfinding the very best sustainably raised ingredients, prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer, and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experiencecan be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at Chipotle. In order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food, we opened ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen during 2011. ShopHouse serves a menu that, like at Chipotle, is focused; main dishes consist of rice or noodle bowls or banh mi sandwiches, made with steak, chicken, meatballs made with pork and chicken, or tofu.
Notwithstanding our opening of ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and our plans to open one additional ShopHouse restaurant during 2012, our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the Chipotle brand.
7 Table of Contents Seasonality Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and profits are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year.
Our Intellectual Property and Trademarks Chipotle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Unburritable, Food With Integrity, Fresh Is Not Enough, Anymore, The Gourmet Restaurant Where You Eat With Your Hands, ShopHouse and a number of related designs and logos are U.S. registered trademarks of Chipotle. We have filed trademark applications for a number of other marks in the U.S. In addition to our U.S. registrations, we have registered trademarks for Chipotle and a number of other marks in Canada, the European Union and various other countries, and have filed trademark applications for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chipotle and a number of other marks in various countries as well.
We also believe that the design of our restaurants is our proprietary trade dress. From time to time we have taken action against other restaurants that we believe are misappropriating our trademarks, restaurant designs or advertising. Although our policy is to protect and defend vigorously our rights to our intellectual property, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.
Information Systems Chipotle uses an integrated information system to manage the flow of information within each restaurant and between the restaurants and the corporate office. This system includes a point-of-sales local area network that helps facilitate the operations of the restaurant by recording sales transactions and printing orders in the appropriate locations within the restaurant. Additionally, the point-of-sales system is used to authorize, batch and transmit credit card transactions, to record employee time clock information, and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system is transmitted to the corporate office on a daily basis, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. We believe that our current point-of-sales systems will be an adequate platform to support our continued expansion. See Risk Factors We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information below for a discussion of certain risks associated with our point-of-sales systems.
Employees As of December31, 2011, we had about 30,940 employees, including about 2,570 salaried employees and about 28,370 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

ITEM1A.
RISK FACTORS Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report includes statements of our expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. These statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, relate to the discussion of our business strategies and our expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources and to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. Forward-looking statements include our projections of the number of restaurants we expect to open in 2012, our estimates of the amount of certain expected expenses and potential changes in our comparable restaurant sales during 2012, statements of our intention to open restaurants in one or more specified locations, statements regarding the potential impact of ongoing economic uncertainty on our business, and our projections of our effective tax rate for 2012. We have used words such as may, will, should, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, believe, think, estimate, seek, expect, predict, could, project, potential and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, in this report to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties, risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such risks and other factors include those listed in this Item1A. Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this report.
When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and future reports we file with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.
Increasing our sales and profitability depends substantially on our ability to open new restaurants, which is subject to many unpredictable factors.
We operated 1,230 restaurants as of December31, 2011. We plan to increase the number of our restaurants significantly in the next three years, and plan to open between 155 and 165 new restaurants in 2012. However, we have in the past experienced delays in opening some restaurants and that could happen again as a result of any of the following factors:  our potential inability to locate and secure new restaurant sites in locations that we believe to be attractive;  obstacles to hiring and training qualified operating personnel in the local market;  delay or cancellation of new site development by developers and landlords, which may become increasingly common during periods of economic uncertainty or tight credit;  difficulty managing construction and development costs of new restaurants at affordable levels, particularly in competitive markets;  difficulty negotiating leases with acceptable terms;  any shortages of construction materials and labor;  lack of availability of, or inability to obtain, adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards; 9 Table of Contents  failures or delays in securing required governmental approvals (including construction, parking and other permits); and  the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.
One of our biggest challenges is staffing new restaurants. We seek to hire only top-performing employees and to promote restaurant managers from our crew, which may make it more difficult for us to staff all the restaurants we intend to open. Constraints on our hiring new employees are described further below under Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants .
Another significant challenge is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites. Competition for those sites in our target markets can be intense, and development and leasing costs are increasing, particularly for urban locations. These factors may be exacerbated by any ongoing tightness in credit markets, as developers may continue to delay or be unable to finance new projects. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants due to any of the reasons set forth above could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our expected results. Moreover, as we open and operate more restaurants our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will decline, which may in turn slow our sales and profitability growth.
Our progress in opening new restaurants from quarter to quarter may also occur at an uneven rate, which may result in quarterly sales and profit growth falling short of market expectations in some periods. Similarly, our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant (as well as the impact of our new restaurants on the sales of our existing restaurants) may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits. We expect that our new restaurant openings in 2012 will be weighted more heavily to the second half of the year, though more evenly dispersed through the year than in 2011. The weighting of openings to the second half of 2012 may adversely affect our revenue growth during the first half of the year and our profitability in the second half.
Our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales increases are less than we expect, and we may not successfully increase comparable restaurant sales.
While future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full month of operations) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the higher profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. We expect comparable restaurant sales increases in 2012 to be in the mid single digits due to difficult comparisons with 2011 and ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.
Our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending, including weaker consumer spending in difficult economic times such as those that have persisted throughout much of the past three years;  consumer understanding and acceptance of the Chipotle experience and perceptions of the Chipotle brand;  our ability to increase menu prices without adversely impacting transaction counts to such a degree that the impact from lower transactions equals or exceeds the benefit of the menu price increase;  competition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry, or from our own restaurants as some customers who frequent one of our restaurants may begin to visit one of our new restaurants instead; 10 Table of Contents  executing our strategies effectively, including our development strategy, our marketing and branding strategies, our initiatives to increase the speed at which our crew serves each customer, and expanded use of fax service lines and online ordering, each of which we may not be able to accomplish;  initial sales performance of new restaurants, which is subject to the risks described below under Our new restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants ;  weather, road construction and other factors limiting access to new restaurants; and  changes in government regulation.
A number of these factors are beyond our control. As a result of these factors it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. If this were to happen, sales and profit growth would be adversely affected and our stock price would be likely to decline.
Our new restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and may adversely impact the sales of our existing restaurants.
Historically, many of our new restaurants have opened with an initial ramp-up period typically lasting 24months or more, during which they generated sales and income below the levels at which we expect them to normalize. This is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new area, higher fixed costs relating to increased labor and other start-up inefficiencies that are typical of new restaurants, and a larger proportion of our recent openings being in higher rent sites than we have historically targeted. It may also be difficult for us to attract a customer base if we are not able to staff our restaurants with employees who perform to our high standards. If we are unable to build the customer base that we expect for new restaurant locations or overcome the higher fixed costs associated with new restaurant locations, new restaurants may not have similar results as our existing restaurants and may not be profitable. We also have lowered the average development cost of our new restaurants significantly in recent years, from about $916,000 in 2008 to about $800,000 in 2011, and expect development costs in 2012 to be similar to 2011. In the event we are not able to achieve the average development costs we expect for 2012 or sustain the benefits achieved in prior years, which could result from inflation, project mismanagement or other reasons, our new restaurant locations could also result in decreased profitability.
In addition, we have now opened restaurants in nearly all major metropolitan areas across the U.S. New restaurants opened in existing markets may adversely impact sales in previously-opened restaurants in the same market as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newly-opened restaurant instead. This impact could worsen as we open additional restaurants, and could make it more difficult for us to increase comparable restaurant sales and profitability. Existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build the customer base for newly-opened restaurants in the same market.
Changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Like all restaurant companies, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, generalized infectious diseases, fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, product recalls and government regulations. The cost of many basic foods for humans and animals, including corn, wheat, rice and soy oil, has increased markedly in some years, resulting in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our raw ingredients including chicken, beef, tortillas and rice, increasing our food costs. Food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly during 2011 and we expect that there will be additional pricing pressures on some of those ingredients, including beef, chicken, rice and beans, during 2012. We could also be adversely impacted by price increases specific to naturally raised meats or other food items we buy as part of our Food With Integrity focus, the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for commodity food products. Weather related issues, such as freezes or drought, may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of 11 Table of Contents some ingredients such as produce or meats. Any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as beef, chicken, cheese, avocados, beans, rice, tomatoes and pork, would adversely affect our operating results. Alternatively, in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items, such as one or more of our salsas, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients. Any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable restaurant sales.
Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.
Labor is a primary component of our operating costs, and we believe good managers and crew are a key part of our success. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew. Increased labor costs due to factors like competition, increased minimum wage requirements, employee benefits and any changes in our restaurant staffing structure would adversely impact our operating costs. Our success also depends in part on the energy and skills of our employees and our ability to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees, especially restaurant managers and crew members. Our failure to find and keep enough employees who are a good fit with our culture could delay planned restaurant openings, result in higher employee turnover or require us to change our culture, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Restaurant operators have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates. Any increase in our turnover rates for managers or crew could be costly.
Various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. This may subject us to fines or penalties, and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. For example, following an audit by the Department of Homeland Security of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in Minnesota during 2010, we lost approximately 450 employees, resulting in a temporary increase in labor costs and disruption of our operations, including slower throughput, as we trained new employees, as well as some degree of negative publicity. We are currently undergoing a similar audit in Virginia and the District of Columbia, and in April 2011 we received notice from the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division. Termination of a significant number of employees in those or other markets or across our company will disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput, and may also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. Our financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.
Because we do not franchise, risks associated with hiring and maintaining a large workforce, including increases in wage rates or the cost of employee benefits, compliance with laws and regulations related to the hiring, payment and termination of employees, and employee-related litigation, may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees.
Instances of food-borne or localized illnesses could cause the temporary closure of some restaurants or result in negative publicity, thereby resulting in a decline in our sales, and could adversely affect the price and availability of the meat, produce or dairy we use to prepare our food.
Instances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. For instance, on a small number of occasions a Chipotle restaurant has been associated with customer illness, and on those occasions our sales have been adversely impacted, at times even in markets beyond those impacted by the illness. If our customers become ill from food-borne or localized illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily 12 Table of Contents close some restaurants. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, would adversely impact our restaurant sales and profitability.
In addition, reports linking a nationwide outbreak of salmonella during the summer of 2008 to a variety of fresh produce items caused us to temporarily suspend serving some produce items in our foods or to otherwise alter our menu. Similarly, past outbreaks of E. coli relating to certain food items caused consumers to avoid certain products and restaurant chains, Asian and European countries have experienced outbreaks of avian flu, and incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as hepatitis A or norovirus) and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past, and could have in the future, an adverse affect on the price and availability of affected ingredients. If we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the Chipotle experience, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable. Customers may also shift away from us if we choose to pass along to consumers any higher ingredient costs resulting from supply problems associated with outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, which would also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability.
We may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higher-quality food.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers that food made with higher-quality ingredients is worth the prices they will pay at our restaurants relative to prices offered by some of our competitors, particularly those in the quick-service segment. We may not successfully educate customers about the quality of our food, and customers may not care even if they do understand our approach. That could require us to change our pricing, advertising or promotional strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or the brand identity that we have tried to create. Consumers may also be more price-sensitive during difficult economic times, and we experienced some decrease in traffic during late 2008 and throughout 2009 that we attribute in part to menu price increases. Recent reports have indicated continued consumer uncertainty that may persist during 2012, so our ability to increase sales may be significantly hampered for the foreseeable future. If we do elect to increase menu prices, it may adversely impact our customer traffic.
Governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harming our ability to open new restaurants.
We are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses associated with these modifications, or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material. During 2010 an appeals court in California found that the design we formerly used for our serving line had violated the ADA, and although we are continuing to defend that case, in the event we are not successful in our defense, losses in that case and related class actions may exceed our accruals and could have a material impact on us.
We are also subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome, and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, a lawsuit has been filed against us in California alleging violations of state laws regarding employee record-keeping, meal and rest breaks, payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees. We could suffer losses in this case or similar cases, and any such losses could be significant. In addition, several states in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, and these increases could 13 Table of Contents increase our labor costs. We also are audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements as well, and recent audit activity in this area is described in more detail above under Our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants . Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized our business may be disrupted as we try to replace lost workers with additional qualified employees. We could also experience adverse publicity arising from immigration-related enforcement activity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees.
From time to time we are the target of litigation in connection with various of the laws and regulations that cover our business. The majority of this litigation occurs in California even though currently only about 16% of our restaurants are located there. As we continue to expand in California, or if we are not able to effectively manage the increased litigation risks and expenses we have experienced in California, our business may be adversely impacted to a greater extent than if we did not operate in, or minimized our operations in, California.
A comprehensive U.S. health care reform law was enacted in 2010. We are evaluating the impact the new law will have on our employees. Although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have on us, we expect that our expenses will significantly increase over the long term as a result of the law, particularly in 2014 under the current version of the law, and any such increases will likely be large enough to materially impact our results of operations.
In recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menu boards or make other nutritional information available. The U.S. health care reform law included nation-wide menu labeling and nutrition disclosure requirements as well, and our restaurants are covered by these national requirements. Initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food, may increase our expenses or slow customers as they move through the line, decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.
Each of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We have, however, conducted investigations of some of our properties and identified contamination caused by third-party operations. We believe any such contamination has been or should be addressed by the third party. If the relevant third party does not address or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely, then under certain environmental laws, we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining contamination, sometimes without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Any such liability could be material. Further, we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations. We also cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws.
14 Table of Contents Because we do not franchise, the costs of compliance and other risks associated with government regulation of our business, as described above, may be more pronounced for us than for restaurant companies that shift some or all of these risks to franchisees.
Competition could adversely affect us.
The fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambience and condition of each restaurant. Our competition includes a variety of restaurants in each of these segments, including locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains. Our competitors offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. Among our main competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market Mexican food or burrito restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. In addition, our strategy includes opening additional restaurants in existing markets, and as we do so sales may decline in our previously-opened restaurants as customers who frequent our established restaurants begin to visit a newly-opened restaurant instead.
Several of our competitors compete by offering menu items that are specifically identified as low in carbohydrates, better for customers or otherwise targeted at particular consumer preferences. Many of our competitors in the fast-casual and quick-service segments of the restaurant industry also emphasize lower-cost, value meal menu options, a strategy we do not currently pursue. Our sales may be adversely affected by these products and price competition.
Moreover, new companies may enter our markets and target our customers. For example, additional competitive pressures have come more recently from the deli sections and in-store cafs of several major grocery store chains, including those targeted at customers who want higher-quality food, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. These competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations than we have.
Any of these competitive factors may adversely affect us and reduce our sales and profits.
Our Food With Integrity philosophy subjects us to risks.
Our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to adhere to the principle of Food With Integrity. We use a substantial amount of naturally raised and sustainably grown ingredients, and try to make our food as fresh as we can, in light of pricing considerations. We do, however, face challenges associated with pursuing Food With Integrity. It can take longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our criteria, and there are higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing naturally raised or sustainably grown ingredients. Growth rate and weight gain can be lower for chickens, cattle and pigs that are not fed sub-therapeutic antibiotics and for cattle that are not given growth hormones. Organic and sustainable crops can take longer to grow and crop yields can be lower for organically or sustainably grown produce. Given the costs associated with natural and sustainable farming practices, and recently due to decreased demand as a result of the weak economic environment, many large suppliers have not found it economical to pursue business in this area. Although as of December31, 2011 we served naturally raised meat in all of our restaurants in the U.S., we may experience shortages, particularly of naturally raised chicken or steak, due to suppliers suspending production, market conditions, or other forces beyond our control. A few of our markets reverted to serving conventionally raised beef in early 2012 due to supply shortages.Furthermore, as we grow, the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may be constrained. Moreover, we are broadening our commitment to serving local or organic produce and produce purchased from farmers markets when seasonally available. These initiatives may make it more difficult to keep quality consistent and present additional risk of food-borne illnesses given the greater number of suppliers involved in such a system and the difficulty imposing our quality assurance programs on all such suppliers.
15 Table of Contents Quality variations and food-borne illness concerns could adversely impact public perceptions of Food With Integrity or our brand generally.
If as a result of any of these factors we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a cost-effective basis, or at all, our food costs could increase, adversely impacting our operating margins. These factors could also cause us difficulties in aligning our brand with Food With Integrity, which could make us less popular among our customers and cause sales to decline. Our commitment to Food With Integrity may also leave us open to actions against us or criticism from special interest groups whose ideas regarding food issues differ from ours or who believe we should pursue different or additional goals with our Food With Integrity approach. Any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our brand and adversely impact customer traffic at our restaurants. We may also face adverse publicity if suppliers, without our knowledge, do not adhere to all of the elements of our Food With Integrity programs, such as naturally raised meat protocols, requirements for organic or sustainable growing methods, and similar criteria on which we base our purchasing decisions. If any such supplier failures are publicized, our reputation would be harmed and our sales may be adversely impacted.
Additionally, in response to increasing customer awareness and demand, some competitors have also begun to advertise their use of meats raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, dairy products from cows not treated with rBGH, and other ingredients similar to those we seek as part of our Food With Integrity philosophy. If competitors become known for using these types of higher-quality or more sustainable ingredients, it may make it more difficult for us to differentiate Chipotle and our restaurants, which could adversely impact our operating results.
Our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas.
Some of our new restaurants are located in or planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience. For instance, over the past two years weve opened two restaurants in London, our first restaurants outside of North America, and we plan to open a restaurant in Paris in 2012. New markets, particularly outside the United States, may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. As a result, new restaurants in those markets may be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets. Consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the Chipotle brand, and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision, passion and culture. Restaurants opened in new markets, particularly outside the United States, may also have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants opened in existing markets, and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than restaurants in existing markets. We may also have difficulty finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us, either initially or over time, with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels, and may never do so, thereby affecting our overall profitability. Some or all of these factors may be more pronounced in markets outside the United States due to cultural, regulatory or economic differences with which we are not familiar, which may have a particularly adverse impact on our sales or profitability in those markets and could thereby adversely impact our overall results. Our overall results may also be affected by currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar.
ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen may not contribute to our growth.
We believe that the fundamental principles on which Chipotle restaurants are basedfinding the very best sustainably raised ingredients, prepared and cooked using classical methods in front of the customer, and served in an interactive format by special people dedicated to providing a great dining experiencecan be adapted to cuisines other than the food we serve at Chipotle. In order to see how our model works when we use different ingredients and a different style of food, we opened ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen during 2011. Notwithstanding our opening of ShopHouse and our plans to open one additional ShopHouse restaurant during 16 Table of Contents 2012, our immediate focus will remain on thoughtfully growing the Chipotle brand. As a result, we do not expect ShopHouse to contribute to our growth in a meaningful way for at least the next several years, and we may determine not to move forward with the expansion of ShopHouse at all. This might limit our overall growth over the long term.
We expect general and administrative expenses to increase significantly during 2012.
Stock compensation awards are an important element of our compensation programs. Accounting rules require that we record non-cash stock-based compensation expense in connection with any stock compensation awards, with the expense recorded for stock-only stock appreciation rights, or SOSARs, determined by valuing the awards based on a number of accepted valuation methodologies. As a result of the significant increase in the price of our common stock, the computed value of SOSAR awards (and the associated non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be recorded) has increased significantly in recent years. Non-cash stock based compensation expense totaled approximately $43 million in 2011, and we expect that amount to increase by at least 50 percent for 2012 based on the higher stock price used to compute the value of SOSARs awarded during 2012, as well as the potential for additional expense associated with performance shares if they are determined to be probable to vest at a higher level. This significant increase will adversely impact our general and administrative expense for 2012. Our general and administrative expense for 2012 will also be impacted by up to $5.0 million in expenses associated with our biennial All Managers Conference, which we will hold during the third quarter of 2012. These increases in general and administrative expense will adversely impact our operating income and earnings per share during 2012.
We could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies.
Were subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future. Our customers also occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that were responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. See Governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including by harming our ability to open new restaurants, above, for a description of particular claims of this type. From time to time, we also face claims alleging that technology we use in our business infringes patents held by third parties. We believe the number of all of the foregoing types of claims has increased as our business has grown and we have become more visible to potential plaintiffs and their lawyers. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether were ultimately held liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.
Failure to receive frequent deliveries of higher-quality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations.
Our ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, inclement weather, a supplier ceasing operations or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of our ingredients, which could harm our operations. We have almost no long-term contracts with suppliers, and we have relied largely on the same third party distribution network as McDonalds Corporation. If any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. We currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our key ingredients, including beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream and tortillas. Due to the unique nature of the products we receive from our Food With Integrity 17 Table of Contents suppliers and as described in more detail above, these suppliers could be more difficult to replace if we were no longer able to rely on them. If we have to seek new suppliers and service providers we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants, which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu. If that were to happen and customers change their dining habits as a result, affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter. Our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe.
Changes in customer tastes and preferences, spending patterns and demographic trends could cause sales to decline.
Changes in customer preferences, general economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants affect the restaurant industry. Our sales could be impacted by changes in consumer preferences in response to dietary concerns, including preferences regarding items such as calories, sodium, carbohydrates or fat. These changes could result in consumers avoiding our menu items in favor of other foods. Our success also depends to a significant extent on consumer confidence, which is influenced by general economic conditions and discretionary income levels. Negative consumer sentiment in the wake of the economic downturn has been widely reported over the past three years and according to some forecasts will continue during 2012. Our sales may decline during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty, which can be caused by various factors such as high gasoline prices, high unemployment, declining home prices, tight credit markets or foreign political or economic unrest. Any material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family food away from home spending could cause our sales, operating results, profits, business or financial condition to decline. If we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences and trends, we may lose customers and our sales may deteriorate.
Our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.
Our plans call for a significant number of new restaurants. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain restaurant managers and crew. We also are continuing to revise our field management structure, in an effort to develop additional top-performing restaurant managers more quickly. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on management, crew and existing infrastructure, and changes to our operating structure may result in increased costs or inefficiencies that we cannot currently anticipate. Changes as we grow may have a negative impact on the operation of our restaurants, and cost increases resulting from our inability to effectively manage our growth could adversely impact our profitability. We also place a lot of importance on our culture, which we believe has been an important contributor to our success. As we grow, we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. Our failure to foster and maintain our corporate culture could also harm our business and operating results.
Our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims.
We maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers compensation, general liability and property damage. We are self-insured for our health plans, and have purchased a fully-insured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs.We are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers compensation, general liability and property damage insurance.
For policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on 18 Table of Contents historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
Our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
Our Chairman and co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells founded our company, has been the principal architect of our business strategy, and has led our growth from a single restaurant in 1993 to over 1,200 restaurants today. Monty Moran, our co-Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Hartung, our Chief Financial Officer, have also served with us for several years and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership or a new management team were to change or be unsuccessful in implementing our strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.
We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information.
We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. During 2011 approximately 60% of our sales were attributable to credit and debit card transactions, and credit and debit card usage could continue to increase. A number of retailers, including us, have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. In August2004, the merchant bank that processed our credit and debit card transactions informed us that we may have been the victim of a possible theft of card data. As a result, we recorded losses and related expenses totaling $4.3 million from 2004 through 2006.
We may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.
Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos, our Food With Integrity strategy and the unique ambience of our restaurants. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items, logos and other branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property, and our ability to halt these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully expand into other jurisdictions in the future. We may also encounter claims from prior users of similar intellectual property in areas where we operate or intend to conduct operations. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs.
19 Table of Contents Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors.
Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors, including:  changes in comparable restaurant sales and customer visits, including as a result of declining consumer confidence or the introduction of new menu items;  the timing of new restaurant openings and related revenues and expenses;  operating costs at newly opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation;  labor availability and wages of restaurant management and crew, as well as temporary fluctuations in labor costs as a result of large-scale changes in workforce;  profitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets;  fluctuations in supply costs, particularly for our most significant food items;  our ability to raise menu prices without adversely impacting customer traffic;  the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities, such as freezes that have impacted produce crops;  variations in general economic conditions, including the impact of declining interest rates on our interest income;  negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at our restaurants;  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;  increases in infrastructure costs;  tax expenses, impairment charges and other non-operating costs; and  potential distraction or unusual expenses associated with our expansion into international markets or initiatives to explore new concepts.
Seasonal factors also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our restaurant sales are typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather (because fewer people are eating out) and higher during the spring, summer and fall months (for the opposite reason). Our restaurant sales will also vary as a result of the number of trading days, that is, the number of days in a quarter when a restaurant is open.
As a result of these factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. Average restaurant sales or comparable restaurant sales in any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to fall. We believe the market price of our common stock reflects high market expectations for our future operating results, and as a result, if we fail to meet market expectations for our operating results in the future, any resulting decline in the price of our common stock could be significant.
Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from McDonalds could adversely affect us.
McDonalds Corporation was our majority owner from 2000 until October 2006. We understand that the exchange offer McDonalds completed in October 2006 to dispose of its interest in us was generally tax-free to McDonalds and its shareholders. In order to protect the tax-free status of the exchange offer, in the separation agreement we entered into with McDonalds in connection with the separation we agreed among other things to indemnify McDonalds for taxes and related losses it incurs as a result of the exchange failing to qualify as a 20 Table of Contents tax-free transaction in certain situations, if the taxes and related losses are attributable to (i)certain direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets (regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions); (ii)negotiations, understandings, agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions; or (iii)any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that affects the relative voting rights of any separate classes of our common stock. In December 2009, following completion of an extensive due diligence process, we completed a share conversion eliminating the existence of our class B common stock, and with it the superior voting rights of the class B common stock. In the event the share conversion is deemed to result in the McDonalds exchange offer failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction, we may have an indemnification obligation under the provision described above. We currently estimate that the indemnification obligation to McDonalds could exceed $450 million, and this estimate does not take into account related losses and depends upon several factors that are beyond our control. As a consequence, the indemnity to McDonalds could vary substantially from the estimate and may be much greater.
Our anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Certain provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain some provisions that may make the acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors more difficult, including provisions relating to the nomination, election and removal of directors, the structure of the board of directors and limitations on actions by our shareholders. In addition, Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Any of these provisions, as well as the provisions of our separation agreement with McDonalds described above under Restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax treatment of the exchange offer through which we separated from McDonalds could adversely affect us, may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders.

ITEM3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS California ADA Cases In 2006, Maurizio Antoninetti filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, primarily claiming that the height of the serving line wall in our restaurants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, as well as California disability laws. On December6, 2006, Mr.Antoninetti filed an additional lawsuit in the same court making the same allegations on a class action basis, on behalf of himself and a purported class of disabled individuals, and a similar class action was filed by James Perkins in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May7, 2008.
In the individual Antoninetti action, the district court entered a ruling in which it found that although our counter height violated the ADA, we provided the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation, and awarded attorneys fees and minimal damages to the plaintiff which we have accrued. We and the plaintiff appealed the district courts ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on July26, 2010, the appeals court entered a ruling finding that we violated the ADA and did not provide the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation, and remanded the case to the district court. The district court will now determine the damages and injunctive relief and final award of attorneys fees to which Antoninetti is entitled based on the court of appeals ruling.
We lowered the height of our serving line walls throughout California some time ago, which makes injunctive relief in both the individual and class actions moot, and have the lower serving line walls in a significant majority of our restaurants outside of California as well. We will vigorously defend the class action cases, including by contesting certification of a plaintiff class. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of, or any additional potential liability from, these cases.
Notices of Inspection of Work Authorization Documents Following an inspection during 2010 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, of the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in Minnesota, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm of DHS, or ICE, issued to us a Notice of Suspect Documents identifying a large number of employees who, according to ICE and notwithstanding our review of work authorization documents for each employee at the time they were hired, appeared not to be authorized to work in the U.S. We approached each of the named employees to explain ICEs determination and afforded each employee an opportunity to confirm the validity of their original work eligibility documents, or provide valid work eligibility documents. Employees who were unable to provide valid work eligibility documents were terminated in accordance with the law. In December 2010, we were also requested by DHS to provide the work authorization documents of our restaurant employees in the District of Columbia and Virginia, and we provided the requested documents in January 2011. We have received additional requests for work authorization documents covering a small number of individual restaurants as well, and ICEs investigation remains ongoing. In April 2011, we also received notice from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division. The operating hours of our Minnesota, D.C. and Virginia restaurants have been uninterrupted by these developments, and we believe our practices with regard to the work authorization of our employees, including the review and retention of work authorization documents, are in compliance with applicable law. However, the termination of large numbers of employees in a short period of time does disrupt our operations and results in a temporary increase in labor costs as we train new employees. It is not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur any fines, penalties or further liabilities in connection with these matters.
23 Table of Contents Miscellaneous A lawsuit has been filed against us in California alleging violations of state laws regarding employee record-keeping, meal and rest breaks, payment of overtime and related practices with respect to our employees. The case originally sought damages, penalties and attorneys fees on behalf of a purported class of our present and former employees. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify the purported class and the California Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, and as a result the action can proceed, if at all, as an action by a single plaintiff. The plaintiff has appealed the courts denial of class certification, and the appeal remains pending. Although the limitation to a single-plaintiff action significantly minimizes our current potential exposure from the case and we have various defenses, due to the possibility of further appeals and the uncertainties of litigation it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of, or any potential liability, from this case.
Were involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

25 Table of Contents Dividend Policy We are not required to pay any dividends and have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to continue to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN The following graph compares the cumulative annual stockholders return on our common stock from December31, 2006 through December31, 2011 to that of the total return index for the S&P 500, the S&P 500 Restaurants Index, and the S&P SmallCap 600 Restaurants Index assuming an investment of $100 on December31, 2006. In calculating total annual stockholder return, reinvestment of dividends, if any, is assumed. Historically we have compared the total return of Chipotle common stock to the total return index for the S&P SmallCap 600 Restaurants. We have chosen to replace the S&P SmallCap 600 Restaurants Index in these comparisons for future years with the S&P 500 Restaurants Index, because our market capitalization has become considerably larger than the average and median market capitalization of companies included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Restaurants Index. SEC rules require that we include the S&P SmallCap 600 Restaurants Index in the comparison for this year. The indices are included for comparative purposes only. They do not necessarily reflect managements opinion that such indices are an appropriate measure of the relative performance of our common stock. This graph is not soliciting material, is not deemed filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not to be incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations.

Overview Chipotle operates fresh Mexican food restaurants serving burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. We began with a simple philosophy: demonstrate that food served fast doesnt have to be a traditional fast-food experience. We do this by avoiding a formulaic approach when creating our restaurant experience, looking to fine dining restaurants for inspiration. We use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and distinctive interior design, and have friendly people to take care of each customerfeatures that are more frequently found in the world of fine dining. Through our vision of Food With Integrity, Chipotle is seeking better food from using ingredients that are not only fresh, but that where possible are sustainably grown and naturally raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce the food. A similarly focused people culture, with an emphasis on identifying and empowering top performing employees, enables us to develop future leaders from within.
2011 Highlights and Trends Restaurant Development . As of December31, 2011, we had 1,230 restaurants, of which 1,226 were located throughout the United States, two located in Toronto, Canada, and two located in London, England. New restaurants have contributed substantially to our restaurant sales growth. We opened 150 restaurants in 2011, including one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen, our new concept serving bowls and banh mi sandwiches. We expect to open between 155 and 165 restaurants in 2012. Among the expected restaurant openings in 2012 is a restaurant in Paris, France, which will be our first restaurant in France, and one ShopHouse. We plan about 30% of the 2012 openings to be what we call A Model restaurants. A Model locations are being built primarily in secondary trade areas which have attractive demographics but are typically characterized by lower investment and occupancy costs than our recent traditional restaurant openings. Our introduction of A Model restaurants and our new, simpler design, which incorporates some A Model design elements, enabled us to lower the average development costs for new restaurants from about $850,000 in 2009 to about $800,000 in 2011. We anticipate average development costs for new restaurants to be opened in 2012 to be similar to 2011.
Sales Growth . Average restaurant sales were $2.013 million as of December31, 2011, increasing from $1.840 million as of December31, 2010. We define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12-month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Our comparable restaurant sales increases were 11.2% in 2011 and were driven primarily by an increase in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year benefiting comparable restaurant sales by 2.9%. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation. Due to the uncertain economic environment and difficult comparisons with 2011, we expect 2012 comparable restaurant sales increases to be in the mid single digits.
Food With Integrity.
By the end of 2011, we were serving naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants in the U.S.We define naturally raised as coming from animals that are never given antibiotics or added hormones and that are raised responsiblythat is, in accordance with our animal welfare standards. In addition, a portion of some of the produce items we serve is organically grown, or sourced locally when in season (by which we mean within 350 miles of our restaurant), and a portion of the beans we serve is organically grown and a portion is grown using conservation tillage methods that improve soil conditions, reduce erosion and help preserve the environment in which they are grown. All of the sour cream and cheese we buy is made from milk that comes from cows that are not given rBGH. Milk used to make much of our cheese and a portion of our sour cream is 28 Table of Contents sourced from dairies that provide an even higher standard of animal welfare by providing pasture access for their cows.We will continue to search for ingredients that not only taste delicious, but also benefit local farmers or the environment, or otherwise benefit or improve the sustainability of our supply chain.
Continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our primary goals, but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011, a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints.
Our food costs increased in 2011 as a result of inflationary pressures on almost all of our ingredients, particularly avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase.
Stock Repurchases.
In accordance with stock repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors we purchased stock with an aggregate total repurchase price of $63.5 million during 2011. As of December31, 2011, $6.6 million was available to be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization. On February1, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the expenditure of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We have entered into an agreement with a broker under SEC rule 10b5-1(c), authorizing the broker to make open market purchases of common stock from time to time, subject to market conditions. The existing repurchase agreement and the Boards authorization of the repurchases may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
Restaurant Openings, Relocations and Closures The following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated.

As our business grows, as we open more restaurants and hire more employees, our restaurant operating costs and depreciation and amortization increase.
Revenue For the years ended December31 % increase 2011over 2010 % increase 2010over 2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 2,269.5 $ 1,835.9 $ 1,518.4 23.6 % 20.9 % Average restaurant sales $ 2.013 $ 1.840 $ 1.728 9.4 % 6.5 % Comparable restaurant sales increase 11.2 % 9.4 % 2.2 % Number of restaurants as of the end of the year 1,230 1,084 956 13.5 % 13.4 % Number of restaurants opened in the year, net of closures and relocations 146 128 119 29 Table of Contents The significant factors contributing to our increases in sales were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. Restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable base contributed to $237.9 million of the increase in sales in 2011, of which $92.8 million was attributable to restaurants opened during the year. In 2010, restaurant sales from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed to $178.7 million of the increase in sales, of which $75.2 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2010.
Comparable restaurant sales increases contributed $195.6 million and $138.7 million of the increase in restaurant sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales growth in 2011 was due primarily to increases in customer visits, as well as the impact of menu price increases implemented during the year. The increase in 2010 was primarily driven by increases in customer visits.
Food, Beverage and Packaging Costs For the years ended December31 % increase 2011over 2010 % increase 2010over 2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Food, beverage and packaging $ 738.7 $ 561.1 $ 466.0 31.7 % 20.4 % As a percentage of revenue 32.5 % 30.6 % 30.7 % Food, beverage and packaging costs increased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 due to inflation on most food items, including avocados, beef, chicken, and dairy, partially offset by the impact of menu price increases. We expect that food cost inflation will continue in 2012 and that our food costs as a percentage of revenue will increase.
Food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 due primarily to favorable food costs, primarily rice, corn and chicken as a result of our switch to commodity chicken in certain markets due to supply constraints, partially offset by the increased cost of barbacoa and steak as we increased the percentage of naturally raised beef we served in our restaurants.

Occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2010 primarily due to the benefit of higher average sales on a partially fixed-cost base. The benefit of the lower occupancy costs from the A Model restaurants was offset by opening proportionately more restaurants in more expensive areas.

These increases were partially offset by costs from the biennial all manager conference held during the third quarter of 2010.
The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the stock-based compensation awards granted in 2010, costs from the biennial all manager conference, and hiring more employees as we grew.
We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2012, which takes into consideration that we anticipate materially higher stock-based compensation expense than 2011 due to our higher stock price, as well as expenses related to the biennial all manager conference to be held in the third quarter of 2012.

Income Tax Provision For the years ended December31 % increase 2011over 2010 % increase 2010over 2009 2011 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) Income tax provision $ 134.8 $ 110.1 $ 77.4 22.4 % 42.3 % Effective tax rate 38.5 % 38.1 % 37.9 % The 2011 effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in the state rate, smaller benefit from food donations and one-time adjustments partially offset by the one-time employment tax credits.We estimate our 2012 annual effective tax rate will be 39.3%. However, if certain federal tax credits weve benefitted from in 2011 are renewed by Congress, we estimate our annual effective tax rate would be lower by up to 0.4%.
The 2010 effective tax rate increased primarily due to a one-time benefit recognized in 2009 for prior period meals and entertainment deductions.
Quarterly Financial Data/Seasonality The following table presents consolidated statement of income data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December31, 2011. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.
2011 Quarters Ended Mar.31 June30 Sept.30 Dec.31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 509.4 $ 571.6 $ 591.9 $ 596.7 Operating income $ 74.8 $ 83.9 $ 98.0 $ 93.9 Net income $ 46.4 $ 50.7 $ 60.4 $ 57.5 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 12 39 32 67 Comparable restaurant sales increase 12.4 % 10.0 % 11.3 % 11.1 % 2010 Quarters Ended Mar.31 June30 Sept.30 Dec.31 (dollars in millions) Revenue $ 409.7 $ 466.8 $ 476.9 $ 482.5 Operating income $ 61.3 $ 75.0 $ 77.6 $ 73.9 Net income $ 37.8 $ 46.5 $ 48.2 $ 46.4 Number of restaurants opened in quarter 20 25 22 62 Comparable restaurant sales increase 4.3 % 8.7 % 11.4 % 12.6 % Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of 32 Table of Contents mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results. Overall, on an annual basis, changes in trading dates do not have a significant impact on our results.
Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter and unanticipated events. New restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. In addition, unanticipated events also impact our results. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, working capital and general corporate needs. We have a cash and short-term investment balance of $456.2 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business (primarily through opening restaurants), to repurchase up to an additional $106.6 million of our common stock subject to market conditions, to continue to maintain our existing restaurants and for general corporate purposes. We also have a long term investments balance of $128.2 million, which consists of U.S. treasury notes and certificate of deposit products with maturities of 13 months to approximately 2 years. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash balance, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
We havent required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
While operations continue to provide cash, our primary use of cash is in new restaurant development. Our total capital expenditures for 2011 were $151.1 million, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of about $160 million to $170 million in 2012, of which $138 million relates to our construction of new restaurants before any reductions for landlord reimbursements, and the remainder primarily relates to restaurant reinvestments. In 2011, we spent on average about $800,000 in development and construction costs per restaurant, net of landlord reimbursements. The average development and construction costs per restaurant decreased from about $850,000 in 2009 due to cost savings realized, in part, from certain cost reduction efforts associated with the development of the A Model strategy and our new, simpler restaurant design. For new restaurants to be opened in 2012 we anticipate average development costs to be similar to 2011.
Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December31, 2011 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1year 2-3years 4-5years After 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 2,116,395 $ 133,813 $ 271,911 $ 275,512 $ 1,435,159 Deemed landlord financing 5,898 394 788 821 3,895 Other contractual obligations (1) 73,455 69,370 4,085   Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,195,748 $ 203,577 $ 276,784 $ 276,333 $ 1,439,054 (1) We enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and corporate sponsorships.
33 Table of Contents Were obligated under non-cancelable leases for our restaurants and administrative offices. Our leases generally have initial terms of either five to ten years with two or more five-year extensions, for end-cap and in-line restaurants, or 15 to 20years with several five-year extensions, for free-standing restaurants. Our leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common charges and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we generally do not expect to pay significant contingent rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
Inflation The primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, fuel, utility costs, materials used in the construction of our restaurants, and insurance. Although almost all of our crew members make more than the minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs. Additionally, many of our leases require us to pay taxes, maintenance, utilities and insurance, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases.
Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in Note1 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Leases We lease most of our restaurant locations. Our leases contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. We account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term including reasonably assured renewal periods. We have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years. If the estimate of our reasonably assured lease terms were changed our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the awards fair value. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or SOSARs, which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. The volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. Similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards and SOSARs with performance-based vesting conditions is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance SOSARs. We determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. Those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. Had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our SOSARs, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance SOSARs, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.
34 Table of Contents Insurance Liability We maintain various insurance policies for workers compensation, general liability and auto damage with varying deductibles as high as $500,000, and for property which has a $1 million deductible. We are self insured for employee health but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. We record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. In addition, our history of claims experience is short and our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded. Actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. The total estimated insurance liabilities as of December31, 2011 were $21.7 million.
Reserves/Contingencies for Litigation and Other Matters We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. Consequently, we were unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December31, 2011 and 2010. Once resolved, however, these actions may affect our operating results and cash flows.
Unredeemed Gift Card Balances We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and from which we do not deduct non-usage fees. We recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company specific historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a period of six months beginning at the date of the gift card sale. We have determined 5% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by us. Any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage revenue recognized in future periods.
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Changing Interest Rates Were exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. As of December31, 2011, we had $382.8 million in investments, including a trust account classified in other assets, and $204.0 million in FDIC insured accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.36%.
Commodity Price Risks We are also exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are commodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices.
35 Table of Contents However, a portion of the dollar value of goods purchased by us is effectively at spot prices. Generally our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 18 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. Weve tried to increase, where necessary, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose not to increase menu prices at the same pace for competitive or other reasons.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the U.S. and therefore our foreign currency risk is limited at this date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollar and share amounts in thousands, unless otherwise specified) 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Chipotle Mexican Grill,Inc. (the Company), a Delaware corporation, develops and operates fast-casual, fresh Mexican food restaurants throughout the United States. The Company also has two restaurants in Toronto, Canada and two in London, England and operates one ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen. The Company manages its operations based on six regions and has aggregated its operations to one reportable segment.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold. The Company reports revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities.
The Company sells gift cards which do not have an expiration date and it does not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when: (i)the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii)the Company determines the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. The determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon Company-specific historical redemption patterns. The Company has determined that 5% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained by the Company. Gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis over a six month period beginning at the date of the gift card sale. Gift card breakage is included in total revenue in the consolidated statement of income. Breakage recognized during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1,524, $1,188 and $878, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable primarily consists of tenant improvement receivables and vendor rebates. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable based on a specific review of account balances. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recoverability is considered remote.
43 Table of Contents Inventory Inventory, consisting principally of food, beverages, and supplies, is valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. Certain key ingredients (beef, pork, chicken, beans, rice, sour cream, and tortillas) are purchased from a small number of suppliers.
Investments The Companys investments consist of U.S. treasury notes and CDARS, certificate of deposit products, with maturities up to approximately two years and classified as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which the Company has determined approximates fair value as of December31, 2011 and 2010. Fair market value of U.S. treasury notes is measured on a recurring basis based on Level 1 inputs and fair market value of CDARS is measured on a recurring basis based on Level 2 inputs (level inputs are described below under Fair Value Measurements). The Company recognizes impairment charges on its investments in the consolidated statement of income when management believes the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary. No impairment charges were recognized on the Companys investments for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Leasehold Improvements, Property and Equipment Leasehold improvements, property and equipment are recorded at cost. Internal costs directly associated with the acquisition, development and construction of a restaurant are capitalized and were $9,616, $8,167 and $6,916 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, which generally includes reasonably assured option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the accounts are relieved of cost and accumulated depreciation and the related gain or loss is reflected in loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of income.
At least annually, the Company evaluates, and adjusts when necessary, the estimated useful lives. The changes in estimated useful lives did not have a material impact on depreciation in any period. The estimated useful lives are: Leasehold improvements and buildings 3-20years Furniture and fixtures 3-10years Equipment 3-7 years Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of the business acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, and the Company is required to record any necessary impairment adjustments. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill. Based on the Companys analysis, no impairment charges were recognized on goodwill for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of insurance related restricted trust assets of $15,313 and $7,800 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, transferable liquor licenses which are carried at the lower of fair value or cost, and a prepaid tax asset related to an intercompany transfer of international intellectual property.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment, assets are grouped together at the market level. The Company manages its 44 Table of Contents restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurants cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, an aggregate impairment charge of $380, $751 and $0, respectively, was recognized in loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statement of income. The impairment charges resulted primarily from office or restaurant closures. Fair value of the restaurants was determined using Level 3 inputs (as described below under Fair Value Measurements) based on a discounted cash flows method at a market level through the estimated date of closure.
Income Taxes The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. The deferred income tax impacts of investment tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. When it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, the Company provides a corresponding valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. When it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company measures the amount of tax benefit from the position and records the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized after settlement with a tax authority. The Companys policy is to recognize interest to be paid on an underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and any related statutory penalties in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income.
Restaurant Pre-Opening Costs Pre-opening costs, including rent, wages, benefits and travel for the training and opening teams, food and other restaurant operating costs, are expensed as incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business.
Insurance Liability The Company maintains various insurance policies including workers compensation, employee health, general liability and property damage. Pursuant to these policies, the Company is responsible for losses up to certain limits and is required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. This liability is based on managements estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. If actual trends differ from the estimates, the financial results could be impacted. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, $17,437 and $13,426, respectively, of the estimated liability was included in accrued payroll and benefits and $4,250 and $3,242, respectively, was included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Advertising and Marketing Costs Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $31,902, $26,190 and $20,997 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Advertising and marketing costs are included in other operating costs in the consolidated statement of income.
Rent Rent expense for the Companys leases, which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term is the lesser of 20 years, including reasonably assured renewal periods, or the lease term. The lease term begins when the Company has the right to control the 45 Table of Contents use of the property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the lease. The difference between the rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheet. Pre-opening rent is included in pre-opening costs in the consolidated income statement. Tenant incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions of rent expense over the term of the lease.
Additionally, certain of the Companys operating leases contain clauses that provide additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. The Company recognizes contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers contingent rent, provided the achievement of that target is considered probable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.
Fair Value Measurements Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 820, Fair Value of Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) defines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
Foreign Currency Translation The Companys international operations generally use the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivables. Approximately one third of the Companys cash and investment balances are not federally backed or federally insured. Credit card transactions at the Companys restaurant are processed by one service provider. Concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivables are limited, as the Companys receivables are primarily with its landlords for the reimbursements of tenant improvements.
Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements through the date of issuance.
46 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2011, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011-08 simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15,2011. The Company believes the adoption of ASU 2011-05 concerns presentation and disclosure only and will not have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No.2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This pronouncement was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
2. Supplemental Financial Information Leasehold improvements, property and equipment were as follows: December31 2011 2010 Land $ 11,062 $ 11,062 Leasehold improvements and buildings 849,102 743,439 Furniture and fixtures 89,180 78,759 Equipment 172,776 148,849 1,122,120 982,109 Accumulated depreciation (370,169 ) (305,228 ) $ 751,951 $ 676,881 Accrued liabilities were as follows: December31 2011 2010 Gift card liability $ 18,012 $ 13,456 Transaction tax payable 12,121 10,280 Other accrued expenses 16,323 15,156 $ 46,456 $ 38,892 47 Table of Contents 3. Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: Years ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Current tax: U.S. Federal $ 100,983 $ 83,850 $ 56,945 U.S. State 21,848 15,745 12,151 Foreign (6 ) 6 (139 ) 122,825 99,601 68,957 Deferred tax: U.S. Federal 12,080 10,058 9,677 U.S. State (50 ) 6 (1,393 ) Foreign (711 )  (2 ) 11,319 10,064 8,282 Valuation allowance 616 415 141 Total provision for income taxes $ 134,760 $ 110,080 $ 77,380 The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rates as follows: YearsendedDecember31 2011 2010 2009 Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of related federal income tax benefit 4.1 3.5 3.4 Other (0.6 ) (0.4 ) (0.5 ) Effective income tax rates 38.5 % 38.1 % 37.9 % Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These temporary differences consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
48 Table of Contents Deferred income tax liabilities are taxes the Company expects to pay in future periods. Similarly, deferred income tax assets are recorded for expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods. Deferred income taxes arise because of the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax liabilities and assets consist of the following: December31 2011 2010 Long-term deferred income tax liability: Leasehold improvements, property and equipment $ 127,706 $ 96,399 Goodwill and other assets 990 815 Total long-term deferred income tax liability 128,696 97,214 Long-term deferred income tax asset: Deferred rent 35,645 30,806 Gift card liability 373 271 Capitalized transaction costs 504 502 Stock-based compensation and other employee benefits 28,079 15,548 Foreign net operating loss carry-forwards 1,397 617 Valuation allowance (1,683 ) (1,055 ) Total long-term deferred income tax asset 64,315 46,689 Net long-term deferred income tax liability 64,381 50,525 Current deferred income tax liability: Prepaid assets and other 1,982 1,532 Total current deferred income tax liability 1,982 1,532 Current deferred income tax asset: Allowances, reserves and other 8,094 5,912 Other employee benefits 234 45 Valuation allowance (108 ) (108 ) Total current deferred income tax asset 8,220 5,849 Net current deferred income tax asset 6,238 4,317 Total deferred income tax liability $ 58,143 $ 46,208 As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. There was no change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the year or in prior periods or due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapses of applicable statutes of limitations. The Company is open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2008. For the majority of states where the Company has a significant presence, it is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2007. The Companys foreign net operating losses begin expiring in 2028.
4. Shareholders Equity Through December31, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized three separate plans to repurchase shares of common stock, which combined authorize expenditures of up to $300 million. The shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. The shares of common stock repurchased under authorized programs were 220, 828 and 1,298 for a total cost of $63,508, $115,885 and $84,089 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December31, 2011, $6,554 was available to be repurchased under the current agreement. The 3,038 shares are being held in treasury until such time as they are reissued or retired, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
49 Table of Contents On February1, 2012, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million to repurchase shares of common stock.
During 2010, the Company repurchased shares of common stock from participants of stock incentive plans, which are netted and surrendered as payment for applicable tax withholding on the vesting of their stock awards. Shares surrendered by the participants in accordance with the stock incentive plan and the applicable award agreements are deemed repurchased by the Company but are not part of publicly announced share repurchase programs. In the year ended 2010, the Company repurchased 67 shares for a total cost of $10,717.
5. Stock Based Compensation The Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Incentive Plan) was approved at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders on May25, 2011. Shares issued prior to the 2011 Incentive Plan were issued subject to previous stock plans. For purposes of counting the shares remaining available under the 2011 Incentive Plan, each share issuable pursuant to outstanding full value awards, such as restricted stock units and performance shares, will count as two shares used, whereas each share underlying a stock appreciation right or stock option will count as one share used. Under the 2011 Incentive Plan, 3,360 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees, of which 3,357 represent shares that were authorized for issuance but not issued at December31, 2011. The 2011 Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which has the authority to select the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to determine the type of awards and when the awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each award, the vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of the awards. The exercise price for stock awards granted under the 2011 Incentive Plan cannot be less than fair market value at the date of grant.
The Company granted stock options prior to 2008, and has granted stock only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs) since that time. SOSARs vest equally over two and three years and expire after seven years. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion. Compensation expense related to employees eligible to retire and retain full rights to the awards is recognized over six months which coincides with the notice period. Compensation expense on performance shares, which is based on the quantity of awards the Company has determined are probable of vesting, is recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense, including options, SOSARs and stock awards, was $42,965 ($26,166 net of tax) in 2011, $22,280 ($13,713 net of tax) in 2010 and $15,665 ($9,663 net of tax) in 2009. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $1,583, $899 and $673, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense was recognized as capitalized development and is included in leasehold improvements, property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet.

The total intrinsic value of options and SOSARs exercised during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $113,752, $32,957 and $31,753. Unearned compensation as of December31, 2011 was $35,587 for options and SOSAR awards. The remaining vesting period as of December31, 2011 for unvested options and SOSAR awards was between 0.1 and 2.1 years.
A summary of non-vested stock award activity under the stock incentive plans is as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 2011 2010 2009 Shares GrantDate Fair Value Shares GrantDate Fair Value Shares GrantDate Fair Value Outstanding, beginning of year 205 $ 148.22 257 $ 71.03 229 $ 75.06 Granted 6 $ 272.28 118 $ 215.76 90 $ 55.71 Vested (3 ) $ 87.36 (166 ) $ 78.85 (60 ) $ 63.89 Forfeited (1 ) $ 53.36 (4 ) $ 53.36 (2 ) $ 53.36 Outstanding, end of year 207 $ 153.40 205 $ 148.22 257 $ 71.03 At December31, 2011, 111 of the outstanding non-vested stock awards were subject to both service and performance conditions. The quantity of shares that ultimately vest is determined based on the cumulative cash flow from operations reached during the three year period ending on September30, 2013. If the cumulative cash flow from operations during the three year period does not reach a specified level, no shares will vest. Unearned compensation as of December31, 2011 was $9,049 for non-vested stock awards the Company has determined are probable of vesting. The remaining vesting period as of December31, 2011 for non-vested stock awards was between 0 and 2.1 years. The fair value of shares earned as of the vesting date during the year ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $961 and $25,369, and $3,330, respectively.
The following table reflects the average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value SOSAR awards granted for each year: 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 1.5 % 1.5 % Expected life (years) 3.4 3.4 4.2 Expected dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Volatility 51 % 51 % 42 % Weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value per share at date of grant $ 101.91 $ 39.52 $ 18.85 The Company has not paid dividends to date and does not plan to pay dividends in the near future. The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury rates for instruments with similar terms. The expected life and volatility assumptions were based on Company-specific historical data.
6. Employee Benefit Plans The Company maintains the Chipotle Mexican Grill 401(k) plan (the 401(k) Plan). The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed.
51 Table of Contents Employees become eligible to receive matching contributions after one year of service with the Company. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Company matching contributions totaled approximately $2,039, $1,734 and $1,462, respectively.
The Company maintains the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Supplemental Deferred Investment Plan (the Deferred Plan) which covers eligible employees of the Company. The Deferred Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions that cannot be made under the 401(k) Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. Participants earnings on contributions made to the Deferred Plan fluctuate with the actual earnings and losses of a variety of available investment choices selected by the participant. Total liabilities under the Deferred Plan as of December31, 2011 and 2010 were $6,802 and $5,115, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed once the 401(k) contribution limits are reached. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company made deferred compensation matches of $179, $156 and $131 respectively, to the Deferred Plan. As the Deferred Plan is unfunded, the Company is responsible for the earnings and losses. The total expense recognized under the Deferred Plan including the matching contributions was $20, $610 and $538 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
In February 2012, the Company began offering an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), which was approved at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders on May25, 2011. Under the ESPP, 250 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees. Employees become eligible to contribute after one year of service with the Company and may contribute up to 15% of their base earnings, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount, toward the monthly purchase of the Companys common stock.
7. Leases The Company generally operates its restaurants in leased premises. Lease terms for traditional shopping center or building leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 20-25years. Ground leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 30-50years. The option terms in each of these leases are typically in five-year increments. Typically, the lease includes rent escalation terms every five years including fixed rent escalations, escalations based on inflation indexes, and fair market value adjustments. Certain leases contain contingent rental provisions based upon the sales of the underlying restaurants. The leases generally provide for the payment of common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance and various other use and occupancy costs by the Company. In addition, the Company is the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices.
Future minimum lease payments required under existing operating leases as of December31, 2011 are as follows: 2012 $ 133,813 2013 135,247 2014 136,664 2015 137,527 2016 137,985 Thereafter 1,435,159 Total minimum lease payments $ 2,116,395 Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $6,756 due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.
52 Table of Contents Rental expense consists of the following: For the years ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Minimum rentals $ 130,827 $ 114,750 $ 101,029 Contingent rentals $ 1,754 $ 1,602 $ 1,500 Sublease rental income $ (1,390 ) $ (1,227 ) $ (1,238 ) The Company has six sales and leaseback transactions. These transactions do not qualify for sales leaseback accounting because of the Companys deemed continuing involvement with the buyer-lessor due to fixed price renewal options, which results in the transaction being recorded under the financing method. Under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds from the transactions are recorded as a financing liability. A portion of lease payments are applied as payments of deemed principal and imputed interest. The deemed landlord financing liability was $3,662 as of December31, 2011. The future minimum lease payments for each of the next five years and thereafter for deemed landlord financing obligations are as follows: 2012 $ 394 2013 394 2014 394 2015 400 2016 421 Thereafter 3,895 Total minimum lease payments 5,898 Less: Interest implicit in lease (2,236 ) Total deemed landlord financing $ 3,662 8. Loss on Equity Method Investment During the twelve months ended December31, 2011, the Company recognized losses of $2,486 on its equity method investment in ANGR Holdings, LLC, which operated the restaurants awarded on the television program Americas Next Great Restaurant prior to their closure. The recognized losses, which represent the entire amount of the Companys investment, are included in interest and other expense in the consolidated statement of income.
53 Table of Contents 9. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) is calculated using income available to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive securities include shares of common stock underlying stock options, SOSARs and non-vested stock awards. Diluted EPS considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. SOSARs to purchase 240, 340 and 532 shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of 2011, 2010 and 2009 diluted EPS, respectively, because they were anti-dilutive. In addition, 224, 60 and 119 stock awards subject to performance conditions were excluded from the 2011, 2010 and 2009 calculations of diluted EPS. The following table sets forth the computations of basic and dilutive earnings per share: Year ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Net income $ 214,945 $ 178,981 $ 126,845 Shares: Weighted average number of common shares outstanding 31,217 31,234 31,766 Dilutive stock options and SOSARs 497 422 247 Dilutive non-vested stock awards 61 79 89 Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 31,775 31,735 32,102 Basic earnings per share $ 6.89 $ 5.73 $ 3.99 Diluted earnings per share $ 6.76 $ 5.64 $ 3.95 10. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations The Company enters into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Those that are binding primarily relate to amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, commitment for food purchases, and corporate sponsorships. As of December31, 2011, total purchase obligations were $73,455.
Litigation In 2006, Maurizio Antoninetti filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, primarily claiming that the height of the serving line wall in the Companys restaurants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, as well as California disability laws. On December6, 2006, Mr.Antoninetti filed an additional lawsuit in the same court making the same allegations on a class action basis, on behalf of himself and a purported class of disabled individuals, and a similar class action was filed by James Perkins in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May7, 2008.
In the individual Antoninetti action, the district court entered a ruling in which it found that although the Companys counter height violated the ADA, the Company provided the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation, and awarded attorneys fees and minimal damages to the plaintiff which the Company has accrued. The Company and the plaintiff appealed the district courts ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on July26, 2010, the appeals court entered a ruling finding that the Company violated the ADA and did not provide the plaintiff with an equivalent facilitation, and remanded the case to the district court. The district court will now determine the damages and injunctive relief and final award of attorneys fees to which Antoninetti is entitled based on the court of appeals ruling.
54 Table of Contents The Company lowered the height of its serving line walls throughout California some time ago, which makes injunctive relief in both the individual and class actions moot, and has the lower serving line walls in a significant majority of its restaurants outside of California as well. The Company will vigorously defend the class action cases, including by contesting certification of a plaintiff class. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of, or any additional potential liability from, these cases.
A lawsuit has been filed against the Company in California alleging violations of state laws regarding employee record-keeping, meal and rest breaks, payment of overtime and related practices with respect to its employees. The case originally sought damages, penalties and attorneys fees on behalf of a purported class of the Companys present and former employees. The court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify the purported class, and as a result the action can proceed, if at all, as an action by a single plaintiff. The plaintiff has appealed the courts denial of class certification, and the appeal remains pending. Although the Company has various defenses, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from this case.
Following an inspection during 2010 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of the work authorization documents of the Companys restaurant employees in Minnesota, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm of DHS (ICE) issued to the Company a Notice of Suspect Documents identifying a large number of employees who, according to ICE and notwithstanding the Companys review of work authorization documents for each employee at the time they were hired, appeared not to be authorized to work in the U.S. The Company approached each of the named employees to explain ICEs determination and afforded each employee an opportunity to confirm the validity of their original work eligibility documents, or provide valid work eligibility documents. Employees who were unable to provide valid work eligibility documents were terminated in accordance with the law. In December 2010, the Company was also requested by DHS to provide the work authorization documents of restaurant employees in the District of Columbia and Virginia, and the Company provided the requested documents in January 2011. The Company has received additional requests for work authorization documents covering a small number of individual restaurants as well, and ICEs investigation remains ongoing. In April 2011 the Company also received notice from the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia that it is conducting an investigation into these matters through its criminal division. The Company believes its practices with regard to the work authorization of its employees, including the review and retention of work authorization documents, are in compliance with applicable law. However, the termination of large numbers of employees in a short period of time does disrupt restaurant operations and results in a temporary increase in labor costs as new employees are trained. It is not possible at this time to determine whether the Company will incur any fines, penalties or further liabilities in connection with these matters.
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to other proceedings, lawsuits and claims. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, the Company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of December31, 2011. These matters could affect the operating results of any one quarter when resolved in future periods. Management does not believe that any monetary liability or financial impact to the Company as a result of these proceedings or claims will be material to the Companys annual consolidated financial statements. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims resulting in greater liabilities than the Company currently anticipates, could materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.

ITEM9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e)promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December31, 2011, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2011 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f)under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting .
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst& Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report follows.
57 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.
We have audited Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each ofthe three years in the period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February10, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
