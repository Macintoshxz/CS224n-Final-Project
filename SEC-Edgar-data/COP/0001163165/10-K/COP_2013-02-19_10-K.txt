Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES CORPORATE STRUCTURE ConocoPhillips is the worlds largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August30, 2002.
On April30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our strategic asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 2Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 30 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio primarily includes legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; growing North American shale and oil sands businesses; several major international developments; and a global exploration program.
At December31, 2012, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 16,900 people worldwide.
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December31, 2012, our continuing operations were producing in 1 Table of Contents the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia.
Our operating segments were realigned upon the separation of Phillips 66, and as a result, all prior periods presented have been restated. We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
The information listed below appears in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:  Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.
Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.
Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.
Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.
Developed and undeveloped acreage.
2 Table of Contents The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 80 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the table below.

Production from continuing operations for 2012 averaged 1,527MBOED, compared with 1,561 MBOED in 2011. Average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent in 2012, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48.
Our worldwide annual average crude oil sales price from continuing operations remained relatively flat in 2012, from $105.52 per barrel in 2011 to $105.72 per barrel in 2012, while worldwide average annual natural gas liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 17 percent, from $55.73 per barrel in 2011 to $46.36 per barrel in 2012. Our average annual worldwide natural gas sales price from continuing operations decreased 6 percent, from $5.80 per thousand cubic feet in 2011 to $5.48 per thousand cubic feet in 2012. Average annual bitumen prices decreased 14 percent, from $62.56 per barrel in 2011 to $53.91 per barrel in 2012.
3 Table of Contents ALASKA The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. In 2012, Alaska operations contributed 24 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production.

(2) Millions of cubic feet per day.
Greater Prudhoe Area The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaskas North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bays satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.
Greater Kuparuk Area We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is made up of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay on Alaskas North Slope. Field installations include three central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. The natural gas is either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection.
Western North Slope On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In October 2012, Alpine West CD5, a satellite field located west of Alpine in the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska (NPRA), was sanctioned. Initial production is anticipated in late 2015, with net peak production estimated at 10MBOED in 2016.
Cook Inlet Area We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Plant, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Our share of production is sold to local utilities and is also used to supply feedstock and fuel to the Kenai LNG Plant.
The Kenai LNG Plant had historically supplied LNG to utility companies in Japan. Although we idled the plant in October 2012, we maintain the capability to operate it and are evaluating options for future use. The LNG export license will expire in March 2013.
4 Table of Contents Point Thomson We own a 5 percent interest in the Point Thomson Field, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by 2016, which is estimated to send 400net BOED of condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).
North Slope Natural Gas In March 2012, we, along with Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation, announced we are working together on a plan aimed at commercializing North Slope natural gas resources through large-scale LNG exports from south-central Alaska. Planning and assessment is ongoing.
Exploration In the February 2008 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Sale 193, we successfully bid and were awarded 10-year-primary-term leases on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea.We plan to drill an exploration well on our Devils Paw prospect in 2014, subject to the outcome of pending litigation challenging Lease Sale 193 and the receipt of required regulatory permits.
Shark Tooth #1, an appraisal step-out well from the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field, was spud in January 2012, and is being evaluated for further development potential. During 2013, we plan to drill one exploration well, Cassin, on the North Slope.
Transportation We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 28.3percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok Pipelines on the North Slope.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering third-party vessels as necessary.
5 Table of Contents LOWER 48 AND LATIN AMERICA Lower 48 The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states. We hold 15.5million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2012, Lower 48 and Latin America contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 37 percent of our natural gas production.

Our unconventional holdings total 2.5million net acres and include approximately 626,000 net acres in the Bakken; 227,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford; 194,000 net acres in Permian; 130,000 net acres in Niobrara; 900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin; and nearly 430,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays. The majority of this acreage is either held by production or owned by the Company.
The majority of our 2012 onshore production originated from the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett, the Lobo Trend, Anadarko Basin and Bossier Trend. We also have operations in the Wind River Basin, East Texas, Rockies and northern and southern Louisiana. Onshore activities in 2012 were centered mostly on continued optimization and development of existing and emerging assets, with particular focus on areas with higher liquids production.
Shale Plays Exploration and development continued in our shale positions in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Barnett. In the Eagle Ford, we drilled 211 exploration and development wells and connected 170 wells in 2012, achieving net peak production of over 100 MBOED in December 2012. In 2013, we plan to drill approximately 140 wells and connect approximately 200 wells. With continued investments, we expect long-term average production from the Eagle Ford will be approximately 140 MBOED by 2016.
San Juan The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 35 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We hold approximately 1.3million acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue 6 Table of Contents conventional development opportunities. This includes approximately 900,000 net acres of lease rights, where we are advancing the assessment of the Mancos shale play.
In January 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of our properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline, comprising approximately 86,000 net acres in southwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.
Gulf of Mexico At year-end 2012, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:  75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.
16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.
16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.
12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.
Exploration  Conventional Exploration In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we held 1.7million acres at December31, 2012. In November 2012, we were the successful high bidder on 62 blocks in OCS Western Lease Sale 229, the majority of which have been awarded to date. We anticipate the remaining blocks will be awarded in the first quarter of 2013, which would increase our Gulf of Mexico position to 2.0million net acres. In 2013, drilling continued on the partner-operated Coronado wildcat well and the Shenandoah appraisal well, both of which were spud in 2012. During the first half of 2013, drilling is expected to commence on the partner-operated Ardennes wildcat well, the Tiber appraisal well and a ConocoPhillips-operated wildcat well in the Miocene/Pliocene Thorn prospect. We also plan to participate in two-to-three additional non-operated wildcat wells in 2013.
In support of our intentions to grow our Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we secured access to an ultra deepwater drillship in 2012, which will provide rig availability for our operated drilling program beginning in 2014.
Unconventional Exploration In 2012, we actively pursued the appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Eagle Ford in South Texas, the Bakken in the Williston Basin, the Barnett in the Fort Worth Basin, the Niobrara play in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, the Avalon and Wolfcamp in the Permian Basin, and the Mancos in the San Juan Basin. During 2012, we acquired approximately 340,000 net additional acres in various resource plays across the Lower 48, which included the Avalon, Wolfcamp, Niobrara, and various exploration plays, further expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays to approximately 2.5million net acres.
During 2012, we drilled a total of 20 unconventional test wells in the Avalon, Wolfcamp, Niobrara, Bakken Little Missouri, Lewis and Mancos plays. Drilling is expected to continue in 2013.
Transportation Our 25 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX) was transferred to Phillips 66 as part of the separation. We retained the capacity rights and obligations to REX.
Facilities Freeport LNG Terminal We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeports 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas.
7 Table of Contents Market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets; therefore, our near- to mid-term utilization of the Freeport Terminal is expected to be limited to LNG storage and reload activities. We are responsible for monthly process-or-pay payments to Freeport irrespective of whether we utilize the terminal for regasification. The financial impact of these capacity underutilization payments is not expected to be material to our future earnings or cash flows.
Golden Pass LNG Terminal We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatargas3 and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets; therefore, our near-to-mid-term utilization of the terminal is expected to be limited.
Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited We own a 39 percent interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, which processes natural gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids in the Caribbean, Central America and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Facilities include a 2-billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and a 70,000 barrel-per-day natural gas liquids fractionator.
Other  San Juan Gas Plant  We operate and own a 50 percent interest in the San Juan Gas Plant, a 550million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing plant in Bloomfield, New Mexico.
Lost Cabin Gas Plant  We operate and own a 46 percent interest in the Lost Cabin Gas Plant, a 313million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing facility in Lysite, Wyoming.
Wingate Fractionator  We operate and own the Wingate Fractionator, a 25,000 barrel-per-day capacity natural gas liquids fractionation plant located in Gallup, New Mexico.
Venezuela In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan governments Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuelas national oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA),or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November2, 2007, with the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we anticipate an interim decision on key legal and factual issues in 2013. In a separate commercial arbitration from the Companys ICSID claim discussed above, an International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) tribunal issued a decision in favor of the Company in September 2012, finding PDVSA owed $67 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements. In November 2012, based on the ICC tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million, including post-judgment interest, which resulted in a $61million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual.
Ecuador In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil.In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. On April24, 2012, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe are not material. The ICSID tribunal issued a decisionon liabilityon December14, 2012, in favor of Burlington, 8 Table of Contents finding that Ecuadors seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration phase will take place to determine thedamagesowed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuadors actions.
Peru Exploration We own a 45percent operating interest in Blocks 123 and 129, covering nearly 1.6million net acres. In October 2012, we announced our decision not to pursue further exploration activities in Blocks 123 and 129. This decision to withdraw is part of our strategic plan to optimize our portfolio of assets.
CANADA Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2012, Canada operations contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production.

We operate or have ownership interests in approximately 80 natural gas processing plants in the region, and, as of December31, 2012, held leasehold rights in 5.9million net acres in western Canada.
Oil Sands We hold approximately 1.1million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.
Surmont The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. Surmont Phase 2 construction began in 2010, with production startup targeted for 2015. Following startup, Surmonts gross production capacity is estimated to be 150 MBOED, with net peak production of 65 MBOED anticipated by 2018.
FCCL We have a 50/50 heavy oil business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc., FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership. FCCLs assets, operated by Cenovus, include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments.
Construction continued in 2012 on both the Foster Creek and Christina Lake properties. At Christina Lake, Phase D was completed and production came on stream in the third quarter of 2012. Phase D 9 Table of Contents added 40 MBOED of gross production capacity, bringing total gross production capacity to 98MBOED. Phase E is expected to be completed in 2013, with first production targeted for the second half of 2013, which will add another 40 MBOED of gross production capacity. Phase F was sanctioned in the fourth quarter of 2012, with production startup anticipated in 2016, which will add an additional 50 MBOED of gross production capacity.
At Foster Creek, construction progressed on Phases F, G and H, which are estimated to be completed in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. These phases will add approximately 125 MBOED of gross production capacity. FCCL anticipates submitting an application for regulatory approval for an additional expansion, Phase J, in 2013.
Narrows Lake is a new oil sands development within the FCCL Partnership. In May 2012, FCCL received approval from the Alberta government to proceed with Narrows Lake. Narrows Lake Phase A was sanctioned in the fourth quarter of 2012, and initial production is anticipated in 2017.
Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project We were involved with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Gas Project, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline and gathering system, which was proposed to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake natural gas field, one of the primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. Due to a continued decline in market conditions and lack of acceptable commercial terms, the project was suspended indefinitely in the first quarter of 2012. As a result, we recorded a $520 million after-tax impairment in 2012 for the carrying value of capitalized development costs and associated undeveloped leasehold costs.

Origin operates APLNGs production and pipeline system, and we will operate the LNG facility. Natural gas is currently sold to domestic customers, while progress continues on the development of an LNG processing and export sales business. Once established, this will enhance our LNG position and serve as an additional LNG hub supplying Asia Pacific markets. Two initial 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been sanctioned, with approximately 9,000 net wells ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG development. The additional wells will be supported by expanded gas gathering systems, centralized gas processing and compression stations, and water treatment facilities, in addition to a new export pipeline from the gas fields to the LNG facilities.
During 2011, three significant milestones were achieved. First, the development received environmental approval from the Australian federal government. Second, definitive agreements were signed with Sinopec for the supply of up to 4.3million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest diluting from 50 percent to 42.5percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011. Third, a binding Heads of Agreement was signed with Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc., for the sale of approximately 1million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years.
13 Table of Contents In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for the sale and purchase of an additional 3.3million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035. This agreement, in combination with the Kansai Electric agreement, finalized the marketing of the second train. In July 2012, we sanctioned the development of the second 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG production train. Start-up of the second train is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015, with resulting LNG exports commencing shortly thereafter sold under the binding sales agreements to Sinopec and Kansai Electric. Upon sanctioning of the second train in July and in conjunction with the LNG sales agreement, Sinopec subscribed to additional shares in APLNG, which increased its equity interest from 15percent to 25 percent. As a result, on July12, 2012, both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest diluted from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent.
APLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2012 and began drawing on the financing in October 2012. Our reduced ownership interest, coupled with Sinopecs $2.1 billion injection into APLNG associated with the dilution and APLNGs successful placement of the $8.5 billion of project financing, will lower our future capital requirements to fund the project. We are evaluating opportunities to further reduce our ownership interest in APLNG. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility, which will be released upon meeting certain completion milestones.

22 Table of Contents Item1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.
Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.
Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows and may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce economically.
Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.
The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations.
Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.
Our proved reserve information included in this annual report has been derived from engineering estimates prepared or reviewed by our personnel. Any significant future price changes could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported.
We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.
Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:  The discharge of pollutants into the environment.
Emissions into the atmosphere (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions as they are, or may become, regulated).
The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
23 Table of Contents  The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.
Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and shale gas plays.
We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
Although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earths climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall.
In addition, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, the United States, as well as other countries where we do business, may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on our operations; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries. The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future.
Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 56 percent of our hydrocarbon production from continuing operations was derived from production outside the United States in 2012, and 57 percent of our proved reserves, as of December31, 2012, was located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, natural gas or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations.
Changes in governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, and natural gas liquids.
Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, natural gas, bitumen and natural gas liquids wells below actual production capacity. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.
24 Table of Contents Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture participants. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
We do not insure against all potential losses; therefore, we could be harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.
We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. As such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.
The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, pipeline interruptions, pipeline ruptures, crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, or cyber attacks. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation.
Our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cybersecurity breaches. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations disrupted.
25 Table of Contents Item1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
Item3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as matters previously reported in our 2011 Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2012 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2012. Material developments to the previously reported matters have been included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings was decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to SEC regulations.
New Matters The New Mexico Environment Department has issued four Notices of Violation (NOVs) to ConocoPhillips alleging a total of twenty individual violations for failure to comply with air emission recordkeeping, reporting and testing requirements at various natural gas compression operations in northwestern New Mexico. These violations are alleged to have occurred between 2006 and 2012. The agency is seeking a penalty of over $100,000. We have submitted responses to all four of the NOVs and will work with the agency to resolve these matters.
Matters Previously Reported  ConocoPhillips The North Dakota Department of Health has requested all the operators in the Bakken Pool area, including ConocoPhillips, enter into an Administrative Consent Agreement to resolve alleged historic violations of the states air emission regulations. The state is proposing a penalty of $2,000 per well drilled in the Bakken Pool which would result in total penalty to the company of over $100,000. ConocoPhillips is working with the state to resolve this matter.
Matters Previously Reported  Phillips 66 On April30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. In connection with the separation, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement, which provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters, such as legal proceedings. We have included matters where we remain a party to a proceeding relating to Phillips 66, in accordance with SEC regulations. We do not expect any of those matters to result in a net claim against us.
On September19, 2012, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (District) issued a $213,500 demand to settle fourteen NOVs issued in 2009 and 2010 with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.Phillips 66 is working with the District to resolve this matter.
On October15, 2012, the District issued a $313,000 demand to settle thirteen NOVs issued in 2010 and 2011 with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery. Phillips 66 is working with the District to resolve this matter.
On March7, 2012, the District issued a $302,500 demand to settle five NOVs issued between 2008 and 2010 to the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery. The NOVs allege non-compliance with the District rules and/or facility permit conditions. Phillips 66 is working with the District to resolve this matter.
In May 2012, the Illinois Attorney Generals office filed and served a Complaint against ConocoPhillips with respect to operations at the Phillips 66 Wood River Refinery alleging violations of the Illinois groundwater standards and a third-partys hazardous waste permit. The Complaint seeks as relief remediation of area 26 Table of Contents groundwater, compliance with the hazardous waste permit, enhanced pipeline and tank integrity measures, additional spill reporting, and yet-to-be specified amounts for fines and penalties. Phillips 66 is working with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and Attorney Generals office to resolve these allegations.
In December 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of alleged violations related to the use of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). Phillips 66 was one of several companies who entered Administrative Settlement Agreements (ASAs) with the EPA to settle allegations it had used invalid RINs for its 2010 and 2011 fuel program compliance.Under this Agreement, Phillips 66 will pay a maximum of $350,000 in penalties for the use of invalid RINs.Payments are made upon demand from the EPA.To date, $250,000 has been paid and it is anticipated the EPA will demand the final $100,000 in 2013.
On November28, 2011, the Phillips 66 Borger Refinery received a Notice of Enforcement from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for alleged emissions events that occurred during inclement weather in January and February 2011. The TCEQ is seeking a penalty of $120,000. Phillips 66 is working with TCEQ to resolve this matter.
In October 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the Attorney General of the State of California it was conducting an investigation into possible violations of the regulations relating to the operation of underground storage tanks at gas stations in California. On January3, 2013, we were served with a lawsuit filed by the California Attorney General that alleges such violations. Philips 66 is contesting these allegations.
In October 2007, we received a Complaint from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water Act related to a 2006 oil spill at the Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000. Phillips 66 is working with the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to resolve this matter.
On May19, 2010, the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Louisiana Refinery received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) alleging various violations of applicable air emission regulations, as well as certain provisions of the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-01-4430. Phillips 66 is working with the LDEQ to resolve this matter.

Due to the separation of the downstream businesses and our intention to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses in 2012, which are reported as discontinued operations, income (loss) from continuing operations is more representative of ConocoPhillips as an independent exploration and production company. The terms earnings and loss as used in Managements Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) from continuing operations.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the worlds largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 30 countries. At December31, 2012, we had approximately 16,900employees worldwide and total assets of $117 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP.
Discontinued Operations On April30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our strategic asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in Kashagan and our Nigerian and Algerian businesses. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 2Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Overview As an independent E&P company, we are solely focused on our core business of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our portfolio primarily includes legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; growing North American shale and oil sands businesses; several major international developments; and a global exploration program. Our value proposition to our shareholders is to deliver 32 Table of Contents production and cash margin growth, competitive returns on capital, and a compelling dividend, while keeping our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. We expect to achieve our value proposition through portfolio optimization, investments in high-margin developments, applying technical capability and maintaining financial flexibility.
In our first year as an independent E&P company, we achieved production of 1.58million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), including production from discontinued operations of .05million BOED; advanced our growth and drilling programs; paid dividends on our common stock of $3.3 billion for the full year; and repurchased 80million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $5.1 billion. In 2012, we also announced plans to raise $8$10 billion of proceeds from asset dispositions by the end of 2013. As part of this program, we have generated $2.1 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions through December31, 2012. We have also announced asset sales, expected to close by mid-2013, which will generate approximately $9.6billion in additional proceeds. In the near-term, we will fund a portion of our capital program with these proceeds. Over the next five years, our investment in high-margin developments should position us to deliver 35 percent annual production volume and margin growth, enabling us to fund our capital program organically.
Our total capital program is expected to be $15.8 billion in 2013, compared to $15.7 billion in 2012. Excluding Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria, which are reported as discontinued operations, our 2013 capital program is expected to be $15.5 billion, compared to $14.9 billion in 2012. Our investments will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia, as well as exploration opportunities which will build our inventory for the future.
Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2012 included the following:  Completed the separation of our Downstream business on April30, 2012, creating two independent energy companies, ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66.
Achieved annual production of 1.58million BOED, including production from discontinued operations of .05million BOED, and generated earnings of $7.5 billion.
Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 156 percent and year-end proved reserves of 8.6billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Repurchased 80million ConocoPhillips shares, representing 6 percent of our outstanding shares.
Paid quarterly dividends of 66 cents per share, consistent with pre-separation dividends.
Exceeded 100,000 BOED production milestone in the Eagle Ford; continued Bakken activity ramp up.
Exceeded 100,000 BOED average production in the Canadian Oil sands in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Progressed FCCL expansion with sanction of Christina Lake Phase F and Narrows Lake Phase A.
Achieved first oil from the Gumusut Field in Malaysia.
Increased deepwater Gulf of Mexico position to 1.7million acres; continued appraisal drilling. Expect to increase acreage position to 2.0million acres in the first quarter of 2013.
Increased Niobrara acreage position to approximately 130,000 acres; continued drilling and testing of unconventional shale plays.
Progressed the Australia Pacific LNG Project with sanction of the second train in early July 2012; secured $8.5 billion project finance facility.
Advanced the disposition program with the announcement of agreements to sell Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria, generating approximately $8.5 billion in expected proceeds.
Business Environment In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced many challenges which have influenced our operations and profitability, largely due to factors beyond our control, such as the recent financial crisis, geopolitical events or fears thereof, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies, and weather-related disruptions. These factors generally influence the supply and demand of crude oil and natural gas. The most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of our 33 Table of Contents operating cash flows into our business is commodity prices. The prices for commodity products are supply- and demand-based and can be very volatile; therefore, to navigate through the volatility, our strategy is to maintain a core portfolio of low-risk, high-return development programs associated with legacy assets, coupled with a portfolio of development opportunities which offer high-margin growth, such as unconventional plays, deepwater and arctic drilling, and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Operating and Financial Priorities Important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include:  Operating safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.
Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth.
There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom.
Adding to our proved reserve base.
We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.
o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
o Acquisition of existing fields.
Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December31, 2012, our organic reserve replacement was 108percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases.
Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
Disciplined investment approach.
We participate in a capital-intensive industry. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or construct pipelines and LNG facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on higher-margin liquids plays and limited investment in North American conventional natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we expect a corresponding shift in our production mix. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns.
34 Table of Contents Our $15.8 billion capital program includes contributions to FCCL of $0.8 billion. Our capital expenditures and investment budget for 2013, excluding FCCL, is $15.0 billion, compared to actual capital expenditures and investments in 2012 of $15.0 billion. Excluding discontinued operations for Kashagan, Nigeria and Algeria, we estimate 2013 capital expenditures and investments will be $14.7billion, compared to $14.2 billion in 2012. Approximately 10 percent of the 2013 capital budget is expected to be directed toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio; 40 percent is expected to be allocated to exploitation programs in our legacy asset base, which is intended to offset natural decline from these assets; 35 percent is expected to be spent on sanctioned major developments, such as Eldfisk II, Jasmine and APLNG; and 15 percent is planned for our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target both conventional and unconventional plays.
Portfolio optimization.
We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic holdings. In 2012, we announced plans to sell an additional $8$10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. During 2012, we sold our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and we further diluted our interest in APLNG from 42.5percent to 37.5 percent. We recently announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan, our Algerian and Nigerian businesses, and certain properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in North Dakota and Montana. Cedar Creek Anticline is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, and the remaining transactions are expected to close by mid-2013, subject to customary governmental approvals. Additionally, in January 2013, we sold our 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan.
In 2011, we sold certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada, and we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL.
Controlling costs and expenses.
Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industry, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 8 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily as a result of major turnaround expenses in Australia, higher operating expenses in the Lower 48 associated with improved production as a result of increased drilling programs, the settlement of environmental claims and other costs related to Bohai Bay, China, and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66.
Developing and retaining a talented work force.
We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills.
35 Table of Contents Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:  Commodity prices.
Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following table depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Dollars Per Unit 2012 2011 2010 Market Indicators WTI (per barrel) $ 94.16 95.05 79.39 Dated Brent (per barrel) 111.58 111.27 79.47 U.S. Henry Hub first of month (per million British thermal units) 2.79 4.04 4.39 Global oil prices remained relatively flat in 2012, compared to 2011. In 2012, global oil demand grew at approximately the same pace as in 2011, at about 0.9 percent or 800thousand barrels per day, as the pace of economic expansion moderated due to intentional slowing in China, coupled with fiscal uncertainties in the European Union and the United States. Global oil production rose due to an increase in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and North American production. WTI continued to trade at a discount to Brent throughout 2011 and 2012, mainly due to high inventory levels and excess crude supply in the U.S. Midcontinent market, largely as a result of limited pipeline capacity.
Henry Hub natural gas prices decreased 31 percent in 2012, compared with 2011. U.S. natural gas prices were depressed in 2012, mainly due to high inventory levels, a warmer-than-normal winter and sustained production from shale plays. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices in the near- to mid-term. The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. As a result, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 30 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. Our realized bitumen price declined 14 percent in 2012. We expect bitumen prices to remain weak in the near-term, until additional heavy refining capacity comes on-line.
In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; continued delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible.
Impairments.
As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2012 totaled $1.2 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in Canada; Cedar Creek Anticline in the Lower 48; various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives; and the N Block in the Caspian Sea. Before-tax impairments in 2011 totaled $0.8 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of our equity 36 Table of Contents investment in NMNG and certain Canadian natural gas properties. For additional information, see Note 9Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective tax rate.
Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations.
Fiscal and regulatory environment.
Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libyas period of civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries.
Outlook Total production for the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be 1.58million to 1.6million BOED, including production from discontinued operations of approximately 40,000 BOED. Full-year 2013 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1.475million to 1.525million BOED,which is consistent with 2012 production from continuing operations adjusted for dispositions.
Segment Analysis We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
The LUKOIL Investment segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation of Phillips 66 and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received.
Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production.

The increase was mainly due to:  Higher gains from asset sales. In 2012, gains from asset dispositions were $1,567 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2011 from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales of $141 million after-tax.
Higher LNG and crude oil prices.
Lower production taxes, mainly as a result of lower volumes.
The benefit from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million.
The favorable resolution of pending claims and settlements of $235 million after-tax.
These items were partially offset by:  Lower volumes, largely due to dispositions and reduced production in China.
Lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen prices.
Higher operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included pension settlement expenses of $87 million after-tax and separation costs of $84 million after-tax.
Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2012 totaled $900 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2011 of $698 million after-tax.
2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for ConocoPhillips decreased 30 percent in 2011. The decrease was mainly due to:  Lower gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales were $141 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2010 of $4,463 million after-tax.
The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest.
Lower production volumes.
38 Table of Contents These items were partially offset by:  Higher commodity prices. Commodity price benefits were partly offset by increased production taxes.
Lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly as a result of lower volumes.
Income Statement Analysis 2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 10 percent in 2012, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partly offset by higher LNG prices.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 54 percent in 2012. The increase primarily resulted from:  Improved earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3)(QG3), mainly due to higher LNG prices, partly offset by lower volumes.
Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment.
Gain on dispositions increased $1,287 million in 2012. Gains in 2012 primarily resulted from the disposition of our Vietnam business, our equity investment in NMNG, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea and our interest in Block 39 in Peru, partly offset by the loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Gains in 2011 mainly consisted of the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares and the disposition of certain properties located in the Lower 48 and Canada, partially offset by the loss on the initial dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. For additional information, see Note5Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other income increased 78 percent in 2012, mostly as a result of the favorable resolution of the Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. For additional information, see Note 14Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Purchased commodities decreased 15 percent in 2012, largely as a result of lower U.S. natural gas prices, partly offset by higher purchased volumes.
Production and operating expenses increased 6 percent in 2012, mostly due to major turnaround expenses at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility and higher operating expenses in the Lower 48.
SG&A expenses increased 28 percent in 2012, primarily due to pension settlement expense and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66.
Exploration expenses increased 45 percent in 2012, mostly due to the impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project as a result of its indefinite suspension in the first quarter of 2012.
Impairments increased 112 percent in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included the $213 million impairment of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project in the first quarter of 2012, the $192million property impairment related to the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, as well as increases in the asset retirement obligation for various properties mostly located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives. Impairments in 2011 consisted of various North American natural gas properties. For additional information, see Note 9Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
39 Table of Contents Taxes other than income taxes decreased 11 percent in 2012, mostly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes.
Interest and debt expense decreased 26 percent in 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest on projects and lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels.
See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.
2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 14 percent in 2011, mainly due to significantly higher prices for crude oil and higher LNG prices and volumes. Lower crude oil and natural gas volumes partly offset this increase.
Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 10 percent in 2011. The decrease primarily resulted from the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest. This decrease was partially offset by:  Earnings from QG3, primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October 2010.
Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a $645 million impairment.
Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes.
Gain on dispositions decreased 93 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, as well as the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50percent to 42.5 percent. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of a portion of our LUKOIL shares, and gains on the disposition of certain assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada.
Purchased commodities increased 20 percent in 2011, mainly due to higher natural gas prices in Europe.
DD&A decreased 15 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011.
Impairments increased $240 million in 2011, mostly due to the impairment of various North American natural gas properties in 2011.
Taxes other than income taxes increased 43percent in 2011, mostly due to higher production taxes in Alaska as a result of higher crude oil prices.
Interest and debt expense decreased 18percent in 2011, primarily due to lower average debt levels.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December31, 2012, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia.
In 2012, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2011, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48.
In 2011, average production decreased 8 percent compared with 2010, mostly as a result of suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and higher unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production.

In 2012, Alaska contributed 24 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1percent of our natural gas production.
2012 vs. 2011 Our Alaska operations reported earnings of $2,276 million in 2012, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,984 million in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices, lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes, the absence of the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011, and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating expenses.
Production averaged 213 MBOED in 2012, a decrease of 5 percent compared with 2011. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower unplanned downtime.
2011 vs. 2010 Alaska earnings were $1,984 million in 2011, a 15 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,727 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 benefitted from significantly higher crude oil prices, partially offset by higher production taxes, lower volumes, higher operating expenses, and the $54million after-tax write-off of the Denali gas pipeline project.
Production averaged 225 MBOED in 2011, a decrease of 8 percent compared with 2010. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, somewhat offset by increased drilling activity.

The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states.
2012 vs. 2011 Lower 48 and Latin America operations reported earnings of $1,029 million in 2012, a 20percent decrease compared with 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of substantially lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production; lower gains from asset dispositions; higher operating expenses and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes. Earnings in 2012 also benefitted from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million, and the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration.
In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which has been reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. For additional information, see Note 14Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24 percent over the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline. In addition, higher unplanned downtime during 2012 partly offset the increase in production.
2011 vs. 2010 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings were $1,288 million in 2011, a 25percent increase compared with 2010. The increase in 2011 earnings was mainly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower gains from asset sales, lower natural gas prices, higher dry hole expenses and impairments.
Production averaged 428 MBOED in 2011, a 3 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease in 2011 was mainly due to asset dispositions. Normal field decline was offset by new production, mainly from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian and Barnett areas, and improved drilling and well performance.

In 2012, Canada contributed 15 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 21 percent of our natural gas production.
2012 vs. 2011 Canada operations reported a loss of $684 million in 2012, a reduction of $775 million compared with earnings of $91 million in 2011. The decrease in earnings was largely due to significantly lower natural gas prices, lower bitumen prices and higher impairments, mainly as a result of the $520 million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in 2012.These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher bitumen volumes from FCCL and lower DD&A from our western Canadian gas assets, primarily due to asset dispositions and curtailments.Equity earnings from FCCL were also impacted by higher operating and DD&A expenses, mostly as a result of higher production volumes.
Average production in Canada increased 5 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24percent over the same period. Normal field decline and the impact from asset dispositions were more than offset by new production from Christina Lake Phases C and D and improved well performance from Foster Creek, both in FCCL.
2011 vs. 2010 Canada earnings were $91 million in 2011, a reduction of $2,811 million compared with 2010. This decrease was primarily due to lower gains from asset dispositions. Earnings in 2010 included the $2,679 million after-tax gain realized from the sale of our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil sands mining operation. Lower volumes, mostly as a result of asset dispositions, impairments on various natural gas properties and lower 44 Table of Contents natural gas prices also contributed to the decrease in 2011 earnings. These decreases were somewhat offset by higher bitumen, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices, lower DD&A and lower dry hole expenses.
Production averaged 260 MBOED in 2011, a 5 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease was mainly due to asset dispositions and normal field decline, partly offset by new production from FCCL.

In 2012, our Europe operations contributed 17percent of our worldwide liquids production and 13 percent of our natural gas production.
2012 vs. 2011 Europe operations reported earnings of $1,498 million in 2012, an 18 percent decrease compared with 2011. The reduction in earnings was mainly due to lower volumes and higher impairments. Earnings for 2012 were also impacted by additional income tax expense due to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in 2012, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances. These decreases to earnings were partly offset by a $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields and lower DD&A. Additionally, earnings in 2011 included a $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense due to legislation enacted in 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March24, 2011, through December31, 2011.
Production averaged 228 MBOED in 2012, an 18 percent decrease compared with 2011. The decrease was mostly due to normal field decline, dispositions and higher unplanned downtime in the United Kingdom.
2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for our Europe operations were $1,830 million in 2011, a 7 percent increase compared with earnings of $1,703 million in 2010. Earnings benefitted from significantly higher prices and lower DD&A, partly offset by lower volumes and the $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense. Earnings in 2010 also benefitted from a $58 million insurance settlement.
45 Table of Contents Production averaged 279 MBOED in 2011, a 20 percent decrease compared with 2010. The decrease mainly resulted from normal field decline, unplanned downtime and dispositions, somewhat offset by new production from Britannia and J-Block.

During 2012, Asia Pacific and Middle East contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 28 percent of our natural gas production.
2012 vs. 2011 Asia Pacific and Middle East operations reported earnings of $3,996 million in 2012, a 29percent increase compared with 2011 earnings of $3,093 million. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from higher gains from asset dispositions, significantly higher LNG prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A and operating expenses from QG3, and lower Bohai Bay expenses incurred in 2012. Amounts realized from dispositions in 46 Table of Contents 2012 consisted of a $931 million after-tax gain on sale of our Vietnam business and a $133 million after-tax loss recognized on the further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. In 2011, we recognized a $279 million after-tax loss on the initial dilution of our interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. The increase in 2012 earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil volumes, mainly as a result of the Bohai Bay seepage incidents and the Vietnam disposition, lower LNG volumes and higher production taxes.
Average production decreased 10 percent in 2012. The decrease was largely due to the disposition of our Vietnam business, normal field decline, planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility in 2012, as well as lower production in China.
2011 vs. 2010 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased 44percent in 2011, compared with 2010 earnings. The increase was mainly due to higher prices, higher volumes, mostly as a result of a full year of LNG sales from QG3, and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partly offset by higher production taxes, higher operating expenses and the $279million loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent.
Production averaged 332 MBOED in 2011, a 14 percent increase compared with 2010. The increase was largely due to the ramp-up of production from QG3, partly offset by higher unplanned downtime, mainly in China, and normal field decline.
Timor-Leste Arbitration ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax assessments. Between 2010 and 2012, ConocoPhillips has paid, under protest, tax assessments totaling approximately $227 million, which are primarily recorded in the Investments and long-term receivables line on our December31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The arbitration will be conducted in Singapore under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste Government. The arbitration process is currently underway. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.

The Other International segment includes producing operations in Libya and Russia, as well as exploration activities in Angola and the Caspian Sea. During 2012, Other International contributed 6percent of our worldwide liquids production.
2012 vs. 2011 Other International operations reported earnings of $359 million in 2012, a $736 million increase compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in NMNG, the absence of a $395 million after-tax impairment of our investment in NMNG in 2011, and higher earnings from Libya, as a result of the resumption of production following a period of civil unrest in 2011. These increases were partially offset by a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea.
Production averaged 56 MBOED in 2012, a 51 percent increase compared with 2011 production. The increase was mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by field decline in Russia and the disposition of our interest in NMNG.
2011 vs. 2010 Other International reported a loss of $377 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $417 million in 2010. The improvement in 2011 was primarily the result of higher crude oil prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A from NMNG and lower impairments. In 2011, we recorded a $395 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG, compared with a $645 million impairment to NMNG recorded in 2010. These improvements in 2011 were partly offset by considerably lower volumes, mainly from Libya and Russia, as well as the absence of a deferred tax benefit recognized in 2010.
Production averaged 37 MBOED in 2011, a 63 percent decrease compared with 2010 production. The decrease was mostly due to suspended operations in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and field decline in Russia.
48 Table of Contents Asset Dispositions We recently announced our intention to sell our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan and our Algerian and Nigerian businesses. The transactions are expected to close by mid-2013, subject to customary governmental approvals. In January 2013, we sold our 24.5 percent interest in the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan.
LUKOIL Investment Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Income from Continuing Operations $ - 239 2,513 This segment represents our former investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We sold our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
2011 vs. 2010 Earnings in 2011 primarily represented the realized gain on remaining share sales. Earnings in 2010 primarily reflected earnings from the equity investment in LUKOIL we held at the time, in addition to gains on the partial sale of our LUKOIL investment.
Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net interest $ (648 ) (710 ) (995) Corporate general and administrative expenses (313 ) (190 ) (209) Technology (4 ) 15 (23) Separation costs (84 ) (25 ) - Other 56 (50 ) (78) $ (993 ) (960 ) (1,305) 2012 vs. 2011 Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2012, mostly due to higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels, higher interest income and the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the favorable resolution of the PDVSA arbitration. These improvements were partly offset by a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement.
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 65 percent in 2012, mainly due to $87 million of after-tax pension settlement expense and higher costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands; unconventional reservoirs; subsurface technology; liquefied natural gas; and arctic, deepwater and sustainability technology. Technology reported a loss of $4million in 2012, compared to earnings of $15 million in 2011, primarily as a result of lower licensing revenues.
49 Table of Contents Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Separation costs increased $59 million in 2012 and mainly included costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The improvement in Other in 2012 was largely due to various tax-related adjustments, including a $39million after-tax settlement. These improvements were partially offset by higher environmental expenses and foreign currency transaction losses.
2011 vs. 2010 Net interest decreased 29 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, as a result of lower average debt levels. In addition, the absence of a $114million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and the absence of $24 million of after-tax interest expense associated with a tax settlement, both of which occurred in 2010, contributed to the decrease.
Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent in 2011, mainly due to lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans, partly offset by higher advertising expenses.
Technology had earnings of $15million in 2011, as a result of higher licensing revenues, partially offset by higher project expenses.
Separation costs in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs.
Changes in the Other category primarily resulted from lower environmental costs and gains from foreign currency transactions, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment.

** Includes effect of interest rate swaps.
To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2012, we received $2,132 million in proceeds from asset sales and $1,996 million for the issuance of debt. During 2012, the primary uses of our available cash were $14,172million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $5,098million to repurchase common stock; $3,278 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $2,565million to repay debt. During 2012, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,162million to $3,618 million.
In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL.
Separation of Phillips 66 On April30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, were transferred to Phillips 66. After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April16, 2012 (the Record Date), received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date.
In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution. These funds will be used solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution. At December31, 2012, the unused amount of the special cash distribution was $748 million and is designated as Restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet.
Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2012, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $13,458 million, a 4 percent decrease from 2011. During 2011, cash provided by continuing operations was $13,953 million compared with $14,013million in 2010.
51 Table of Contents While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
The level of our production volumes also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
Our 2012 production from continuing operations averaged 1.527million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production from continuing operations in 2013 is expected to be 1.475million to 1.525million BOED.
To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2012 was 142 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 156 percent of 2012 production. Over the five-year period ended December31, 2012, our reserve replacement was 48percent (including 65 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 108 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report.
We are pursuing developments we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make development uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2012 were $2,132 million, primarily from the sale of our Vietnam business, the sale of our equity interest in NMNG and the sale of our interest in the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea. This compares with proceeds of $2,192million in 2011, which mainly included the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL and certain properties located in the Lower 48. We have announced additional asset sales of $9.6billion which are expected to close by mid-2013. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio.
Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In May 2012, we decreased our total revolving credit facilities from $8.0 billion to $7.5 billion by terminating all commitments under the $500 million credit facility, which was due to expire in July 2012. At 52 Table of Contents December31, 2012, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At December31, 2012 and 2011, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, with no letters of credit issued at December31, 2012, and $40 million at December31, 2011. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paperprogram, $1,055million of commercial paper was outstanding at December31, 2012, compared with $1,128million at December31, 2011. Since we had $1,055million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.4billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December31, 2012.
Our senior long-term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility.
Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral. Cash is the primary source for providing collateral; however, many permit us to post letters of credit. At December31, 2012, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $852 million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
53 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.
For information about guarantees, see Note 13Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section.
Our debt balance at December31, 2012, was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $0.9billion during 2012. During 2012, we repaid notes totaling $2.4 billion. We incurred a before-tax loss on redemption of $79 million, consisting of make-whole premiums and unamortized issuance costs. In December 2012, we issued $2.0billion of new low-interest notes.
We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to FCCL. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007 and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $772 million was short-term and was included in the Accounts payablerelated parties line on our December31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $733 million in 2012, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
In February, 2013, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March1, 2013, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February19, 2013.
Since our share repurchase programs began in 2010, share repurchases totaled 300million shares at a cost of $20.1 billion through December31, 2012. Although we have no current plans for further share repurchases, we may do so opportunistically, contingent upon commodity prices and proceeds from asset dispositions.

The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts related to our commodity business. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $12,602 million.
Purchase obligations of $9,629 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.
(c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a five-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus.
(d) Represents contributions to qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years 2013 through 2017. For additional information related to expected benefit payments subsequent to 2017, see Note 19Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $756 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section.
Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
57 Table of Contents Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note 14Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:  U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.
U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).
U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.
U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.
U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.
58 Table of Contents These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.
An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December31, 2011, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 74 sites around the United States. At December31, 2012, we had closed 2 sites and transferred 61 sites to Phillips 66, bringing the number to 11 unresolved sites with potential liability.
For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state 59 Table of Contents agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
Expensed environmental costs were $575million in 2012 and are expected to be about $478million per year in 2013 and 2014. Capitalized environmental costs were $297 million in 2012 and are expected to be about $459 million per year in 2013 and 2014.
Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.
Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
At December31, 2012, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $364million, and we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. At December31, 2011, accrued environmental costs were $922million, of which $542 million related to the Downstream business.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:  European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2012 was approximately $10 million (pre-tax equity share).
A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2012 was approximately $7 million.
60 Table of Contents  The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act.
The EPAs announcement on March29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPAs and U.S. Department of Transportations joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.
Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2012 was approximately $20 million (equity share pre-tax). In October 2012 the Norwegian government announced a doubling of the carbon tax for oil and gas production in 2013. Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which took effect from July 2012. Our annual cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation during the initial fixed price phase is approximately $10 million (equity share pre-tax).
In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:  Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted.
The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).
The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
The GHG reductions required.
The price and availability of offsets.
The amount and allocation of allowances.
Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
61 Table of Contents The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas:  Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions.
Reducing GHG emissionsIn 2011 the Company reduced GHG emissions by 600,000 tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units.
Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies.
Engaging externallyThe Company is a sponsor of MITs Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $8 to $46 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities.
Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income.
62 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.
Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2012, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,915 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $517 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 46percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately fouryears. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2013 would increase by approximately $30million. At year-end 2012, the remaining $6,576million of gross capitalized unproved property costs consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. These major assets are not expected to move to proved properties in 2013.
Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.
63 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment.
At year-end 2012, total suspended well costs were $1,038million, compared with $1,037million at year-end 2011. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 7Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income 64 Table of Contents statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costsforthat asset. At year-end 2012, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment(PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $55billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2012 was approximately $6.4billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011 and 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2012. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2012 would have increased by an estimated $336million.
Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 9Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
Investments innonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity methodare reviewed for impairment whenthere is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions.Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair valueless than the investments carrying amount.Whenit is determined such aloss in valueisother than temporary, an impairment charge is recognizedfor the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value.When determiningwhether a decline in value is other than temporary,managementconsiders factorssuch as thelength of time and extent of the decline, the investees financialcondition and near-term prospects,and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in themarket value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affectthe timing and the amount of animpairment of an investmentin any period.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other 65 Table of Contents compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130million, while a 1percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components ofannual pension expense and triggeraccelerated recognitionof a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.Thesebenefit payments are based ondecisions by plan participants and aretherefore difficult topredict.

Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including the following:  Fluctuations in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids prices.
Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance.
Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.
Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating exploration and production facilities.
Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, bitumen and LNG.
Inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and/or development, construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities; comply with government regulations; or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance.
Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to timely complete construction of, announced and future exploration and production and LNG development.
Potential disruption or interruption of our operations due to accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, terrorism or cyber attacks.
International monetary conditions and exchange controls.
Substantial investment or reduced demand for products as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations.
Liability for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations, under environmental regulations.
Liability resulting from litigation.
General domestic and international economic and political developments, including armed hostilities; expropriation of assets; changes in governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG or natural gas liquids pricing, regulation or taxation; other political, economic or diplomatic developments; and international monetary fluctuations.
Changes in tax and other laws, regulations (including alternative energy mandates), or royalty rules applicable to our business.
Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets.
Delays in, or our inability to implement, our asset disposition plan.
Inability to obtain economical financing for development, construction or modification of facilities and general corporate purposes.
The operation and financing of our joint ventures.

67 Table of Contents Item7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.
Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.
Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:  Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.
Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities.
We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December31, 2012, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December31, 2012 and 2011, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December31, 2012 and 2011, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.
Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at year-end 2012 and 2011 effective yield rates of 0.7percent and 1.24percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10percent change in the December31, 2012, or 2011, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December31, 2012 and 2011, were as follows: 69 Table of Contents In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* FairMarketValue** 2012 2011 2012 2011 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD - 219 $ - (8) Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 2,573 790 31 - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD - 648 - - Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian krone USD - 292 - (7) Buy U.S. dollar, sell euro USD 7 - - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Norwegian krone USD 90 - - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD 43 - (2 ) - Buy euro, sell Norwegian krone EUR - 3 - - Buy euro, sell British pound EUR 96 - - - Sell euro, buy British pound EUR - 64 - 5 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR).

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The companys financial statements have been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst& Young LLP all of the companys financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders and directors meetings.
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the companys management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on our assessment, we believe the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2012.
Ernst& Young LLP has issued an audit report on the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, and their report is included herein.
/s/ Ryan M. Lance /s/ Jeff W. Sheets Ryan M. Lance Jeff W. Sheets Chairman and Executive Vice President, Finance Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer February19, 2013 72 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConocoPhillips We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item8 and financial statement schedule listed in Item15(a). These financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ConocoPhillips internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February19, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst& Young LLP Houston, Texas February19, 2013 73 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConocoPhillips We have audited ConocoPhillips internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2012 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report dated February19, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

79 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ConocoPhillips Note 1  Accounting Policies n Consolidation Principles and Investments  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates operating and financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is either classified as available-for-sale if fair value is readily determinable, or the cost method is used if fair value is not readily determinable. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.
As a result of our separation of Phillips 66 on April30, 2012, the results of operations for our former refining, marketing and transportation businesses; most of our former Midstream segment; our former Chemicals segment; and our power generation and certain technology operations included in our former Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business), have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, the results of operations for our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Algerian and Nigerian businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 2Discontinued Operations, for additional information. We have also realigned our reporting segments following the separation of Phillips 66 and have reflected those changes for all periods presented. We manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. For additional information, see Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing operations.
n Foreign Currency Translation  Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in common stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.
n Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
n Revenue Recognition  Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer, which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry.
Revenues associated with producing properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.
Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).
80 Table of Contents n Shipping and Handling Costs  We include shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased commodities. Freight costs billed to customers were recorded as a component of revenue.
n Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
n Short-Term Investments Investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) with original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year are classified as short-term investments. See Note 15Derivative and Financial Instruments, for additional information on these held-to-maturity financial instruments.
n Inventories  We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory. Commodity-related inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, consistent with industry practice.
n Fair Value Measurements  We categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.
n Derivative Instruments  Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity are recognized in other comprehensive income and appear on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will be recognized immediately in earnings.
81 Table of Contents n Oil and Gas Exploration and Development  Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
Property Acquisition Costs  Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment (PP&E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and managements judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
Exploratory Costs  Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 7Suspended Wells, for additional information on suspended wells.
Development Costs  Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.
Depletion and Amortization  Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.
n Capitalized Interest  Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.
n Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill  Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over their useful lives. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful lives. These indefinite lived intangibles are considered impaired if the fair value of the intangible asset is lower than net book value. The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value of intangible assets is determined based upon the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or upon estimated replacement cost, if expected future cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.
82 Table of Contents n Goodwill  Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book value of the reporting units assets (including goodwill), less liabilities, then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed on the reporting units assets and liabilities using the fair value of the reporting unit as the purchase price in the calculation. If the amount of goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded amount of goodwill, the recorded goodwill is written down to the new amount. At December31, 2011, the Companys remaining goodwill resided in its discontinued Downstream business and had been evaluated for impairment on a worldwide basis.
n Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization of PP&E on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP&E are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).
n Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment  PP&E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.
The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. The impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.
n Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities  Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
n Maintenance and Repairs  Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.
83 Table of Contents n Property Dispositions  When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the Gain on dispositions line of our consolidated income statement. When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.
n Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs  The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and PP&E. Over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in PP&E is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. For additional information, see Note10Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for additional information.
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.
n Guarantees  The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.
n Stock-Based Compensation  We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
n Income Taxes  Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.
n Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities  Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net in taxes other than income taxes.
n Net Income Per Share of Common Stock  Basic net income per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock, 84 Table of Contents along with an adjustment to net income for dividend equivalents paid on unvested unit awards that are considered participating securities. Diluted net income per share of common stock includes unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share, primarily under the treasury-stock method. Treasury stock and shares held by grantor trusts are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. The earnings per share impact of the participating securities is immaterial.
Note 2  Discontinued Operations Separation of Downstream Business On April30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. After the close of the New York Stock Exchange on April30, 2012, the shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April16, 2012 (the Record Date), received one share of Phillips 66 common stock for every two ConocoPhillips common shares held as of the Record Date.
In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution, primarily using the proceeds from the $5.8 billion in Senior Notes issued by Phillips 66 in March 2012, as well as a portion of the approximately $3.6 billion in cash transferred to Phillips 66 at separation, comprised of funds received from the $2.0 billion term loan entered into by Phillips 66 immediately prior to the separation, and approximately $1.6 billion of cash held by Phillips 66 subsidiaries. Pursuant to the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, the principal funds from the special cash distribution will be used solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution. At December31, 2012, the remaining balance of the cash distribution was $748 million and was included in the Restricted cash line on our consolidated balance sheet.
In order to effect the separation and govern our relationship with Phillips 66 after the separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, an Indemnification and Release Agreement, an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and a Transition Services Agreement. The Separation and Distribution Agreement governs the separation of the Downstream business, the transfer of assets and other matters related to our relationship with Phillips 66. The Indemnification and Release Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters. The Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement governs the allocation of intellectual property rights and assets between Phillips 66 and us.
The Tax Sharing Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips with respect to taxes, tax attributes, tax returns, tax proceedings and certain other tax matters. In addition, the Tax Sharing Agreement imposed certain restrictions on Phillips 66 and its subsidiaries (including restrictions on share issuances, business combinations, sales of assets and similar transactions) that are designed to preserve the tax-free status of the distribution and certain related transactions. The Tax Sharing Agreement sets forth the obligations of Phillips 66 and us as to the filing of tax returns, the administration of tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation on tax matters.
The Employee Matters Agreement governs the compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the current and former employees and non-employee directors of Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips, and generally allocates liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation, benefit plans and programs. The Employee Matters Agreement provides that employees of Phillips 66 will no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by ConocoPhillips. In addition, the Employee Matters Agreement provides that each of the parties will be responsible for their respective current employees and compensation plans for such current employees, and we will be responsible for liabilities relating to former employees who left prior to the separation (other than in certain instances where a plan or program was sponsored by a company that became part of the Phillips 66 group of companies at the separation). The Employee Matters 85 Table of Contents Agreement sets forth the general principles relating to employee matters and also addresses any special circumstances during the transition period. The Employee Matters Agreement also provides that (i)the distribution does not constitute a change in control under existing plans, programs, agreements or arrangements, and (ii)the distribution and the assignment, transfer or continuation of the employment of employees with another entity will not constitute a severance event under the applicable plans, programs, agreements or arrangements.
The Transition Services Agreement sets forth the terms on which we will provide Phillips 66, and Phillips 66 will provide to us, certain services or functions Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips historically have shared. Transition services include administrative, payroll, human resources, data processing, environmental health and safety, financial audit support, financial transaction support, and other support services, information technology systems and various other corporate services. The agreement provides for the provision of specified transition services, generally for a period of up to 12 months, with a possible extension of 6 months (an aggregate of 18 months), on a cost or a cost-plus basis.
The following table presents the carrying value of the major categories of assets and liabilities of Phillips 66, reflected on our consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2011: Millionsof Dollars Assets Accounts and notes receivable $ 8,353 Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties 1,671 Inventories 3,403 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 443 Total current assets of discontinued operations 13,870 Investments and long-term receivables 10,304 Loans and advancesrelated parties 1 Net properties, plants and equipment 15,047 Goodwill 3,332 Intangibles 732 Other assets 121 Total assets of discontinued operations $ 43,407 Liabilities Accounts payable $ 10,007 Accounts payablerelated parties 785 Short-term debt 30 Accrued income and other taxes 967 Employee benefit obligations 76 Other accruals 411 Total current liabilities of discontinued operations 12,276 Long-term debt 361 Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs 787 Deferred income taxes 5,533 Employee benefit obligations 1,057 Other liabilities and deferred credits 417 Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 20,431 86 Table of Contents Sales and other operating revenues and income from discontinued operations related to Phillips 66 were as follows: Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Sales and other operating revenues from discontinued operations $ 62,109 196,068 146,542 Income from discontinued operations before-tax $ 1,768 6,776 1,438 Income tax expense 534 1,729 470 Income from discontinued operations $ 1,234 5,047 968 Income from discontinued operations after-tax includes transaction, information systems and other costs incurred to effect the separation of $70 million and $17 million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. No separation costs were incurred in 2010.
Prior to the separation, commodity sales to Phillips 66 were $4,973 million for the year ended December31, 2012; $15,822 million for the year ended December31, 2011; and $13,412 million for the year ended December31, 2010. Commodity purchases from Phillips 66 prior to the separation were $166 million for the year ended December31, 2012; $516million for the year ended December31, 2011; and $479 million for the year ended December31, 2010. Prior to May1, 2012, commodity sales and related costs were eliminated in consolidation between ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Beginning May1, 2012, these revenues and costs represent third-party transactions with Phillips 66. Although we expect certain transactions related to the sale and purchase of crude oil, natural gas and products to continue in the future with Phillips 66, the expected continuing cash flows are not considered significant; thus, the operations and cash flows of our former Downstream business are considered to be eliminated from our ongoing operations.
Other Discontinued Operations As part of our ongoing strategic asset disposition program, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Algerian and Nigerian businesses (collectively, the Disposition Group). The Disposition Group is part of the Other International operating segment.
On November26, 2012, we notified government authorities in Kazakhstan and co-ventures of our intent to sell the Companys 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan to ONGC Videsh Limited. Expected proceeds are approximately $5 billion, which represents the purchase price plus expected working capital and customary adjustments at closing. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2013. We recorded a pre-tax impairment of $606 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 to reduce the carrying value to fair value, less costs to sell. As of December31, 2012, the carrying value of the net assets related to our interest in Kashagan after the impairment adjustment was $5 billion.
On December18, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Pertamina to sell our wholly owned subsidiary, ConocoPhillips Algeria Ltd., for a total of $1.75 billion plus customary adjustments. The transaction is anticipated to close by mid-2013. We received a deposit of $175 million in December 2012, which is included in the Other accruals line on our consolidated balance sheet and in the Other line of cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. The deposit is refundable in the event our co-venturer exercises its preemptive rights, which have been waived, or government approval is not received. As of December31, 2012, the net carrying value of our Algerian assets was $669 million.
On December20, 2012, we entered into agreements with affiliates of Oando PLC to sell our Nigerian business unit for a total of $1.79 billion plus customary adjustments. The transaction is anticipated to close by mid-2013, following appropriate consultations with stakeholders. We received a deposit of $435 million in December 2012, which is included in the Other accruals line on our consolidated balance sheet and in the Other line of cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. The deposit 87 Table of Contents is only refundable in the event of default by us. As of December31, 2012, the net carrying value of our Nigerian assets was $323 million.
At December31, 2012, we classified $29 million of loans and advances to related parties in the Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties line and $6,905 million of noncurrent assets in the Prepaid expenses and other current assets line of our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we classified $759 million of noncurrent liabilities in the Accrued income and other taxes line and $131 million of asset retirement obligations in the Other accruals line of our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities associated with the Disposition Group at December31 were as follows: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Assets Accounts and notes receivable $ 268 255 Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties 1 4 Inventories 44 48 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 220 279 Total current assets of discontinued operations 533 586 Investments and long-term receivables 272 261 Loans and advancesrelated parties 29 13 Net properties, plants and equipment 6,629 6,657 Other assets 4 9 Total assets of discontinued operations $ 7,467 7,526 Liabilities Accounts payable $ 471 644 Accrued income and other taxes 125 185 Employee benefit obligations - 1 Total current liabilities of discontinued operations 596 830 Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs 131 138 Deferred income taxes 759 989 Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 1,486 1,957 Sales and other operating revenues and income from discontinued operations related to the Disposition Group during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 2010 Sales and other operating revenues from discontinued operations $ 1,369 1,560 1,081 Income (loss) from discontinued operations before-tax $ (6 ) 829 437 Income tax expense 211 562 293 Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (217 ) 267 144 88 Table of Contents Note 3  Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information on our significant VIEs follows: Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) We have an agreement with Freeport LNG to participate in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we own a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which serves as the general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding was $565 million at December31, 2012. Freeport LNG is a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG, and the limited partners of Freeport LNG do not have any substantive decision making ability. Since we do not have the unilateral power to direct the key activities which most significantly impact its economic performance, we are not the primary beneficiary of Freeport LNG. These key activities primarily involve or relate to operating and maintaining the terminal. We also performed an analysis of the expected losses and determined we are not the primary beneficiary. This expected loss analysis took into account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to maintain sufficient commercial insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is accounted for as a financial asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity investment.
Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. We are not the primary beneficiary of APLNG because we share with Origin Energy and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) the power to direct the key activities of APLNG that most significantly impact its economic performance, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of coalbed methane, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate APLNG, and it is accounted for as an equity method investment.
As of December31, 2012, we have not provided, nor do we expect to provide in the future, any financial support to APLNG other than amounts previously contractually required. In addition, unless we elect otherwise, we have no requirement to provide liquidity or purchase the assets of APLNG. See Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 13Guarantees, for additional information.
Note 4  Inventories Inventories at December31 were: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Crude oil and petroleum products $ 244 3,633 Materials, supplies and other 721 998 $ 965 4,631 Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $147 million and $3,387million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted to approximately $200million and $8,400 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2012, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased net income from continuing operations by $32 million.

In January 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of our properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline (CCA) to Denbury Resources for $1.05 billion plus customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013. CCA is included in our Lower 48 and Latin America segment. At December31, 2012, the asset was considered held for sale. In December 2012, we recorded a pre-tax impairment of $192 million to reduce the carrying value to fair value. We also reclassified $1.08 billion of related noncurrent assets, primarily PP&E, to Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $426 million of noncurrent liabilities, comprised of deferred tax liabilities and asset retirement obligations (ARO), to Accrued income and other taxes and Other accruals.

APLNG In 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. APLNG is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. This transaction gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position with the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin is the operator of APLNGs production and pipeline system, while we will operate the LNG facility.
In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest diluting to 42.5percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011, and we recorded a loss on disposition of $279 million before- and after-tax from the dilution. The book value of our investment in APLNG was reduced by $795 million, and we reduced the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $516 million.
In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for the sale and purchase of an additional 3.3million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035. This agreement, in combination with the execution of an LNG sale and purchase agreement with The Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc., in June 2012 for approximately 1.0million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, finalized the marketing of the second train.
92 Table of Contents In July 2012, the APLNG co-venturers sanctioned the development of a second 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG production train. Upon sanctioning of the second train in July and in conjunction with the LNG sales agreement, Sinopec subscribed to additional shares in APLNG, which increased its equity interest from 15percent to 25 percent. As a result, on July12, 2012, both our ownership interest and Origins ownership interest diluted from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We recorded a before- and after-tax loss of $133 million from the dilution in the third quarter of 2012. The book value of our investment in APLNG was reduced by $453 million, and we reduced the foreign currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $320 million.
In addition, APLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2012. The $8.5 billion project finance facility is composed of financing agreements executed by APLNG with the Export-Import Bank of the United States for approximately $2.9 billion, the Export-Import Bank of China for approximately $2.7 billion, and a syndicate of Australian and international commercial banks for approximately $2.9 billion. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility which will be released upon meeting certain completion milestones. See Note 13Guarantees, for additional information.
APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. See Note 3Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) for additional information.
At December31, 2012, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $10,394million, which includes $2,568 million of cumulative translation effects due to a strengthening Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The historical cost basis of our 37.5percent share of net assets on the books of APLNG under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles was $3,961 million, resulting in a basis difference of $6,433million on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis difference, $4,686million associated with PP&E, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by APLNG, most of which are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization. As the joint venture begins producing natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net income attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was after-tax expense of $19million, $17 million and $5million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently producing licenses.
FCCL FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream 50/50 general partnership with Cenovus Energy Inc., produces bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta and sells the bitumen blend. We account for our investment in FCCL under the equity method of accounting, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL converted to reflect the use of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.
At December31, 2012, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $9,972 million. FCCLs operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in 2007. For additional information on this obligation, see Note 12Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation.
QG3 QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $1,092 million as described below under Loans and Long-term Receivables. At December31, 2012, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3 excluding the project financing was $984million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG 93 Table of Contents Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, in which we have a 12.4 percent interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United States.
Loans and Long-term Receivables As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreements stated interest rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully recovered.
At December31, 2012, significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:  $565 million in loan financing to Freeport LNG Development, L.P. for the construction of an LNG receiving terminal that became operational in June 2008. Freeport began making repayments in 2008 and is required to continue making repayments through full repayment of the loan in 2026. Repayment by Freeport is supported by process-or-pay capacity service payments made by us to Freeport under our terminal use agreement.
$1,092 million in project financing to QG3. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, for which we use the equity method of accounting. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum and Mitsui. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Semi-annual repayments began in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.
The long-term portion of these loans are included in the Loans and advancesrelated parties line on our consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties.
Note 7  Suspended Wells The following table reflects the net changes in suspended exploratory well costs during 2012, 2011, and 2010: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 2010 Beginning balance at January1 $ 1,037 1,013 908 Additions pending the determination of proved reserves 185 96 216 Reclassifications to proved properties (144) (72) (106) Sales of suspended well investment (18) - (4) Charged to dry hole expense (22) - (1) Ending balance at December31 $ 1,038 * 1,037 1,013 *Includes $190 million of assets held for sale  $133 million in Kazakhstan and $57 million in Nigeria.

95 Table of Contents Note 8  Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, all associated with the Downstream business, were as follows: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Goodwill balance as of January1 $ 3,332 3,633 Goodwill allocated to assets held for sale or sold - (273) Tax and other adjustments (2 ) (28) Separation of Downstream business (3,330 ) - Goodwill balance as of December31 $ - 3,332 Intangible Assets At year-end 2012, our intangible asset balance was $4 million, compared with $745 million at year-end 2011. Intangible assets of $730 million related to our Downstream business and were transferred to Phillips 66 upon the separation.
Note 9  Impairments During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 2010 Alaska $ 3 2 6 Lower 48 and Latin America 192 71 19 Canada 262 253 13 Europe 211 (37 ) 43 Asia Pacific and Middle East 4 - - Corporate 8 32 - $ 680 321 81 2012 In 2012, we recorded a $192 million property impairment in the Lower 48 and Latin America segment related to the planned disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, located in southwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana.
The Canada segment included a $213million property impairment for the carrying value of capitalized project development costs associated with our Mackenzie Gas Project. Advancement of the project was suspended indefinitely in the first quarter of 2012 due to a continued decline in market conditions and the lack of acceptable commercial terms. We also recorded a $481 million impairment for the undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the project, which was included in the Exploration expenses line on our consolidated income statement. Additionally, we recorded impairments on various producing and non-producing properties.
In Europe, we recorded impairments of $211 million, mainly related to ARO revisions for properties which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives.
96 Table of Contents 2011 During 2011, we recorded property impairments of $289 million, primarily in our Lower 48 and Latin America and Canada segments, largely as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions and reduced volume forecasts.
2010 During 2010, we recorded various property impairments of $81 million, primarily in our Europe and Lower 48 and Latin America segments.
Note 10  Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December31 were: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Asset retirement obligations $ 9,164 8,920 Accrued environmental costs 364 922 Total asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs 9,528 9,842 Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs due within one year* (581 ) (513) Long-term asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs $ 8,947 9,329 *Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet under Other accruals and includes $158 million of liabilities associated with assets held for sale at December31, 2012.
Asset Retirement Obligations We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.
We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska.
During 2012 and 2011, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Balance at January1 $ 8,920 8,776 Accretion of discount 412 435 New obligations 315 153 Changes in estimates of existing obligations 543 29 Spending on existing obligations (319 ) (327) Property dispositions (607 ) (60) Foreign currency translation 281 (86) Separation of Downstream business (381 ) - Balance at December31 $ 9,164 8,920 97 Table of Contents Accrued Environmental Costs Total accrued environmental costs at December31, 2012 and 2011, were $364 million and $922million, respectively. A significant portion of our environmental contingencies at December31, 2011, related to our Downstream business. See Note 2Discontinued Operations, for additional information. The remaining 2012 decrease in total accrued environmental costs is due to payments and settlements during the year exceeding new accruals, accrual adjustments and accretion.
We had accrued environmental costs of $279million and $571million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the U.S. at operated sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $70million and $274million of environmental costs associated with nonoperator sites at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, $15million and $77 million were included at both December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.
Because a large portion of the accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected expenditures for acquired environmental obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $142 million at December31, 2012. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $20 million in 2013, $16 million in 2014, $14 million in 2015, $8 million in 2016, $7 million in 2017, and $98million for all future years after2017.

At December31, 2012, we classified $964 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facilities.
During 2012, the following new debt instruments were issued:  The $1,000 million 1.05% Notes due 2017.
The $1,000 million 2.40% Notes due 2022.
During 2012, the following debt instruments were repaid:  The $400 million 4.40% Notes due 2013, repaid before maturity.
$1,100 million of the $1,500 million 4.75% Notes due 2014, repaid before maturity.
The $897 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012, repaid at maturity.
We incurred a before-tax loss on redemption of $79 million related to the two debt instruments we repaid before maturity, consisting of a make-whole premium and unamortized issuance costs.
In May 2012, we decreased our total revolving credit facilities from $8.0 billion to $7.5 billion by terminating all commitments under the $500 million credit facility which was due to expire in July 2012. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
We have two commercial paper programs: the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion program, primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At both December31, 2012 and 2011, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, with no letters of credit as of December31, 2012, and $40 million as of December31, 2011. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $1,055 million of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2012, compared with $1,128 million at December31, 2011. Since we had $1,055 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.4 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December31, 2012.
Note 12  Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to FCCL. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, $772 million was short-term and was included in the Accounts payablerelated parties line on our December31, 2012 consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $733 million in 2012, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed 100 Table of Contents annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Note 13  Guarantees At December31, 2012, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability at inception for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were issued prior to December31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
APLNG Guarantees At December31, 2012, we have outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 37.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2012 exchange rates:  We have guaranteed APLNGs performance with regard to a construction contract executed in connection with APLNGs issuance of the Train 1 and Train 2 Notices to Proceed. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee is 4 years. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to this guarantee is approximately $180million and would become payable if APLNG cancels the applicable construction contract and does not perform with respect to the amounts owed to the contractor.
We have issued a construction completion guarantee related to the third-party project financing secured by APLNG. Our maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is estimated to be $3.2 billion, which could be payable if the full debt financing capacity is utilized and completion of the project is not achieved. Our guarantee of the project financing will be released upon meeting certain completion milestones, which we estimate would occur beginning in 2016. Our maximum exposure at December31, 2012, is $860 million based upon our pro-rata share of the facility used at that date. At December31, 2012, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately $114 million.
In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy in October 2008, we agreed to guarantee an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements with remaining terms of 4 to 19 years. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $1.0 billion ($2.4 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.
We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the projects continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of up to 33 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $150million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform.
101 Table of Contents Guarantees of Joint Venture Debt At December31, 2012, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture debt obligations, which have remaining terms of up to 23 years. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is approximately $60 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations.
Other Guarantees We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately $270million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate aircraft, guarantees to fund the short-term cash liquidity deficit of two joint ventures and a guarantee of minimum charter revenue for an LNG vessel. These guarantees have remaining terms of up to 11 years or life of the venture.
Indemnifications Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December31, 2012, was approximately $70 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the recorded carrying amount were approximately $50million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in the Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs line on our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 14Contingencies and Commitments.
In connection with the separation of the Downstream business, the Company entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement with Phillips 66. See Note 2Discontinued Operations, for additional information. This agreement provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips and established proceduresfor handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters. We evaluated the impact of the indemnifications given and the Phillips 66 indemnifications received as of the separation date and concluded those fair values were immaterial.
Note 14Contingencies and Commitments A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See Note 20Income Taxes, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
102 Table of Contents Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Environmental We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on managements best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies cleanup experience, and data released by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 10Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.
Legal Proceedings Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
103 Table of Contents Other Contingencies We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December31, 2012, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $852 million(issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan governments Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuelas national oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA),or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November2, 2007, with the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we anticipate an interim decision on key legal and factual issues in 2013. In a separate commercial arbitration from the Companys ICSID claim discussed above, an International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) tribunal issued a decision in favor of the Company in September 2012, finding PDVSA owed $67 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements. In November 2012, based on the ICC tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million, including post-judgment interest, which resulted in a $61million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax, associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual, which is recorded in the Other income line on our consolidated income statement.
In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil.In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. On April24, 2012, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe are not material. The ICSID tribunal issued a decisionon liabilityon December14, 2012, in favor of Burlington, finding that Ecuadors seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration phase will take place to determine thedamagesowed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuadors actions.
ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax assessments. Between 2010 and 2012, ConocoPhillips has paid, under protest, tax assessments totaling approximately $227 million, which are primarily recorded in the Investments and long-term receivables line on our December31, 2012, consolidated balance sheet. The arbitration will be conducted in Singapore under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste Government. The arbitration process is currently underway. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.
Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the Companys business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2013$137 million; 2014$136 million; 2015$127 million; 2016$28million; 2017$28 million; and 2018 and after$158 million. Totalpayments under the agreements were $130million in 2012, $429million in 2011 and $216million in 2010.
104 Table of Contents Note 15Derivative and Financial Instruments We use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to meet our customer needs and capture market opportunities. Our commodity business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, LNG and natural gas liquids. Under our current business model, we are not required to register as a Swap Dealer or Major Swap Participant.
Our derivative instruments are held at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Where these balances have the right of setoff, they are presented net. Related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. On the consolidated income statement, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if directly related to our physical business or a net basis if held for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts that meet and are designated with the normal purchase normal sale exception are recognized upon settlement. We generally apply this exception to eligible crude contracts. We do not use hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives.
The following table presents the gross fair values of our commodity derivatives, excluding collateral, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 1,538 4,433 Other assets 105 415 Liabilities Other accruals 1,509 4,350 Other liabilities and deferred credits 99 374 The gains (losses) incurred from commodity derivatives, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated income statement were: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 2010 Sales and other operating revenues $ (291 ) 907 (964) Other income (1 ) (9 ) (5) Purchased commodities 214 (729 ) 915 The table below summarizes our material net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative contracts.

Our foreign currency exchange derivative activity primarily consists of transactions designed to mitigate our cash-related and 105 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital programs or local currency tax payments, dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates. We do not elect hedge accounting on our foreign currency exchange derivatives.

**Primarily Norwegian krone and British pound.
***Primarily Canadian dollar, euro and Norwegian krone.
Financial Instruments We invest excess cash in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we manage. The maturities of these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90days. The types of financial instruments include:  Time deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with approved financial institutions.
Commercial paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank, or government agency purchased at a discount, maturing at par.
These financial instruments appear in the Cash and cash equivalents line of our consolidated balance sheet if the maturities at the time we made the investments were 90 days or less; otherwise, these held-to-maturity investments are included in the Short-term investments line. At December31, we held the following financial instruments: 106 Table of Contents Millions of Dollars Carrying Amount CashandCashEquivalents Short-TermInvestments 2012 2011 2012 2011 Cash $ 829 1,169 - - Time Deposits Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days 2,789 4,318 - 349 Commercial Paper Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days - 293 - 232 $ 3,618 5,780 - 581 In conjunction with the separation of our Downstream business, we received a special cash distribution from Phillips 66 of $7,818 million. See Note 2Discontinued Operations, for additional information. At December31, 2012, the unused amount of the special cash distribution was $748 million and is designated as Restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. At December31, 2012, the funds in the restricted cash account were invested in money market funds with maturities within 90 days from December31, 2012.
Credit Risk Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds, government debt securities and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.
The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New York Mercantile Exchange or IntercontinentalExchange.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December31, 2012, was $130 million, for which no collateral was posted. If our credit rating were lowered one level from its A rating (per Standard and Poors) on December31, 2012, we 107 Table of Contents would be required to post no additional collateral to our counterparties. If we were downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post $130 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
Note 16Fair Value Measurement We carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at a reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.
The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities that are initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available. Transfers occur at the end of the reporting period. There were no material transfers in or out of Level 1.
Recurring Fair Value Measurement Financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include commodity derivatives and certain investments to support nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The deferred compensation investments are measured at fair value using unadjusted prices available from national securities exchanges; therefore, these assets are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data. Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are long term in nature and where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available. The derived value uses industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures. The use of these inputs results in managements best estimate of fair value. Level3 activity was not material.

** Before-tax loss includes $1 million related to discontinued operations.
*** Before-tax loss includes $4 million related to discontinued operations.
2012 Net PP&E held for sale was written down to fair value, less costs to sell. The fair value of each asset was determined by its binding negotiated selling price.
Net PP&E held for use is comprised of various producing properties impaired to their individual fair values. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices from futures exchanges and pricing service companies, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.
109 Table of Contents 2011 During 2011, net PP&E held for use with a carrying amount of $427million was written down to a fair value of $162million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $265million. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar assets and alternative use.
Also during 2011, certain equity method investments were determined to have fair values below their carrying amount, and the impairments were considered to be other than temporary. This primarily included an investment associated with our Other International segment with a book value of $651million, which was written down to its fair value of $256million, resulting in a charge of $395million before-tax. This was included in the Equity in earnings of affiliates line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain similar undeveloped properties.
Reported Fair Values of Financial Instruments We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:  Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion of fixed-rate related party loans is consistent with Loans and advancesrelated parties.
Loans and advancesrelated parties: The carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value. The fair value of fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information.
Accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt: The carrying amount of accounts payable and floating-rate debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion of the joint venture acquisition obligation is consistent with the methodology below.
Fixed-rate debt: The estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Joint venture acquisition obligationrelated party: Fair value is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows as a Level 2 fair value, discounted at December31, 2012, and December31, 2011, effective yield rates of 0.7percent and 1.24percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S.Treasury securities of similar average duration adjusted for our average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. See Note 12Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for additional information.

Note 18Non-Mineral Leases The company leases ocean transport vessels, tugboats, barges, corporate aircraft, drilling equipment, computers, office buildings and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property for the fair market value at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing agreements with regard to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability. Leased assets under capital leases were not significant in any period presented.

112 Table of Contents Note 19Employee Benefit Plans Pension and Postretirement Plans In connection with the separation of the Downstream business, ConocoPhillips entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Phillips 66, see Note 2Discontinued Operations, which provides that employees of Phillips 66 no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by ConocoPhillips as of the separation date. Upon separation, the ConocoPhillips pension and postretirement plans transferred assets and obligations to the Phillips 66 plans resulting in a net decrease in sponsored pension and postretirement plan obligations of $1,127 million. Additionally, as a result of the transfer of unrecognized losses to Phillips 66, deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income decreased $335 million and $570 million, respectively.

None was recognized in 2010. In 2012, lump-sum benefit payments from the U.S. qualified pension plan exceeded the sum of service and interest costs for that plan and led to an increase in settlement losses.
In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.
We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 7.5percent in 2012 that declines to 5percent by 2023. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.
Plan Assets We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 59percent equity securities, 37 percent debt securities and 4 percent real estate. Generally, the plan investments are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December31, 2012 and 2011.
Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level1 are primarily based on quoted market prices.
Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. When observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on 116 Table of Contents pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
Fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates. U.S. cash balances held in the form of short-term fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as Level 2.
Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party sources.
Private equity funds are valued at net asset value as determined by the issuer based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans participants.
Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The participating interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as the fair value is determined via a combination of quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations. At December31, 2012, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $133 million and consisted of $358 million in debt securities, less $225 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December31, 2011, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $144 million and consisted of $391 million in debt securities, less $247million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The net change from 2011 to 2012 is due to a decrease in the fair value of the underlying investments of $33 million and a decrease in the present value of the contract obligation of $22 million. The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

Level 3 activity was not material.
Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2013, we expect to contribute approximately $275 118 Table of Contents million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans and $210million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of their eligible pay up to the statutory limit ($17,000 in 2012) in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 38 investment funds. Through 2012, ConocoPhillips matched contribution deposits, up to 1.25 percent of eligible pay. Company contributions charged to expense related to continuing and discontinued operations for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below), were $16 million in 2012, $25million in 2011, and $24 million in 2010.
The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Through 2012, employees could elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to the amount of contribution.
In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of company common stock. Since the Company guarantees the CPSPs borrowings, the unpaid balance is reported as a liability of the Company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common stockholders equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In 2012, the final debt service payment was made and all remaining unallocated shares were released for allocation to participant accounts.
We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to continuing and discontinued operations to the stock savings feature of $104million, $77million and $92million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, all of which was compensation expense. In 2012 and 2011, we made cash contributions to the CPSP of $5 million and $4million, respectively. No cash contributions were made in 2010. In 2011 and 2010, we contributed 660,755 shares and 1,776,873 shares, respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust. The shares had a fair value of $84 million and $103 million, respectively. In 2012 and 2011, we contributed 1,554,355 and 475,696 shares, respectively, of company common stock from treasury stock. Dividends used to service debt were $10million, $45million and $41million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $0.1 million, $1million and $2million, respectively.

Starting in 2013, employees who participate in the CPSP and contribute 1 percent of their eligible pay will receive a 9 percent company cash match. CPSP will no longer have a stock savings feature.
We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense related to continuing and discontinued operations recognized for these international plans was approximately $56 million in 2012 and 2011 and $52million in 2010.
Share-Based Compensation Plans The 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2011. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 100million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees and directors; however, as of the effective date of the Plan, (i)any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii)any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the 100million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options, and no more than 40million shares are available for awards in stock.
Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement. We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture. Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
Separation-Related Adjustments In connection with the separation of the Downstream business on April30, 2012, ConocoPhillips entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Phillips 66, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations, which provides that employees of Phillips 66 no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by ConocoPhillips. Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, we made certain adjustments, using volumetric weighted-average prices for the 4-day period immediately prior to and immediately following the separation, to the exercise price and number of our share-based compensation awards, with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value of the awards immediately prior to the separation. These adjustments are summarized as follows and are reflected in the activity tables below:  Outstanding options to purchase common shares of ConocoPhillips stock that were exercisable prior to the separation were adjusted so that the holders of the options would then hold one option to purchase common shares of Phillips 66 stock for every two adjusted stock options to purchase common shares of ConocoPhillips stock following the separation.
120 Table of Contents  Nonexercisable stock options and restricted stock units were converted to those of the entity where the employee holding them is working immediately post-separation. Therefore, nonexercisable stock options to purchase common shares of ConocoPhillips stock and ConocoPhillips restricted stock units held by an employee who separated with the Downstream business were surrendered as a result of the separation.
In addition, former employee holders and a specified group of holders of stock options and restricted stock units who retired or terminated employment upon or shortly after the separation received both adjusted ConocoPhillips awards and Philips 66 awards.
ConocoPhillips restricted stock and performance share units awarded for completed performance periods under the Performance Share Program, as well as vested restricted stock units held by current or former directors, were adjusted to provide holders one restricted share or restricted stock unit of Phillips 66 stock for every two restricted shares or restricted stock units of ConocoPhillips stock.
The separation-related adjustments did not have a material impact on either compensation expense or the potentially dilutive securities to be considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock.
Compensation Expense Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Compensation cost $ 321 246 211 Tax benefit 118 86 78 Stock Options Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and prior plans permit purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to certain employees already eligible for retirement vest within 6 months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock option awards granted during 2011 and 2010 was $16.70 and $11.70, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2011 and 2010 was $416 million and $183 million, respectively.
During 2012, we received $294 million in cash and realized a tax benefit related to continuing and discontinued operations of $153 million from the exercise of options. At December31, 2012, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $9 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.66 years, the longest period being 2.11 years.
The fair market values of the options granted over the past three years were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. During 2012, all stock option grants occurred prior to the separation of the Downstream business. The weighted-average assumptions used were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Assumptions used Risk-free interest rate 1.62 % 3.10 3.23 Dividend yield 4.00 % 4.00 4.00 Volatility factor 33.30 % 33.40 33.80 Expected life (years) 7.42 6.87 6.65 The ranges in the assumptions used were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 High Low High Low High Low Ranges used Risk-free interest rate 1.62 % 1.62 3.10 3.10 3.23 3.23 Dividend yield 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 Volatility factor 33.30 33.30 33.40 33.40 33.80 33.80 122 Table of Contents Expected volatility above was based on historical volatility of the companys stock using ConocoPhillips end-of-week closing stock prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the options granted. We periodically calculate the average period of time lapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the expected life of new option grants. Due to the separation of our Downstream business, our calculation of expected volatility for grants of options in 2013 will be based on a three-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies.
Stock Unit Program Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan and vest ratably, with one-third of the units vesting in 36 months, one-third vesting in 48 months, and the final third vesting 60 months from the date of grant. Beginning with restricted stock units granted in 2013, the general vesting schedule will accelerate with units vesting 36 months from the date of grant. In addition, beginning in 2012, restricted stock units are granted under the Plan for a variable long-term incentive program, with one-third of units vesting in 12 months, one-third vesting in 24 months, and the final one-third vesting 36months from the date of grant. Restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award. Upon vesting, the units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to certain employees already eligible for retirement vest six months from the grant date, but those units are not issued as shares until the end of the normal vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. The grant date fair value of these units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock unit awards granted during 2011 and 2010 was $67.54 and $46.38, respectively. The total fair value of stock units issued during 2011 and 2010 was $109 million and $79 million, respectively.
Performance Share Program Under the Plan, we also annually grant to senior management restricted performance share units (PSUs) that do not vest until either (i)with respect to awards for performance periods beginning before 2009, the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or (ii)with respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009, five years after the grant date of the award (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until retirement after reaching age 55 with five years of service), so we recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for such retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. These PSUs are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Until issued 123 Table of Contents as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. In its current form, the first grant of PSUs under this program was in 2006.
During 2012, performance share awards previously authorized but not yet granted prior to the separation with our Downstream business were granted and a pro-rata number of performance share stock units were awarded to the employee participants.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share units granted during 2011 and 2010 was $70.57 and $48.39, respectively. The total fair value of performance share units issued during 2011 and 2010 was $37 million and $12 million, respectively.
Other In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares and units granted during 2011 and 2010 was $70.25 and $53.33, respectively. The total fair value of restricted shares and units issued during 2011 and 2010 was $10 million and $9 million, respectively.

The reduction in net deferred tax liabilities from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the separation of our Downstream business. See Note 2Discontinued Operations for more information.
125 Table of Contents We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2013 and 2032 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.
Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2012, valuation allowances decreased a total of $142million. This reflects decreases of $516 million primarily related to the separation of our Downstream business, asset relinquishment and utilization of loss carryforwards, partially offset by increases of $374 million, primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credit and foreign and state loss carryforwards. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.
At December31, 2012 and 2011, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $2,286 million and $4,227 million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed.
The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for 2012, 2011 and 2010: Millions of Dollars 2012 2011 2010 Balance at January1 $ 1,071 1,125 1,208 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 98 46 63 Additions for tax positions of prior years 48 145 344 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (206 ) (35 ) (199 ) Settlements (108 ) (206 ) (215 ) Lapse of statute (31 ) (4 ) (76 ) Balance at December31 $ 872 1,071 1,125 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $650 million, $815million and $914 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate.
At December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $129million, $141million and $171million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a benefit to earnings in 2012 of $9 million, a charge to earnings in 2011 of $10 million, and a benefit to earnings in 2010 of $2 million.
We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2009), Canada (2005), United States (2008)and Norway (2011). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.

The change in the effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to tax benefits associated with asset dispositions occurring in 2010.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July17, 2012, restricting corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent, retroactively effective from March21, 2012. Our 2012 earnings were reduced by $192 million due to remeasurement of deferred tax balances as of the effective date.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July19, 2011, which increased the supplementary corporate tax rate applicable to U.K. Upstream activity from 20 to 32 percent, retroactively effective from March24, 2011. This resulted in the overall U.K. corporate rate increasing from 50 percent to 62 percent. The enactment resulted in increased U.K. corporate income tax expense of $316 million in 2011. This is comprised of $106 million due to remeasurement of U.K. deferred tax liabilities, and $210 million to reflect the new rate from March24, 2011, through December31, 2011.
Statutory tax rate changes did not have a significant impact on our income tax expense in 2010.

See Note 5Assets Held for Sale or Sold, for additional information.
** We paid interest to, or received interest from, various affiliates, including FCCL Partnership. See Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information on loans to affiliated companies.
Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
On April30, 2012, our Downstream business was separated into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation, Phillips 66. In 2012, we also agreed to sell our Nigerian and Algerian businesses and our interest in Kashagan. As such, results for these operations have been reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Commodity sales to Phillips 66, which were previously eliminated in consolidation prior to the separation, are now reported as third-party sales. For additional information, see Note 2Discontinued Operations.
Our LUKOIL Investment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, ongoing costs associated with the separation and certain technology activities, net of licensing revenues.

134 Table of Contents Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited) In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic932, Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas, and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates oil and gas activities, covering both those in our operating segments, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, for periods prior to 2011, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At December31, 2012, approximately 9 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area.
Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United Kingdom), Russia, Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Caspian Region.
In the following disclosures, the synthetic oil classification included our past Syncrude mining operations, and the bitumen classification includes our Surmont operations and the FCCL Partnership. In June 2010, we sold our interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture; accordingly, as of December31, 2010, we no longer held synthetic oil reserves.
On July28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL over a period of time through the end of 2011. As a result of this sell down of our interest, at the end of the third quarter of 2010 we ceased using equity-method accounting for our investment in LUKOIL. Accordingly, the supplemental oil and gas disclosures reflect activity for LUKOIL through June30, 2010, which, on a lag basis, results in three quarters of activity being included in the year 2010 (the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010). Since the proved reserves tables are not on a lag basis, they reflect activity for the first three quarters of 2010, at which point LUKOILs reserves were removed from our reserve quantities.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in Kashagan, and the Algeria and Nigeria businesses, with closing on all three transactions expected by mid-2013. These businesses were considered held for sale at December31, 2012, and have been reported as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the Results of Operations, Average Sales Prices and Net Production tables included within the supplemental oil and gas disclosures reflect the associated earnings and production as discontinued operations.
In January 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of our properties in the Cedar Creek Anticline, with closing expected in the first quarter of 2013. At December31, 2012, the asset was considered held for sale.
The proved reserves associated with all these assets held for sale at December31, 2012, totaled 364million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) and are reflected in the following reserves tables.
135 Table of Contents Reserves Governance The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers in our Exploration and Production (E&P) business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business units reserve processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the Companys Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), reviews the business units reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal audit group. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.
During 2012, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December31, 2012, were reviewed by D&M, a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips technical staff presented D&M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Managements intent in retaining D&M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&Ms opinion was that the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December31, 2012, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&Ms report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
136 Table of Contents The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the companys reserve estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual is a petroleum engineer with a bachelors degree in civil engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience, including drilling and production engineering assignments in several field locations. He has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, reserves reporting and compliance, and business management.
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December31, 2012, included:  Revisions : In 2012, revisions in Lower 48 were primarily due to lower prices in 2012, versus 2011. In 2012, revisions in Canada were primarily due to lower prices in 2012, versus 2011, as well as improved well performance. In our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, revisions in 2012 were primarily due to development activities in various fields. Revisions in Africa in 2012 were primarily due the execution of a gas sales agreement. In 2010, revisions in Alaska, Lower 48 and Canada were primarily due to higher prices in 2010, versus 2009, as well as improved well performance.
Extensions and discoveries : In 2012, 2011 and 2010, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to continued drilling success in various fields. In 2012 and 2011, for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries were primarily due to APLNGs ongoing development drilling onshore Australia. In 2010, extensions and discoveries in Canada were primarily due to continued drilling success in various fields.
Sales : In 2012, for our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East, sales were primarily due to the dilution of our interest in APLNG. In 2010, for our equity affiliates in Russia, sales were primarily due to the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL.

In 2011, for our bitumen equity operations, revisions were primarily due to new subsurface interpretations, as well as the effects of higher prices on sliding scale royalty provisions.
Extensions and discoveries : In 2012, for our bitumen equity operations, extensions and discoveries were primarily related to the sanctioning of Christina Lake Phase F and Narrows Lake Phase A. In 2011, for our consolidated operations, extensions and discoveries were related to continued development of Surmont. In 2011 and 2010, for our equity affiliate operations, extensions and discoveries mainly reflect the continued development of FCCL.
Sales: In 2010, for synthetic oil consolidated operations, sales reflect the disposition of our interest in Syncrude.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves We had 3,017million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2012, compared with 2,465million BOE at year-end 2011. We converted 247million BOE of undeveloped reserves to developed during 2012 as we achieved startup of major development projects. In addition, we added 799million BOE of undeveloped reserves in 2012mainly through extensions and discoveries from ongoing development progress and exploration success, as well as through revisions. As a result, at December31, 2012, our proved undeveloped reserves represented 35 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 29 percent at December31, 2011. Costs incurred for the year ended December31, 2012, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $7.7billion.
Approximately 70percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2012 were associated with seven major development areas. Five of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:  FCCL oil sandsFoster Creek and Christina Lake in Canada.
The Surmont oil sands project in Canada.
The Ekofisk Field in the North Sea.
The Eagle Ford area in the Lower 48.
The remaining major projects include the Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan and Narrows Lake in our FCCL oil sands in Canada. In November, we announced our intention to sell our interest in Kashagan, and the transaction is expected to close by mid-2013. Narrows Lake was sanctioned for development in 2012.
147 Table of Contents At the end of 2012, we did not have any material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves in individual fields or countries that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. However, our largest concentrations of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2012 are located in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada, consisting of the FCCL and Surmont steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects. The majority of our remaining proved undeveloped reserves in this area were recorded beginning in 2007, and we expect a material portion of these reserves will remain undeveloped for more than five years.
Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent levels. The associated reserves are expected to be developed over many years as additional well pairs are drilled across the extensive resource base to maintain throughput at the central processing facilities.
Results of Operations The Companys results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 are shown in the following tables. Additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:  Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.
Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.
Transportation costs include costs to transport our produced hydrocarbons to their points of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process natural gas to natural gas liquids. The profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest is deemed to be outside oil and gas producing activities. The net income of the transportation operations is included in other earnings.
Other related expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous expenses.
Other earnings include non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, and crude oil and gas marketing activities.

154 Table of Contents Development and Exploration Activities The following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unknown field or a new reservoir within a proven field. Excluded from the exploratory well count are stratigraphic-type exploratory wells, primarily relating to oil sands delineation wells located in Canada and coalbed methane test wells located in Asia Pacific/Middle East.

160 Table of Contents Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities In accordance with SEC and FASB requirements, amounts were computed using 12-month average prices and end-of-year costs (adjusted only for existing contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor. Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing and amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.
While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

The net change in prices and production and transportation costs is the beginning-of-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual change in the per-unit sales price and production and transportation cost, discounted at 10 percent.
Purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the applicable reserve quantities for the year multiplied by the 12-month average sales prices, less future estimated costs, discounted at 10percent.
The accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior years discounted future cash inflows, less future production, transportation and development costs.
The net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income tax provisions.
