Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES CORPORATE STRUCTURE ConocoPhillips is the worlds largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August30, 2002.
On April30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and the sale of our Algeria business, and we have agreements to sell our Nigeria business. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note 3Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.
At December31, 2013, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 18,400 people worldwide.
1 Table of Contents SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December31, 2013, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia.
We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
The information listed below appears in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:  Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen reserves.
Net production of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.
Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and bitumen.
Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.
Developed and undeveloped acreage.
The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 83 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the following summary reserves table.

The decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production, due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and the impact from the closure of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012.
Our total realized price from continuing operations remained relatively flat in 2013, from $67.68 per BOE in 2012, compared with $67.62 per BOE in 2013. Our worldwide annual average crude oil sales price from continuing operations decreased 2 percent in 2013, from $105.72 per barrel in 2012 to $103.32 per barrel in 2013. Additionally, our worldwide average annual natural gas liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 11 percent, from $46.36 per barrel in 2012 to $41.42 per barrel in 2013. Our average annual worldwide natural gas sales price from continuing operations increased 11 percent, from $5.48 per thousand cubic feet in 2012 to $6.11 per thousand cubic feet in 2013. Average annual bitumen prices decreased 1percent, from $53.91 per barrel in 2012 to $53.27 per barrel in 2013.
3 Table of Contents ALASKA The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude oil and natural gas producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North Americas largest oil fields located on Alaskas North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaskas largest owners of state and federal exploration leases, with approximately 0.9million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2013. Approximately 0.5million of these acres are located in the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska (NPRA) and 0.3million are located in the Chukchi Sea. In 2013, Alaska operations contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production.

** Millions of cubic feet per day.
Greater Prudhoe Area The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaskas North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bays satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.
Greater Kuparuk Area We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. New rotary-drilled wells and sidetracks from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling are the primary means for development drilling at Kuparuk.
The successful Shark Tooth delineation well extended the known Kuparuk accumulation to the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field. As a result, plans for the future development of Drill Site 2S are progressing, with project sanction targeted for late 2014 and first production estimated in late 2015.
Western North Slope On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. Construction is progressing on Alpine West CD5, a drill site to access the western extension of the Alpine reservoir, in the NPRA. Initial production is anticipated in late 2015, with net peak production estimated at 10 MBOED in 2016.
The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPRA, was formed in 2008. We are progressing development planning for the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) drill site in the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit. We filed permitting applications for GMT1 in July 2013, and project sanction is targeted for late 2014. GMT1 is planned to be connected by road to the CD5 drill site, and production will be 4 Table of Contents transported by pipeline to the existing Alpine facilities for processing. Construction is estimated to begin in 2016, with first production anticipated in late 2017. We are evaluating further exploration and development potential in the NPRA.
Cook Inlet Area We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Facility, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Both units produce natural gas, and our share of production is currently sold to local utilities.
The Kenai LNG Facility includes a 1.3million-tons-per-year capacity plant, which historically manufactured LNG for sale to utility companies in Japan, as well as docking and loading facilities, which enable the LNG to be transported by tanker. Although our LNG export license expired in March 2013, the plant is operational and in stand-by mode, maintaining the flexibility to resume limited operations. Due to a change in market conditions, including additional gas supplies, we submitted applications in December 2013 to the U.S. Department of Energy to resume LNG exports from the Kenai LNG Facility.
Point Thomson We own a 5 percent interest in the Point Thomson Unit, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by 2016, which is estimated to send 400net BOED of condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).
More Alaska Production Act (MAPA) Following the April 2013 enactment of revised oil tax legislation, MAPA, we have increased our exploration and development investments and activities on the North Slope by adding rigs and progressing new development opportunities. We will continue to work with co-owners to identify additional opportunities to increase our investments in Alaska.
Alaska LNG (AKLNG) During 2012, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation (collectively, the AKLNG co-venturers), began evaluating a potential LNG project which would export and liquefy natural gas from Alaskas North Slope and deliver it to market. The AKLNG Project concept is an integrated LNG project consisting of a liquefaction plant, including marine terminal facilities and auxiliary marine vessels, located in south-central Alaska; a natural gas treatment plant, located on the North Slope; and an estimated 800-mile natural gas pipeline, which would connect the two plants.
In October 2013, the AKLNG co-venturers selected the Nikiski area on the Kenai Peninsula as the lead site for the proposed AKLNG natural gas liquefaction plant and terminal. On January14, 2014, the AKLNG co-venturers, the Commissioners of the Alaska Departments of Revenue and Natural Resources, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation, a state-owned corporation, signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) for the AKLNG Project. The HOA provides a roadmap of how the parties intend to progress the project, including proposed terms for participation by the State of Alaska as an equity owner, proposed fiscal and regulatory terms, and proposed terms for expansion of project components. One of the initial steps in the HOA is enactment of general legislation by the State of Alaska, as well as further commercial agreements, which would be subject to approval by the Alaska legislature. Significant engineering, technical, regulatory, fiscal, commercial and permitting issues would need to be resolved prior to a final investment decision on the potential 17million-tons-per-year, $45 billion to $65 billion (gross) project. Following the enabling legislation, we anticipate commencing preliminary front-end engineering and development, currently estimated in the second quarter of 2014.
5 Table of Contents Exploration In April 2013, we suspended our plans to drill an exploration well in the Chukchi Sea in 2014, in light of the uncertainties of evolving federal regulatory requirements and operational permitting standards. Once these requirements are clarified and better defined, we will re-evaluate plans for drilling in the Chukchi Sea.
In 2013, we drilled and flow-tested a new discovery at the Cassin prospect, located in the Bear Tooth Unit in the northeast NPRA, and we also tested the Moraine play on the western flank of the Kuparuk Field. The results for both wells are currently under evaluation. Additionally, we plan to drill two exploration wells within the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit in 2014: the Rendezvous 3, which is currently drilling, and Flattop-1, which is expected to be spud later in the first quarter of 2014.
Transportation We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 29.1percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled tankers and chartering third-party vessels, as necessary. The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, to refineries on the west coast of the United States.
6 Table of Contents LOWER 48 AND LATIN AMERICA The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states, as well as exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia. As a result of increasing shale opportunities and a low natural gas price environment, we have directed our investments toward high-margin, liquids-rich plays, predominantly in the Lower 48.
Lower 48 We hold 15.3million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2013, the Lower 48 contributed 29percent of our worldwide liquids production and 38 percent of our natural gas production.

Our unconventional holdings total approximately 2.7million net acres in the following areas:  620,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and Eastern Montana;  221,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas;  240,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico;  130,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado;  900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado;  65,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas; and  541,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays.
7 Table of Contents The majority of our 2013 onshore production originated from San Juan, Eagle Ford, Permian, Bakken, Anadarko, Lobo and Barnett. Onshore activities in 2013 were centered mostly on continued development and optimization of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with higher-margin, liquids-rich production, particularly in growing unconventional plays. Our major focus areas in 2013 included the following:  Eagle FordExploration and development continued in 2013 in the Eagle Ford. In 2013, we increased production by 70 percent, compared to 2012; drilled 164 exploration and development wells; connected 225 wells; and achieved net peak production of 141 MBOED, compared with 103MBOED in 2012. We also had 11 operated rigs drilling throughout 2013.
BakkenThe Bakken experienced a significant increase in activity in 2013. We drilled 126 operated wells during the year, of which 85 were brought online. We also increased our operated rig count to 11 and improved our efficiency with pad drilling. As a result, we achieved net peak production of more than 40 MBOED in 2013, compared with approximately 25 MBOED in 2012.
San Juan BasinThe San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 35 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We hold approximately 1.3million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue conventional development opportunities. This also includes approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease rights, where we are advancing the assessment of the Mancos shale play.
Permian Basinthe Permian Basin is another area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology will also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.0million net acres in the Permian, which includes 240,000 net unconventional acres.
Gulf of Mexico At year-end 2013, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:  75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.
15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.
15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.
12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.
Exploration  Conventional Exploration In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we added approximately 430,000 net acres to our position in 2013, bringing our total acreage position to 2.1million acres at December31, 2013. Since 2011, we have nearly doubled our acreage footprint in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and currently rank in the top five deepwater leaseholders. In 2013, we announced two new oil discoveries in the deepwater Lower Tertiary play at Coronado and Gila, adding to the existing Shenandoah and Tiber discoveries made in 2009.
We own a 30 percent working interest in the Shenandoah discovery. The results of the Shenandoah appraisal well were announced in 2013 and confirmed Shenandoah as a significant oil discovery. The well encountered more than 1,000 feet of net pay in high-quality, Lower Tertiary-aged reservoirs. We plan to participate in further appraisal of Shenandoah in 2014. The Coronado exploration well encountered more than 400 feet of net pay and will require further appraisal. We hold a 35 percent working interest in Coronado. In 2013, we acquired a 20 percent interest in the Gila Prospect, located 8 Table of Contents in the Keathley Canyon section of the Gulf of Mexico. The Gila exploration well was announced as a discovery in 2013 and is expected to be appraised in 2014.
Ongoing drilling activities at the end of 2013 included a Tiber appraisal well, in which we own an 18percent working interest, a Coronado appraisal well and the Deep Nansen exploration well. We hold a 12.5 percent interest in the Deep Nansen well. We plan to evaluate the results of these wells in the first half of 2014.
The nonoperated Ardennes wildcat well and the ConocoPhillips-operated Thorn wildcat well were declared dry holes in 2013.
In support of our intentions to grow our Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we secured access to two new-build deepwater drillships, which we anticipate will be delivered to the Gulf of Mexico in 2014 and 2015. The drillships will provide rig availability for our operated drilling program.
Unconventional Exploration In 2013, we actively pursued the exploration and appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Eagle Ford in the Western Gulf Basin, the Bakken in the Williston Basin, the Barnett in the Fort Worth Basin, the Niobrara play in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, Wolfcamp and Bone Springs in the Delaware Basin, Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin, and the Mancos in the San Juan Basin. During 2013, we acquired approximately 61,000 net additional acres in various resource plays across the Lower 48, which included the Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Permian plays, further expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays to approximately 2.7million net acres.
During 2013, we drilled a total of 25 unconventional wells in the Niobrara, Bone Springs and Wolfcamp plays. In 2014, we will continue to actively explore and appraise unconventional plays in the Lower 48, with a focus on Bone Springs, Wolfcamp and Niobrara. We will also continue to assess new opportunities in unconventional plays.
Facilities Freeport LNG Terminal We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeports 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. In July 2013, we agreed with Freeport LNG to terminate this agreement, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant.Upon satisfaction of these conditions, currently expected to occur in the second half of 2014, we will pay Freeport LNG a termination fee of approximately $600 million.Freeport LNG will repay the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, will result in a one-time net cash outflow of approximately $80 million for us.When the agreement becomes effective, we also expect to recognize an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $540 million.At that time, our terminal regasification capacity will be reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4billion cubic feet per day, until July1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60million per year in operating costs over the next 19years. For additional information, see Note 4Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Golden Pass LNG Terminal We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatargas 3 and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets; therefore, our near-to-mid-term utilization of the terminal is expected to be limited.

23 Table of Contents OTHER Marketing Activities Our Commercial organization manages our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. In marketing our production, we attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit-risk exposure. Commodity sales are generally made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase third-party volumes to better position the Company to fully utilize transportation and storage capacity and satisfy customer demand.
Natural Gas Our natural gas production, along with third-party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Our natural gas is sold to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large industrials; independent, integrated or state-owned oil and gas companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market exposure and credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs.
Crude Oil, Bitumen and Natural Gas Liquids Our crude oil, bitumen and natural gas liquids revenues are derived from production in the United States, Canada, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe. These commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation.
Energy Partnerships Marine Well Containment Company We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010, which provides well containment equipment and technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed an interim containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To advance this capability, MWCC continues to develop an expanded containment system with significantly increased capacity. The expanded containment system should be available by the end of 2014.
Subsea Well Response Project In 2011, we, along with several leading oil and gas companies, launched the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP), a non-profit organization based in Stavanger, Norway, which was created to enhance the industrys capability to respond to international subsea well control incidents. Through collaboration with Oil Spill Response Limited, a non-profit organization in the United Kingdom, subsea well intervention equipment is available for the industry to use in the event of a subsea well incident. This complements the work being undertaken in the United States by MWCC.
Technology Our Technology organization has several technology programs, which focus on areas to support our business growth plans: developing unconventional reservoirs, producing oil sands and heavy oil economically with fewer emissions, advancing our competitiveness in deepwater development capabilities, improving the economic efficiency of our LNG and other gas solutions technologies, increasing recoveries from our legacy fields, and implementing sustainability measures.
Our Optimized Cascade  LNG liquefaction technology business continues to grow with the demand for new LNG plants. The technology has been applied in 10 LNG trains around the world, with 12 more under construction and several feasibility studies ongoing.
24 Table of Contents RESERVES We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our estimated total proved reserves at December31, 2013. No difference exists between our estimated total proved reserves for year-end 2012 and year-end 2011, which are shown in this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2013.
DELIVERY COMMITMENTS We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, including approximately 600 billioncubic feet related to the noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and 200million barrels of crude oil in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2028. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we anticipate using proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases to fulfill any remaining commitments. See the disclosure on Proved Undeveloped Reserves in the Oil and Gas Operations section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the development of proved undeveloped reserves.
COMPETITION We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the E&P business. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive, with no single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominating.
We compete with numerous other companies in the industry, including state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on statistics published in the September2, 2013, issue of the Oil and Gas Journal , we had the third-largest worldwide liquids and natural gas reserves for U.S.-based oil and gas companies in 2012. We deliver our production into the worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and safely operating oil and gas producing properties.
GENERAL At the end of 2013, we held a total of 811 active patents in 55 countries worldwide, including 336 active U.S. patents. During 2013, we received 40 patents in the United States and 50 foreign patents. Our products and processes generated licensing revenues of $128 million in 2013. The overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings were $258 million, $221million and $193million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Health, Safety and Environment Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure world class health, safety and environmental performance. The framework through which we safely manage our operations, the HSE Management System Standard, emphasizes process safety, risk management, emergency preparedness and environmental performance, with an intense focus on occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, our HSE Excellence Process requires the business 25 Table of Contents units to measure performance and drive continuous improvement. Assessments are conducted annually to capture progress and set new targets. We also have detailed processes in place to address sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as well as social and stakeholder issues.

Website Access to SEC Reports Our internet website address is www.conocophillips.com . Information contained on our internet website is not part of this report on Form 10-K.
Our Annual Reports on Form10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q, Current Reports on Form8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Alternatively, you may access these reports at the SECs website at www.sec.gov .
26 Table of Contents Item1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.
Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.
Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows and may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce economically.
Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.
The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations.
Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.
Our proved reserve information included in this annual report has been derived from engineering estimates prepared by our personnel. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any significant future price changes could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported.
We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.
Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:  The discharge of pollutants into the environment.
Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and mercury and greenhouse gas emissions.
Carbon taxes.
The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
27 Table of Contents  The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.
Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and shale plays.
We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
Although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earths climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall.
In addition, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, the United States, as well as other countries where we do business, may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreign governments, through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. In certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on our operations; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries. U.S. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory agencies initiatives regarding the hydraulic fracturing process could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of our oil and gas wells.
The U.S. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future. Changes in domestic and international regulations may affect our ability to obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and development of wells or for construction of LNG terminals or regasification facilities in various locations.
Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 54 percent of our hydrocarbon production from continuing operations was derived from production outside the United States in 2013, and 56 percent of our proved reserves, as of December31, 2013, was located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, natural gas liquids or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations.
Changes in governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, and natural gas liquids.
Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, natural gas, bitumen and natural gas liquids wells below actual production capacity. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.
28 Table of Contents Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture partners. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
We do not insure against all potential losses; therefore, we could be harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.
We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. As such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.
The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, civil unrest or cyber attacks. Our operations may be adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving infrastructure required to process or transport our production, such as pipelines, railcars, tankers, barges or other infrastructure. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation.
Our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cybersecurity breaches. Although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, none of these breaches have had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations disrupted.
Item1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
Item3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as matters previously reported in our 2012 Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2013 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2013. Material developments to the previously reported matters have been included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were to be decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to the SEC regulations.
29 Table of Contents On April30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. In connection with the separation, we entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement, which provides for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and us and established procedures for handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters, such as legal proceedings. We have included matters where we remain a party to a proceeding relating to Phillips 66, in accordance with SEC regulations. We do not expect any of those matters to result in a net claim against us.
Matters Previously Reported  ConocoPhillips The New Mexico Environment Department has issued 4 Notices of Violation (NOVs) to ConocoPhillips alleging a total of 16 individual violations for failure to comply with air emission recordkeeping, reporting and testing requirements at various natural gas compression operations in northwestern New Mexico. These violations are alleged to have occurred between 2006 and 2012. The agency is seeking a penalty of over $100,000. We are working with the agency to resolve these matters.
Matters Previously Reported  Phillips 66 In October 2007, ConocoPhillips received a Complaint from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water Act related to a 2006 oil spill at the Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000.
On May19, 2010, the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) alleging various violations of applicable air emission regulations, as well as certain provisions of the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-01-4430.
In October 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the Attorney General of the State of California that it was conducting an investigation into possible violations of the regulations relating to the operation of underground storage tanks at gas stations in California. On January3, 2013, the California Attorney General filed a lawsuit notice that alleges such violations.
On March7, 2012, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (District) in California issued a $302,500 demand to settle five NOVs issued between 2008 and 2010. The NOVs allege non-compliance with the District rules and/or facility permit conditions at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.
On September19, 2012, the District issued a $213,500 demand to settle 14 NOVs issued in 2009 and 2010 with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.
On October15, 2012, the District issued a $313,000 demand to settle 13 other NOVs issued in 2010 and 2011 with respect to alleged violations of regulatory and/or permit requirements at the Phillips 66 Rodeo Refinery.
In May 2012, the Illinois Attorney Generals office filed and notified ConocoPhillips of a complaint with respect to operations at the Phillips 66 Wood River Refinery alleging violations of the Illinois groundwater standards and a third-partys hazardous waste permit. The complaint seeks as relief remediation of area groundwater; compliance with the hazardous waste permit; enhanced pipeline and tank integrity measures; additional spill reporting; and yet-to-be specified amounts for fines and penalties.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is the worlds largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 27 countries. At December31, 2013, we had approximately 18,400employees worldwide and total assets of $118 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP.
Discontinued Operations On April30, 2012, we completed the separation of our downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Our refining, marketing and transportation businesses, most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business), were transferred to Phillips 66. As a part of our asset disposition program, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and the sale of our Algeria business, and we have agreements to sell our Nigeria business. Results of operations related to Phillips 66, Kashagan, Algeria and Nigeria have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, see Note3Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Overview We are an independent E&P company focused on exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas globally. Our asset base reflects our legacy as a major company with a strategic focus on higher-margin developments. Our diverse portfolio includes resource-rich North American shale and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and a growing inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. Our value proposition to our shareholders is to deliver production and cash margin growth, competitive returns on capital, and a compelling dividend, while keeping our fundamental commitment to safety, operating excellence and environmental stewardship. We expect to achieve this value proposition through optimizing our portfolio, investing in high-margin developments, applying technical capability and maintaining financial flexibility.
35 Table of Contents We achieved several strategic milestones in 2013. We delivered on our non-core asset sales, advanced our growth programs, achieved exploration success and increased shareholder distributions. These accomplishments will position us to meet our goal of 3 to 5 percent annual production and margin growth beginning in 2014.
During 2013, we generated $15.8 billion in cash from continuing operations, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.3 billion and generated $10.2 billion in proceeds from dispositions of non-core assets. This brings the total proceeds received to $12.4 billion for the 20122013 program, which has exceeded our goal of raising $8$10 billion in proceeds from disposition of non-strategic assets during 2012 and 2013. Consistent with our commitment to offer our shareholders a compelling dividend, in July 2013, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 4.5 percent to $0.69 per share.
In 2013, we achieved production of 1,545thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), including production from discontinued operations of 43 MBOED. With the startup of major projects at Christina Lake Phase E, Ekofisk South and Jasmine in 2013, final preparations underway for full-field startup at Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai, and a portfolio of high-margin opportunities, we have the momentum to begin delivering our volume growth goals in 2014.
We funded a $16.9 billion capital program in 2013 and fully prepaid a $2.8 billion joint venture acquisition obligation to our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership. Our 2013 capital program yielded a strong organic reserve replacement, as our annual organic reserve replacement ratio was 179 percent. The organic reserve additions represent a continuing portfolio shift to higher-value liquids and reflect increased levels of activity in our development programs and major projects.
Our 2014 capital budget of $16.7 billion will target our diverse portfolio of global opportunities, with approximately 55 percent of the budget allocated toward North America and 45 percent toward Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. Our investments will be directed predominantly toward high-quality developments already underway in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia and Australia, as well as exploration opportunities which will continue to build our inventory for the future.
Key Operating and Financial Highlights Significant highlights during 2013 included the following:  Achieved annual organic reserve replacement of 179 percent from reserve additions of approximately 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Achieved annual production of 1,545 MBOED, including continuing operations of 1,502 MBOED and discontinued operations of 43 MBOED, and generated earnings of $8.0 billion.
Increased quarterly dividend by 4.5 percent.
Generated $10.2 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions.
Announced two deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries at Coronado and Gila, adding to the existing Shenandoah and Tiber discoveries in 2009.
Eagle Ford and Bakken production increased 60 percent in 2013 compared with 2012.
Commenced production from major projects at Christina Lake Phase E, Ekofisk South and Jasmine, with preparations underway for full-field startup at Gumusut and Siakap North-Petai in 2014.
Business Environment The business environment for the energy industry has historically experienced many challenges which have influenced our operations and profitability, largely due to factors beyond our control, such as the global financial crisis and recession which began in 2008; supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts; environmental laws; tax regulations; governmental policies; and weather-related disruptions. Recently, North Americas energy landscape has been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of 36 Table of Contents supply, as a result of advances in technology responsible for the rapid growth of shale production, successful exploration and development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and rising production from the Canadian oil sands. These dynamics generally influence world energy markets and commodity prices. The most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of our operating cash flows into our business is commodity prices, which can be very volatile; therefore, our strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a diverse portfolio of assets, which we believe will provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycles.
Operating and Financial Priorities Important factors we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include:  Maintaining a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship.
Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth. Our sustainability efforts in 2013 focused on updating action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights, as well as revamping public reporting to be more informative, searchable and responsive to common questions.
There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010 to improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. MWCC developed a containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, which enhances the oil industrys ability to respond to subsea well-control incidents in international waters.
Adding to our proved reserve base.
We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.
o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
o Acquisition of existing fields.
Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in adding to our proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December31, 2013, our organic reserve replacement was 145percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of sales and purchases.
Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
Disciplined investment approach.
We participate in a capital-intensive industry. As a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. We use a disciplined approach to select the appropriate projects which will provide the most attractive investment opportunities, with a continued focus on organic growth in volumes and margins through higher-margin oil, condensate and LNG projects and limited investment in North American 37 Table of Contents conventional natural gas. As investments bring more liquids production online, we expect a corresponding shift in our production mix. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment decision to the time the asset is operational and generates financial returns.
Our actual capital program for 2013 was $16.9 billion, excluding a $2.8 billion prepayment to FCCL for the remaining balance of our joint venture acquisition obligation. Our capital budget for 2014 is $16.7 billion. Approximately 13 percent of the 2014 capital budget is allocated toward maintenance of our legacy base portfolio, including planned turnarounds; 39 percent is allocated to high-margin development drilling programs, mostly in North America, which is intended to offset natural field decline from our producing assets; 35 percent is focused on sanctioned major developments, such as Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) and Surmont Phase 2; and 13 percent is planned for our worldwide exploration and appraisal program, which will target both conventional and unconventional plays.
Portfolio optimization.
We continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on assets which offer the highest returns and growth potential, while selling nonstrategic holdings. In 2012, we announced plans to sell $8$10 billion of noncore assets through the end of 2013. During 2013, we received proceeds from dispositions of approximately $10.2 billion, which primarily resulted from: o The disposition of our 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan, located in Kazakhstan.
o The sale of our Algeria business.
o The sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in North Dakota and Montana.
o The sale of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, located in Canada.
o The disposition of our 39 percent equity investment in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, located in Trinidad and Tobago.
o The disposition of a portion of our working interests in the Poseidon discovery in the Browse Basin and the Goldwyer Shale in the Canning Basin.
o The disposition of certain properties located in southwest Louisiana.
o The sale of our 10 percent interest in the Interconnector Pipeline, located in Europe.
As previously announced, we entered into agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. The upstream sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2014 and generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments. We have received deposits to date of $500 million, with the remainder of approximately $1.0 billion due at closing. The buyer has until March31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of Brass LNG would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments.
During 2012, we received proceeds of $2.1 billion from the sale of our Vietnam business, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, our investment in Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) in Russia, and the additional dilution of our interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent.
Although we are near completion of the 20122013 asset disposition program, we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic direction. We will prune the portfolio as necessary and direct our capital investments to areas which will achieve our strategic objectives.
Controlling costs and expenses.
Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. As managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industry, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 4 percent in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily as a result of higher operating expenses in the Lower 48 associated with increased production.
38 Table of Contents  Applying technical capability . We focus on ways to leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans. Technical strength is part of our heritage, and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practices where they matter most. In 2013, we tested new technology as a means to provide remote monitoring capability, as well as new methods that could increase production and reduce water usage and emissions from assets, such as the oil sands and unconventional reservoirs. Companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across all of our operations. Such innovations enable us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact.
Developing and retaining a talented work force.
We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. As part of our future workforce planning, we are committed to increasing student interest in energy industry professions by awarding scholarships in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, accounting and finance, as well as providing university internships to attract the best talent. We also recruit experienced hires to maintain a broad range of skills and experience. Career development is an important investment in our employees and our future, so we focus on continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to accelerate technical and functional skills of our employees.
Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:  Commodity prices.
Our earnings generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. The following table depicts the average benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, Dated Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas: Dollars Per Unit 2013 2012 2011 Market Indicators WTI (per barrel) $ 97.90 94.16 95.05 Dated Brent (per barrel) 108.65 111.58 111.27 U.S. Henry Hub first of month (per million British thermal units) 3.65 2.79 4.04 Brent crude oil prices decreased 3 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, to average $108.65 per barrel, as disruptions to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) supplies were more than offset by non-OPEC production growth. Global oil demand grew 1 percent, or about 1.2million barrels per day, to 91.2million barrels per day. The fiscal uncertainties that plagued many developed countries, while not completely resolved, subsided enough to help restore confidence and growth in real economic activity in 2013.
WTI crude oil prices increased 4 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, as new infrastructure helped to alleviate the glut at Cushing, Oklahoma, by increasing the movement of physical barrels toward U.S. Gulf Coast refining centers. As a result, the WTI discount to Brent decreased by 38 percent to average $10.75. U.S. crude oil production grew 16 percent to reach an average of 7.5million barrels per day. The growth was led by shale oil developments such as Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian. U.S. oil demand increased by 2 percent in 2013, as economic growth strengthened.
Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 31 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Strong weather-driven demand growth outweighed production growth and drew down high storage inventories. U.S. natural gas consumption rose 2 percent, or 1.5 billion cubic feet per day, to an all-time high of 39 Table of Contents 71.2billion cubic feet per day. U.S. dry gas production increased 1 percent, by 0.8 billion cubic feet per day, to reach 66.5 billion cubic feet per day, as growth from the Marcellus shale gas play more than offset declines in other areas.
The expansion in shale production has also helped boost supplies of natural gas liquids, resulting in downward pressure on natural gas liquids prices in the United States. As a result, our domestic realized natural gas liquids price declined 11 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Our realized bitumen price remained relatively flat in 2013.
In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing significant short- and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible.
Impairments.
As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our properties, plants and equipment and investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2013 totaled $0.5 billion and mainly resulted from impairments of various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Before-tax impairments in 2012 totaled $1.2 billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated leaseholds in Canada; Cedar Creek Anticline in the Lower 48; various properties in Europe, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives; and the N Block in the Caspian Sea. For additional information, see Note 9Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective tax rate.
Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations.
Fiscal and regulatory environment.
Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports have been suspended since July 2013 due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and they were also suspended in 2011 during Libyas period of civil unrest. In the United Kingdom, the government enacted tax legislation in both 2012 and 2011, which increased our U.K. corporate tax rate. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries.
40 Table of Contents Outlook Due to the ongoing shutdown of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, we intend to exclude Libya from our future production outlooks. Production from continuing operations for 2013 was 1,502 MBOED, or 1,472 MBOED adjusted for Libya. Full-year 2014 production from continuing operations is expected to be approximately 1,550 MBOED, excluding Libya. First-quarter 2014 production from continuing operations is expected to be 1,490 to 1,530 MBOED, excluding Libya. Our Corporate and Other segment earnings are expected to be an after-tax loss of approximately $1.0 billion for the full-year 2014.
Freeport LNG Terminal We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeports 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. In July 2013, we agreed with Freeport LNG to terminate this agreement, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant.Upon satisfaction of these conditions, currently expected to occur in the second half of 2014, we will pay Freeport LNG a termination fee of approximately $600 million.Freeport LNG will repay the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. These transactions, plus miscellaneous items, will result in a one-time net cash outflow of approximately $80 million for us.When the agreement becomes effective, we also expect to recognize an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $540 million.At that time, our terminal regasification capacity will be reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4billion cubic feet per day, until July1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60million per year in operating costs over the next 19years. For additional information, see Note 4Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating Segments We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
The LUKOIL Investment segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, which was sold in the first quarter of 2011.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs related to the separation and certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues received.
Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our continuing operations, including commodity prices and production.
41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results A summary of the companys income (loss) from continuing operations by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Years Ended December31 2013 2012 2011 Alaska $ 2,274 2,276 1,984 Lower 48 and Latin America 1,081 1,029 1,288 Canada 718 (684 ) 91 Europe 1,199 1,498 1,830 Asia Pacific and Middle East 3,591 3,996 3,093 Other International (6 ) 359 (377) LUKOIL Investment - - 239 Corporate and Other (820 ) (993 ) (960) Income from continuing operations $ 8,037 7,481 7,188 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 7 percent in 2013. The increase was mainly due to:  Lower impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2013 totaled $289 million after-tax, compared with $900 million after-tax in 2012.
Higher natural gas prices.
A higher proportion of production in higher-margin areas and a continued portfolio shift toward liquids.
Lower production taxes, primarily as a result of lower production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska.
These items were partially offset by:  Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses, mainly due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and China.
Lower gains from asset sales. In 2013, gains from asset dispositions were $1,132 million after-tax, compared with gains of $1,567 million after-tax in 2012.
Higher operating expenses.
Lower crude oil and natural gas liquids prices.
42 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings for ConocoPhillips increased 4 percent in 2012. The increase was mainly due to:  Higher gains from asset sales. In 2012, gains from asset dispositions were $1,567 million after-tax, compared with gains in 2011 from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales of $141 million after-tax.
Higher LNG and crude oil prices.
Lower production taxes, mainly as a result of lower volumes.
The benefit from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million.
The favorable resolution of pending claims and settlements of $235 million after-tax.
These items were partially offset by:  Lower volumes, largely due to dispositions and reduced production in China.
Lower natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen prices.
Higher operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which included pension settlement expenses of $87 million after-tax and separation costs of $84 million after-tax.
Higher impairments. Non-cash impairments in 2012 totaled $900 million after-tax, compared with impairments in 2011 of $698 million after-tax.
43 Table of Contents Income Statement Analysis 2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower natural gas volumes and lower crude oil prices, partly offset by higher natural gas prices.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 16 percent in 2013. The increase primarily resulted from higher earnings from FCCL Partnership, mainly as a result of higher bitumen volumes.
Gain on dispositions decreased 25 percent in 2013. For additional information, see Note 6Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other income decreased 20 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of the 2012 benefit which resulted from the favorable resolution of the Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration. The decrease was partly offset by a $150 million insurance settlement in 2013 associated with the Bohai Bay seepage incidents. For information on a separate PDVSA arbitration with the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), see Note14Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Purchased commodities decreased 10 percent in 2013, largely as a result of lower purchased natural gas volumes, partly offset by higher natural gas prices.
Production and operating expenses increased 7 percent in 2013, primarily due to increased drilling activity and production volumes, mostly in the Lower 48, in addition to a charge related to a settlement in Asia Pacific and Middle East. These increases were partly offset by the reduction of an accrual related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval of cost allocation (pooling) agreements with the remaining owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).
SG&A expenses decreased 23 percent in 2013, primarily due to the absence of separation costs, lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. For additional information on pension settlement expense, see Note 19Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Exploration expenses decreased 18 percent in 2013, largely due to lower leasehold impairment costs. Exploration costs in 2012 included the $481 million impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, as a result of the indefinite suspension of the project. Increased 2013 exploration activity and higher dry hole costs, mostly in the Lower 48, partly offset the reduction.
DD&A increased 13 percent in 2013. The increase was mostly associated with higher production volumes in the Lower 48. Higher production volumes in China partly contributed to the increase.
Impairments decreased 22 percent in 2013. Impairments in 2013 mainly consisted of increases in the asset retirement obligation (ARO) for properties located in the United Kingdom, which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives, and mature natural gas properties in Canada. Impairments in 2012 consisted of impairments of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline and impairments of late-life U.K. properties. For additional information, see Note 9Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Taxes other than income taxes decreased 19 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes and prices, and higher capital spending in Alaska.
Interest and debt expense decreased 14 percent in 2013, mostly as a result of lower interest expense from lower average debt levels.
44 Table of Contents See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.
2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 10 percent in 2012, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partly offset by higher LNG prices.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 54 percent in 2012. The increase primarily resulted from:  Improved earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3)(QG3), mainly due to higher LNG prices, partly offset by lower volumes.
Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment.
Gain on dispositions increased $1,287 million in 2012. Gains in 2012 primarily resulted from the disposition of our Vietnam business, our equity investment in NMNG and the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, partly offset by the loss on further dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. Gains in 2011 mainly consisted of the divestiture of our remaining LUKOIL shares and the disposition of certain properties located in the Lower 48 and Canada, partially offset by the loss on the initial dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent.
Other income increased 78 percent in 2012, mostly as a result of the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration.
Purchased commodities decreased 15 percent in 2012, largely as a result of lower U.S. natural gas prices, partly offset by higher purchased volumes.
Production and operating expenses increased 6 percent in 2012, mostly due to major turnaround expenses at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility and higher operating expenses in the Lower 48.
SG&A expenses increased 28 percent in 2012, primarily due to pension settlement expense and costs associated with the separation of Phillips 66.
Exploration expenses increased 45 percent in 2012, mostly due to the Mackenzie Gas Project impairment.
Impairments increased 112 percent in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included the impairment of capitalized development costs associated with the Mackenzie Gas Project, the disposition of Cedar Creek Anticline, and impairments of various late-life properties, mostly located in the United Kingdom. Impairments in 2011 consisted of various North American natural gas properties.
Taxes other than income taxes decreased 11 percent in 2012, mostly due to lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes.
Interest and debt expense decreased 26 percent in 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest on projects and lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels.

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December31, 2013, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Qatar, Libya and Russia.
In 2013, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2012, mainly due to normal field decline, asset dispositions, shut-in Libya production, due to the closure of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal, and higher unplanned downtime. These decreases were partially offset by new production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48, the ramp-up of production from new phases at Christina Lake in Canada, and early production in Malaysia; higher production in China; and increased conventional drilling and well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway. Adjusted for dispositions, downtime and the impact from the closure of the Es Sider Terminal in Libya, production grew by 30 MBOED, or 2 percent, compared with 2012.
In 2012, average production from continuing operations decreased 2 percent compared with 2011, primarily as a result of normal field decline, the impact from asset dispositions and higher planned and unplanned downtime. These decreases were largely offset by additional production from major developments, mainly from shale plays in the Lower 48 and ramp-up of new phases at FCCL, the resumption of production in Libya following a period of civil unrest in 2011, and increased drilling programs in the Lower 48.

In 2013, Alaska contributed 23 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1percent of our natural gas production.
2013 vs. 2012 Alaska earnings in 2013 were flat compared with 2012 earnings. Earnings in 2013 were mainly impacted by lower crude oil volumes and lower crude oil prices. These decreases to earnings were mostly offset by lower production taxes, which resulted from lower prices, higher 2013 capital spending and lower crude oil production volumes. Additionally, 2013 earnings benefitted from the impact of a ruling by the FERC.
In 2012, the major owners of TAPS filed a proposed settlement with FERC to resolve pooling disputes prior to August 2012 and establish a voluntary pooling agreement to pool costs prospectively from August 2012. In July 2013, the FERC approved the proposed settlement and pooling agreement without modification. Under the terms of the agreements, we paid the other remaining owners of TAPS $355 million, including interest, in the third quarter of 2013. As a result of FERC approval of these agreements, we reduced a related accrual in the second quarter of 2013, which decreased our production and operating expenses by $97 million after-tax. The FERC ruling approving these agreements has been appealed by certain parties to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Production averaged 200 MBOED in 2013, a decrease of 6 percent compared with 2012. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower planned downtime.
2012 vs. 2011 Alaska earnings in 2012 increased 15 percent compared with earnings in 2011. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices, lower production taxes as a result of lower crude oil production volumes, the absence of the $54 million after-tax write-off of our investment associated with the cancellation of the Denali gas pipeline project in 2011, and lower DD&A. These increases were partly offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher operating expenses.
Production averaged 213 MBOED in 2012, a decrease of 5 percent compared with 2011. This decrease was mainly due to normal field decline, partially offset by lower unplanned downtime.

The Lower 48 and Latin America segment primarily consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states, as well as exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia.
2013 vs. 2012 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings increased 5 percent in 2013 compared with 2012. Earnings in 2013 largely benefitted from higher crude oil and NGL volumes, higher gains from asset dispositions, mostly as a result of the $288 million after-tax gain on disposition of our equity investment in Phoenix Park, higher natural gas and crude oil prices and lower impairments. These increases were partially offset by higher DD&A, as a result of higher crude oil production, as well as the absence of the 2012 realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million and the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration, as more fully described below. Higher operating expenses, higher exploration expenses, which mainly resulted from the Thorn and Ardennes dry holes in the Gulf of Mexico, and lower NGL prices also partially offset the increase in 2013 earnings. For additional information on asset sales, see Note6Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2012, based on an ICC arbitration tribunal ruling, PDVSA paid ConocoPhillips $68 million for pre-expropriation breaches of the Petrozuata project agreements, which resulted in a $61 million after-tax earnings increase. The Company also recognized additional income of $173 million after-tax associated with the reversal of a related contingent liability accrual. These amounts included interest of $33 million after-tax, which was reflected in the Corporate and Other segment. For information on a separate PDVSA ICSID arbitration, see Note 14Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Average production in the Lower 48 increased 7 percent in 2013, while average crude oil production increased 24 percent in the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Bakken areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline and the impact from dispositions.
2012 vs. 2011 Lower 48 and Latin America earnings decreased 20percent in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily the result of substantially lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices; higher DD&A, mostly due to higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production; lower gains from asset dispositions; higher operating expenses and higher impairments. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil 48 Table of Contents and natural gas liquids volumes. Earnings in 2012 also benefitted from the realization of a tax loss carryforward of $236 million, and the favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration.
Average production increased 7 percent in 2012, while average crude oil production increased 31 percent over the same period. New production, primarily from the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian areas, and improved drilling and well performance more than offset normal field decline. In addition, higher unplanned downtime during 2012 partly offset the increase in production.

In 2013, Canada contributed 17 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 20 percent of our natural gas production.
2013 vs. 2012 Canada operations reported earnings of $718 million in 2013, an increase of $1,402 million, compared with a loss of $684 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 earnings was largely due to:  The $461 million after-tax gain on disposition of our Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold.
Lower impairments. Impairments in 2013 consisted of the $162 million after-tax impairment of mature natural gas assets in western Canada. Impairments in 2012 mainly resulted from the $520million after-tax impairment of the Mackenzie Gas Project and associated undeveloped leaseholds.
Higher bitumen volumes, primarily at Christina Lake.
The recognition of additional income of $224 million related to the favorable tax resolution associated with the sale of certain western Canada properties in a prior year.

Average production in Canada increased 1 percent in 2013, while average liquids production increased 13percent in the same period, primarily from the oil sands. Normal field decline was more than offset by the ramp-up of production from Christina Lake Phases D and E in FCCL and improved drilling and well performance from western Canada.
2012 vs. 2011 Canada operations reported a loss of $684 million in 2012, a reduction of $775 million, compared with earnings of $91 million in 2011. The decrease in earnings was largely due to significantly lower natural gas prices, lower bitumen prices and higher impairments, mainly as a result of the Mackenzie Gas Project impairment in 2012.These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher bitumen volumes from FCCL and lower DD&A from our western Canadian gas assets, primarily due to asset dispositions and curtailments.Equity earnings from FCCL were also impacted by higher operating and DD&A expenses, mostly as a result of higher production volumes.
Average production in Canada increased 5 percent in 2012, while average liquids production increased 24percent over the same period. Normal field decline and the impact from asset dispositions were more than offset by new production from Christina Lake Phases C and D and improved well performance from Foster Creek in FCCL.

In 2013, our Europe operations contributed 14percent of our worldwide liquids production and 11 percent of our natural gas production.
2013 vs. 2012 Europe operations reported a 20 percent decrease in 2013 earnings compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes and lower gains from asset dispositions. Gains realized in 2012 included the $287 million after-tax gain on sale of our interests in the Statfjord and Alba fields, compared with the $83 million after-tax gain on sale of our interest in the Interconnector Pipeline in 2013. These decreases were partly offset by the absence of 50 Table of Contents the recognition of $170 million in additional income tax expense in 2012, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom, which restricted corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent. The additional tax expense resulted from the revaluation of deferred tax balances.
Average production decreased 17 percent in 2013, primarily due to normal field decline. Major planned maintenance at Greater Ekofisk, higher unplanned downtime, mostly in the East Irish Sea, and asset dispositions also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by improved drilling and well performance in Norway and new production from Jasmine and Ekofisk South.
2012 vs. 2011 Earnings from Europe decreased 18 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly as a result of lower volumes, higher impairments and the U.K. tax increase. These decreases to earnings were partly offset by the gain on disposition of Statfjord and Alba and lower DD&A. Additionally, earnings in 2011 included a $316 million increase in U.K. corporate income tax expense due to legislation enacted in 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106 million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March24, 2011, through December31, 2011.
Production decreased 18 percent in 2012, mostly due to normal field decline, dispositions and higher unplanned downtime in the United Kingdom.

Average production increased 4 percent in 2013. The improvement was largely due to:  Increased production in Bohai Bay, China.
New production from Panyu in the South China Sea.
The continued ramp-up of production in Malaysia.
Lower planned downtime, mainly from our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG facility.
These increases were partly offset by normal field decline and the Vietnam disposition.
2012 vs. 2011 Asia Pacific and Middle East earnings increased 29 percent in 2012 compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from higher gains from asset dispositions, significantly higher LNG prices, higher equity earnings due to lower DD&A and operating expenses from QG3, and lower Bohai Bay expenses incurred in 2012. Amounts realized from dispositions in 2012 consisted of the Vietnam gain and the APLNG loss on further dilution from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent, compared with a $279 million after-tax loss on the initial dilution of our interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent in 2011. The increase in 2012 earnings was partly offset by lower crude oil volumes, mainly as a result of the Bohai Bay seepage incidents and the Vietnam disposition, lower LNG volumes and higher production taxes.
Average production decreased 10 percent in 2012. The decrease was largely due to the disposition of our Vietnam business, normal field decline, planned maintenance at our Bayu-Undan Field and Darwin LNG Facility in 2012, as well as lower production in China.

2013 vs. 2012 Other International operations reported a loss of $6 million in 2013, compared with earnings of $359 million in 2012. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to the absence of the $443 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. Lower volumes from Libya also contributed to the reduction. These decreases were partially offset by lower impairments. Earnings in 2012 included a $108 million after-tax impairment associated with the N Block in the Caspian Sea.
Average production decreased 39 percent in 2013, largely as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal in Libya at the end of July 2013 and the disposition of our interest in NMNG in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by higher production from Libya during the first six months of 2013, compared with the ramp-up of production in 2012 following their period of civil unrest. Libya production remains shut-in, as the Es Sider Terminal closure has continued into the first quarter of 2014.
2012 vs. 2011 Other International earnings were $359 million in 2012, a $736 million increase compared with 2011. Earnings in 2012 primarily benefitted from the NMNG disposition, the absence of a $395 million after-tax impairment of our investment in NMNG in 2011, and higher earnings from Libya, as a result of the resumption of production following a period of civil unrest in 2011. These increases were partially offset by the N Block impairment.
Average production increased 51 percent in 2012, mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by field decline in Russia and the disposition of our interest in NMNG.

Net interest decreased 18 percent in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to the absence of a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement in 2012 and lower interest expense on lower average debt levels. These improvements were partially offset by the absence of the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the 2012 favorable resolution of the PDVSA ICC arbitration. For additional information on the ICC arbitration, see the Results of Operations for Lower 48 and Latin America.
Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 32 percent in 2013, mainly due to lower pension settlement expense and lower costs related to compensation and benefit plans. Pension settlement expense incurred in 2013 was $41 million after-tax, compared with $87 million after-tax in 2012.
Technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues received. Activities are focused on heavy oil and oil sands; unconventional reservoirs; subsurface technology; liquefied natural gas; and arctic, deepwater and sustainability technology.
Separation costs consist of expenses related to the separation of our Downstream business into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66.
55 Table of Contents The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Other expenses increased $127 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher tax-related adjustments, the absence of a $39 million after-tax settlement which benefitted 2012 and higher foreign currency transaction losses.
2012 vs. 2011 Net interest decreased 9 percent in 2012 compared with 2011, mostly due to higher capitalized interest, lower interest expense due to lower average debt levels, higher interest income and the $33 million after-tax interest benefit from the favorable resolution of the PDVSA arbitration. These improvements were partly offset by a $68 million after-tax premium on early debt retirement.
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 65 percent in 2012, mainly due to $87 million of after-tax pension settlement expense and higher costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
Technology reported a loss of $4million in 2012, compared to earnings of $15 million in 2011, primarily as a result of lower licensing revenues.
Separation costs increased $59 million in 2012 and mainly included costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
The improvement in Other in 2012 was largely due to various tax-related adjustments, including a $39million after-tax settlement. These improvements were partially offset by higher environmental expenses and foreign currency transaction losses.
56 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Financial Indicators Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 15,801 13,458 13,953 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 286 464 5,693 Cash and cash equivalents 6,246 3,618 5,780 Short-term debt 589 955 1,013 Total debt 21,662 21,725 22,623 Total equity 52,492 48,427 65,749 Percent of total debt to capital* 29 % 31 26 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt** 8 % 9 10 * Capital includes total debt and total equity.
** Includes effect of interest rate swaps.
To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from continuing operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2013, we received $10,220 million in proceeds from asset sales. We used the remaining $748million of our restricted cash balance, received in connection with the separation of Phillips 66, solely to pay dividends. During 2013, the primary uses of our available cash were $15,537million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments; $3,334 million to pay dividends on our common stock; $2,810 million to prepay the remaining balance of our joint venture acquisition obligation with our 50 percent owned FCCL Partnership; and $946million to repay debt. During 2013, cash and cash equivalents increased by $2,628million, to $6,246million.
In addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe our current cash balance and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital expenditures and investments, dividend payments and required debt payments.
Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2013, cash provided by continuing operating activities was $15,801 million, a 17 percent increase from 2012. The increase was primarily related to lower income taxes due to a greater proportion of volumes in areas with more favorable fiscal regimes. During 2012, cash provided by continuing operations was $13,458million, compared with $13,953 million in 2011.
While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
The level of our production volumes also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and their 57 Table of Contents timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
Our 2013 production from continuing operations averaged 1,502MBOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production from continuing operations in 2014 is expected to be 1,550 MBOED, excluding Libya.
To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2013 was 147 percent. Excluding the impact of sales and purchases, the organic reserve replacement was 179 percent of 2013 production. Over the five-year period ended December31, 2013, our reserve replacement was 69percent (including 95 percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL and the impact of asset dispositions. Excluding these items and purchases, our five-year organic reserve replacement was 145 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report.
As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2013 were $10,220 million, primarily from the sale of our 8.4 percent equity interest in Kashagan, the sale of our Algeria business, the sale of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, the sale of our interest in the Clyden undeveloped oil sands leasehold, the sale of our 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park and the sale of a portion of our working interests in Browse and Canning basins. This compares with proceeds of $2,132million in 2012, primarily from the sale of our Vietnam business, the sale of our equity interest in NMNG and the sale of our interest in the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea.
As previously announced, we entered into agreements to sell our Nigeria business, which includes its upstream affiliates and Brass LNG. The upstream sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2014 and generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments. We have received deposits to date of $500 million, with the remainder of approximately $1.0 billion due at closing. The buyer has until March31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of Brass LNG would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize the portfolio.
Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities At December31, 2013, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
58 Table of Contents Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. At both December31, 2013 and 2012, we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paperprogram, there was $961million of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2013, compared with $1,055million at December31, 2012. Since we had $961million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.5billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December31, 2013.
Our senior long-term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility.
Certain of our project-related contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, we had direct bank letters of credit of $827 million and $852 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.
For information about guarantees, see Note 13Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Capital Requirements For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the Capital Spending section.
Our debt balance at both December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, was $21.7 billion. During 2013, we repaid bonds at maturity totaling $850 million. In June 2013, we incurred a capital lease obligation of $906million. For more information, see Note 11Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to our 50percent owned FCCL Partnership. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007. The principal portion of these payments totaled $772 million in 2013. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows.
59 Table of Contents This $2,810 million prepayment substantially increases the FCCL Partnerships ability to make distributions to its partners or fund future capital requirements without contributions from the partners. Interest accrued at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
In July 2013, we announced a 4.5 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to 69 cents per share. Additionally, on February5, 2014, we announced a dividend of 69 cents per share. The dividend will be paid March3, 2014, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February18, 2014.
In February 2014, the $400 million 4.75% Notes due 2014 were repaid at maturity.

Our capital expenditures and investments from continuing operations for the three-year period ended December31, 2013, totaled $40.9billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and developments, primarily:  Oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in the Lower 48, including the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays, and the Permian Basin.
Development of coalbed methane projects associated with the APLNG joint venture in Australia.
In Europe, development activities in the Greater Ekofisk, Jasmine and Clair Ridge areas, and appraisal activities in the Greater Clair Area.
Oil sands development and ongoing liquids-focused plays in Canada.
Alaska activities related to development in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, and the Western North Slope.
Exploration leases and wells in deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Continued development of offshore fields in Malaysia and ongoing exploration and development activity onshore and offshore Indonesia and Australia.
61 Table of Contents 2014 CAPITAL BUDGET Our 2014 capital budget is $16.7 billion, essentially flat compared with our 2013 capital program.
We are directing approximately 55 percent of our 2014 capital expenditures budget for continuing operations to North America. These funds are expected to be directed toward:  Increased investment in the Companys successful development drilling programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian.
Higher allocation of capital to Alaska compared to 2013, reflecting increased spending on the CD5 development and higher activity resulting from improved fiscal terms from the passage of the More Alaska Production Act.
Increased exploration and appraisal activity in several North American unconventional plays, including the Permian, Niobrara, Canol and Duvernay.
Higher levels of spending at Surmont Phase 2, in anticipation of first production in 2015.
Increased conventional exploration drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
We are directing approximately 45 percent of our 2014 capital expenditures budget for continuing operations to Europe, Asia Pacific and other international businesses. These funds are expected to be directed toward:  Peak spending at the APLNG Project, in anticipation of first LNG sales.
Conventional exploration drilling offshore Angola, Senegal and the Browse Basin.
Investments in Eldfisk II, Britannia Long-term Compression and Clair Ridge.
For information on proved undeveloped reserves and the associated costs to develop these reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section.
Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For information on other contingencies, see Note14Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
62 Table of Contents Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:  U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.
U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).
U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.
U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.
U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.
These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise 63 Table of Contents to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States and Canada.
An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December31, 2012, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 11 sites around the United States. At December31, 2013, we had been notified of 4 new sites, bringing the number of unresolved sites with potential liability to 15 sites.
For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
Expensed environmental costs were $546million in 2013 and are expected to be about $580million per year in 2014 and 2015. Capitalized environmental costs were $357 million in 2013 and are expected to be about $480 million per year in 2014 and 2015.
Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, 64 Table of Contents operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or other agency enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.
Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
At December31, 2013, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $348million, compared with $364million at December31, 2012, for remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:  European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2013 was approximately $2 million (net share pre-tax).
A regulation issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity beginning July1, 2007 by 12 percent. New facilities must reduce 2 percent per year until they reach the maximum target of 12 percent. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with these Canadian regulations in 2013 was approximately $6 million.
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act.
The EPAs announcement on March29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPAs and U.S. Department of Transportations joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.
Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon tax legislation in 2013 was approximately $44 million (net share pre-tax).
Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation, which took effect in July 2012. Our cost of compliance with the Australian Clean Energy Legislation in 2013 was approximately $10 million (net share pre-tax).
65 Table of Contents In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:  Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted.
The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).
The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
The GHG reductions required.
The price and availability of offsets.
The amount and allocation of allowances.
Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
The Company has responded by putting in place a corporate Climate Change Action Plan, together with individual business unit climate change management plans in order to undertake actions in four major areas:  Equipping the Company for a low emission world, for example by integrating GHG forecasting and reporting into company procedures; utilizing GHG pricing in planning economics; developing systems to handle GHG market transactions.
Reducing GHG emissionsIn 2012 the Company reduced GHG emissions by approximately 1,000,000 metric tonnes by carrying out a range of programs across a number of business units.
Evaluating business opportunities such as the creation of offsets and allowances; carbon capture and storage; the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technologies.
Engaging externallyThe Company is a sponsor of MITs Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation; and discloses our progress and performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
The Company uses an estimated market cost of GHG emissions in the range of $6 to $46 per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunities.
Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income.
66 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.
Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2013, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,830 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $558 million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 56percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately threeyears. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2014 would increase by approximately $39million. At year-end 2013, the remaining $6,708million of gross capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2014.
Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.
67 Table of Contents If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment.
At year-end 2013, total suspended well costs were $994million, compared with $1,038million at year-end 2012. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income 68 Table of Contents statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&A of the capitalized costsforthat asset. At year-end 2013, the net book value of productive properties, plants and equipment(PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $59billion and the DD&A recorded on these assets in 2013 was approximately $7.0billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2012 and 4.9 billion BOE at the end of 2013. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2013 would have increased by an estimated $370million.
Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 9Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
Investments innonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity methodare reviewed for impairment whenthere is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions.Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair valueless than the investments carrying amount.Whenit is determined such aloss in valueisother than temporary, an impairment charge is recognizedfor the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value.When determiningwhether a decline in value is other than temporary,managementconsiders factorssuch as thelength of time and extent of the decline, the investees financialcondition and near-term prospects,and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in themarket value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affectthe timing and the amount of animpairment of an investmentin any period.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to PP&E at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance 69 Table of Contents considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. These are primarily related to remediation activities required by Canada and various states within the United States at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $120million, while a 1percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components ofannual pension expense and triggeraccelerated recognitionof a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.Thesebenefit payments are based ondecisions by plan participants and aretherefore difficult topredict. See Note 19Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

71 Table of Contents Item7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.
Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Vice President of Commercial, Business Development and Corporate Planning monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.
Commodity Price Risk Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:  Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.
Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities.
We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December31, 2013, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December31, 2013 and 2012, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December31, 2013 and 2012, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.
Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation at year-end 2012 was estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at an effective yield rate of 0.7percent. The discount rate was based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration, adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million.

We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.
73 Table of Contents At December31, 2013 and 2012, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps for purposes of mitigating our cash related exposures. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the related cash balances, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10percent change in the December31, 2013, or 2012, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December31, 2013 and 2012, were as follows: In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* FairMarketValue** 2013 2012 2013 2012 Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD - 2,573 - 31 Buy U.S. dollar, sell euro USD - 7 - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Norwegian krone USD - 90 - - Buy U.S. dollar, sell Canadian dollar USD 6 43 - (2) Buy euro, sell British pound EUR - 96 - - Buy British pound, sell euro GBP 17 - - - * Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD), euro (EUR), and British pound (GBP).

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The companys financial statements have been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst& Young LLP all of the companys financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders and directors meetings.
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the companys management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) . Based on our assessment, we believe the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013.
Ernst& Young LLP has issued an audit report on the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, and their report is included herein.
/s/ Ryan M. Lance /s/ Jeff W. Sheets Ryan M. Lance Jeff W. Sheets Chairman and Executive Vice President, Finance Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer February25, 2014 76 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConocoPhillips We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item8 and financial statement schedule listed in Item15(a). These financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ConocoPhillips internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February25, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ ERNST& YOUNG LLP Houston, Texas February25, 2014 77 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConocoPhillips We have audited ConocoPhillips internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2013 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report dated February25, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

83 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ConocoPhillips Note 1Accounting Policies n Consolidation Principles and Investments Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates operating and financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is either classified as available-for-sale if fair value is readily determinable, or the cost method is used if fair value is not readily determinable. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.
As a result of the separation of Phillips 66 on April30, 2012, the results of operations for our former refining, marketing and transportation businesses; most of our former Midstream segment; our former Chemicals segment; and our power generation and certain technology operations included in our former Emerging Businesses segment (collectively, our Downstream business), have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, the results of operations for our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Algeria and Nigeria businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3Discontinued Operations, for additional information.
We manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International. For additional information, see Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing operations.
n Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in common stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.
n Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
n Revenue Recognition Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer, which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry.
Revenues associated with producing properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.
Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).
84 Table of Contents n Shipping and Handling Costs We include shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased commodities. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as a component of revenue.
n Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
n Short-Term Investments Investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) with original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year are classified as short-term investments. See Note 15Derivative and Financial Instruments, for additional information on these held-to-maturity financial instruments.
n Inventories We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory. Commodity-related inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, consistent with industry practice.
n Fair Value Measurements We categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.
n Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity are recognized in other comprehensive income and appear on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will be recognized immediately in earnings.
85 Table of Contents n Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
Property Acquisition Costs Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment (PP&E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and managements judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
Exploratory Costs Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 8Suspended Wells, for additional information on suspended wells.
Development Costs Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.
Depletion and Amortization Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.
n Capitalized Interest Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.
n Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization of PP&E on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP&E are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).
n Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment PP&E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or 86 Table of Contents depreciation provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.
The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. The impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.
n Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
n Maintenance and Repairs Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.
n Property Dispositions When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the Gain on dispositions line of our consolidated income statement. When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.
n Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and PP&E. Over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in PP&E is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. For additional information, see Note10Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs.
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.
87 Table of Contents n Guarantees The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.
n Share-Based Compensation We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
n Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.
n Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.
n Net Income Per Share of Common Stock Basic net income per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock, along with an adjustment to net income for dividend equivalents paid on unvested unit awards that are considered participating securities. Diluted net income per share of common stock includes unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share, primarily under the treasury-stock method. Treasury stock and shares held by grantor trusts are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. The earnings per share impact of the participating securities is immaterial.
Note 2Change in Accounting Principles Effective January1, 2013, we early adopted, on a prospective basis, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2013-05, Parents Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.This ASU clarifies that the CTA should not be released into net income unless a parent sells a part of its investment within a foreign entity which represents the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the reporting parents investment in the broader foreign entity. The ASU also requires the release of all the related CTA into net income upon gaining control in a step acquisition of an equity method investment that is considered to be a stand-alone foreign entity, and a pro rata release of the related CTA into net income upon a partial sale of an interest in an equity method investment that is considered to be a stand-alone foreign entity. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements from the early adoption of this standard.
88 Table of Contents Note 3Discontinued Operations Separation of Downstream Business On April30, 2012, the separation of our Downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. In connection with the separation, Phillips 66 distributed approximately $7.8 billion to us in a special cash distribution. The principal funds from the special cash distribution were designated solely to pay dividends, repurchase common stock, repay debt, or a combination of the foregoing, within twelve months following the distribution. At December31, 2012, the remaining balance of the cash distribution was $748 million and was included in the Restricted cash line on our consolidated balance sheet. No balance remained from the cash distribution as of December31, 2013. We also entered into several agreements with Phillips 66 in order to effect the separation and govern our relationship with Phillips 66.
Sales and other operating revenues and income from discontinued operations related to Phillips 66 during 2012 and 2011 were as follows: MillionsofDollars 2012 2011 Sales and other operating revenues from discontinued operations $ 62,109 196,068 Income from discontinued operations before-tax $ 1,768 6,776 Income tax expense 534 1,729 Income from discontinued operations $ 1,234 5,047 Income from discontinued operations after-tax includes transaction, information systems and other costs incurred to effect the separation of $70 million and $17 million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. No separation costs were incurred in 2013.
Prior to the separation, commodity sales to Phillips 66 were $4,973 million and $15,822 million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Commodity purchases from Phillips 66 prior to the separation were $166 million and $516million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Prior to May1, 2012, commodity sales and related costs were eliminated in consolidation between ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. Beginning May1, 2012, these revenues and costs represent third-party transactions with Phillips 66.
Other Discontinued Operations As part of our ongoing strategic asset disposition program, we agreed to sell our interest in Kashagan and our Algeria and Nigeria businesses (collectively, the Disposition Group). The Disposition Group was previously part of the Other International operating segment.
On November26, 2012, we notified government authorities in Kazakhstan and co-venturers of our intent to sell the Companys 8.4 percent interest in Kashagan to ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL). On July2, 2013, we received notification from the government of Kazakhstan indicating it was exercising its right to pre-empt the proposed sale to OVL and designating KazMunayGas (KMG) as the entity to acquire the interest. On October31, 2013, we completed the transaction with KMG for total proceeds of $5,392 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in the Income from discontinued operations line on the consolidated income statement. We recorded pre-tax impairments of $43 million and $606 million in the first quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2012, respectively. At the time of disposition, the carrying value of the net assets related to our interest in Kashagan was $5,370 million, which included $212 million of other current assets, $239 million of long-term receivables, $5,149 million of PP&E, $144 million of other current liabilities, and $86 million of asset retirement obligations (ARO).
89 Table of Contents On December18, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Pertamina to sell our wholly owned subsidiary, ConocoPhillips Algeria Ltd. On November27, 2013, we completed the transaction with Pertamina, resulting in proceeds of $1,652 million, which included a $175 million deposit received in December 2012. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $938 million, which is included in the Income from discontinued operations line on the consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, the net carrying value of our Algerian assets was $714 million, which included $48 million of other current assets, $883 million of PP&E, $41 million of other current liabilities, $37 million of ARO, and $139 million of deferred taxes.
On December20, 2012, we entered into agreements with affiliates of Oando PLC to sell our Nigeria business. This includes its upstream affiliates and Phillips (Brass) Limited, which owns a 17 percent interest in the Brass LNG Project. Brass LNG plans to construct an LNG facility in the Niger Delta. In order to provide additional time for Oando to obtain financing and government consents, we agreed to further extend the outside date, or the date the sales agreements may terminate if closing has not occurred, for our Nigerian upstream affiliates to February28, 2014. We anticipate extending the outside date to enable a March 2014 closing. The upstream sale is expected to generate proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, after customary adjustments, inclusive of deposits received. We received deposits of $15 million and $435 million in December 2013 and 2012, respectively. In February 2014, we received an additional $50 million deposit, bringing our total deposits received to $500 million. We may retain the deposits if closing does not occur due to default by the buyer or failure to obtain all consents required under Nigerian petroleum laws. The buyer has until March31, 2014, to close on Brass LNG. The sale of our Brass LNG interest would generate proceeds of approximately $0.16 billion, after customary adjustments. As of December31, 2013, the net carrying value of our Nigerian assets was $409 million.
At December31, 2013, we classified $7 million of loans and advances to related parties in the Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties line and $1,215 million of noncurrent assets in the Prepaid expenses and other current assets line of our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we classified $765 million of noncurrent deferred income taxes in the Accrued income and other taxes line and $14 million of ARO in the Other accruals line of our consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities associated with the Disposition Group at December31 were as follows: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 Assets Accounts and notes receivable $ 376 268 Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties - 1 Inventories 9 44 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 72 220 Total current assets of discontinued operations 457 533 Investments and long-term receivables 60 272 Loans and advancesrelated parties 7 29 Net properties, plants and equipment 1,154 6,629 Other assets 1 4 Total assets of discontinued operations $ 1,679 7,467 Liabilities Accounts payable $ 419 471 Accrued income and other taxes 72 125 Total current liabilities of discontinued operations 491 596 Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs 14 131 Deferred income taxes 765 759 Total liabilities of discontinued operations $ 1,270 1,486 90 Table of Contents Sales and other operating revenues and income (loss) from discontinued operations related to the Disposition Group during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 2011 Sales and other operating revenues from discontinued operations $ 1,185 1,369 1,560 Income (loss) from discontinued operations before-tax $ 1,461 (6 ) 829 Income tax expense 283 211 562 Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1,178 (217 ) 267 Note 4Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information on our significant VIEs follows: Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) We have an agreement with Freeport LNG to participate in an LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we own a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which serves as the general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity, which expires in 2033. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. At December31, 2013, the prepaid balance of the terminal use agreement was $282 million, which is primarily reflected in the Other assets line on our consolidated balance sheet. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding was $506 million at December31, 2013, and $565million at December31, 2012.
In July 2013, we reached an agreement with Freeport LNG to terminate our long-term agreement at the Freeport LNG Terminal, subject to Freeport LNG obtaining regulatory approval and project financing for an LNG liquefaction and export facility in Texas, in which we are not a participant. Upon satisfaction of these conditions, currently expected to occur during the second half of 2014, we will pay Freeport LNG a termination fee of approximately $600million. Freeport LNG will repay the outstanding ConocoPhillips loan used by Freeport LNG to partially fund the original construction of the terminal. When the agreement becomes effective, we expect to recognize an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $540 million. At that time, our terminal regasification capacity will be reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day, until July1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero.
Freeport LNG is a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG, and the limited partners of Freeport LNG do not have any substantive decision making ability. Since we do not have the unilateral power to direct the key activities which most significantly impact its economic performance, we are not the primary beneficiary of Freeport LNG. These key activities primarily involve or relate to operating and maintaining the terminal. We also performed an analysis of the expected losses and determined we are not the primary beneficiary. This expected loss analysis took into account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to maintain sufficient commercial insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is accounted for as a financial asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity investment.
Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG) APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. We are not the primary beneficiary of APLNG because we share with Origin Energy and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) the power to direct the key activities of APLNG that most significantly impact its economic performance, which involve activities related to the 91 Table of Contents production and commercialization of coalbed methane, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate APLNG, and it is accounted for as an equity method investment.
As of December31, 2013, we have not provided any financial support to APLNG other than amounts previously contractually required. Unless we elect otherwise, we have no requirement to provide liquidity or purchase the assets of APLNG. See Note 7Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 13Guarantees, for additional information.

The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories was approximately $160million at December31, 2013, and $200 million at December31, 2012. In 2013, there were no liquidations of LIFO inventory values impacting net income from continuing operations.
Note 6Assets Held for Sale or Sold Assets Held for Sale Our interest in the Nigeria business was considered held for sale as of December31, 2013. See Note 3Discontinued Operations, for additional information.

94 Table of Contents At December31, 2013, retained earnings included $1,358million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies. Dividends received from affiliates were $1,425 million, $1,351 million and $3,670million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
APLNG In 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. APLNG is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. This transaction gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position with the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin is the operator of APLNGs production and pipeline system, while we will operate the LNG facility.
In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3million metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest diluting to 42.5percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011, and we recorded a loss on disposition of $279 million before- and after-tax from the dilution. The book value of our investment in APLNG was reduced by $795 million, and we reduced the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $516 million.
In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for the sale and purchase of an additional 3.3million metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035. This agreement, in combination with the execution of an LNG sale and purchase agreement with The Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc., in June 2012 for approximately 1.0million metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, finalized the marketing of the second train.
In July 2012, the APLNG co-venturers sanctioned the development of a second 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG production train. Upon sanctioning of the second train in July and in conjunction with the LNG sales agreement, Sinopec subscribed to additional shares in APLNG, which increased its equity interest from 15percent to 25 percent. As a result, on July12, 2012, both our ownership interest and Origins ownership interest diluted from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We recorded a before- and after-tax loss of $133 million from the dilution in the third quarter of 2012. The book value of our investment in APLNG was reduced by $453 million, and we reduced the foreign currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $320 million.
In addition, APLNG executed project financing agreements for an $8.5 billion project finance facility during the third quarter of 2012. The $8.5 billion project finance facility is composed of financing agreements executed by APLNG with the Export-Import Bank of the United States for approximately $2.9 billion, the Export-Import Bank of China for approximately $2.7 billion, and a syndicate of Australian and international commercial banks for approximately $2.9 billion. At December31, 2013, $7.3 billion had been drawn from the facility. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility which will be released upon meeting certain completion milestones. See Note 13Guarantees, for additional information.
APLNG is considered a VIE, as it has entered into certain contractual arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support. See Note 4Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) for additional information.
At December31, 2013, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $10,766million, which includes $1,159 million of cumulative translation effects due to a strengthening Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar over time. The historical cost basis of our 37.5percent share of net assets on the books of APLNG under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles was $5,160 million, resulting in a basis difference of $5,606million on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis difference, $4,022million associated with PP&E, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by APLNG, most of which are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each exploration license area will 95 Table of Contents periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization. As the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net income attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was after-tax expense of $16million, $19million and $17million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently producing licenses.
FCCL FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream 50/50 general partnership with Cenovus Energy Inc., produces bitumen in the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta and sells the bitumen blend. We account for our investment in FCCL under the equity method of accounting, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL converted to reflect the use of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.
At December31, 2013, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $10,273 million. FCCLs operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in 2007. In December 2013, we repaid the remaining balance of the obligation. See Note 12Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for additional information on this obligation.
QG3 QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $1,005 million as described below under Loans and Long-Term Receivables. At December31, 2013, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3, excluding the project financing, was $1,041million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Sabine Pass, Texas, in which we have a 12.4 percent interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United States.
Loans and Long-Term Receivables As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreements stated interest rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully recovered.
96 Table of Contents At December31, 2013, significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:  $506 million in loan financing to Freeport LNG Development, L.P. for the construction of an LNG receiving terminal that became operational in June 2008. Freeport LNG began making repayments in 2008 and is required to continue making repayments through full repayment of the loan in 2026. Repayment by Freeport LNG is supported by process-or-pay capacity service payments made by us to Freeport LNG under our terminal use agreement. See Note 4Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), for additional information.
$1,005 million in project financing to QG3. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, for which we use the equity method of accounting. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum and Mitsui. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Semi-annual repayments began in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.
The long-term portion of these loans is included in the Loans and advancesrelated parties line on our consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties.

Note 9Impairments During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 2011 Alaska $ 3 3 2 Lower 48 and Latin America 2 192 71 Canada 216 262 253 Europe 301 211 (37) Asia Pacific and Middle East 3 4 - Corporate 4 8 32 $ 529 680 321 2013 In 2013, we recorded property impairments of $216 million in our Canada segment, mainly as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions, reduced volume forecasts and higher costs.
In Europe, we recorded impairments of $301 million, primarily due to ARO revisions for properties in the United Kingdom which are nearing the end of their useful lives or have ceased production.
98 Table of Contents 2012 In 2012, we recorded a $192 million property impairment in the Lower 48 and Latin America segment related to the planned disposition of the majority of our producing zones in the Cedar Creek Anticline, located in southwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana.
The Canada segment included a $213million property impairment for the carrying value of capitalized project development costs associated with our Mackenzie Gas Project. Advancement of the project was suspended indefinitely in the first quarter of 2012 due to a continued decline in market conditions and the lack of acceptable commercial terms. We also recorded a $481 million impairment for the undeveloped leasehold costs associated with the project, which was included in the Exploration expenses line on our consolidated income statement. Additionally, we recorded impairments on various producing and non-producing properties.
In Europe, we recorded impairments of $211 million, mainly related to ARO revisions for properties which have ceased production or are nearing the end of their useful lives.
2011 During 2011, we recorded property impairments of $289 million, primarily in our Lower 48 and Latin America and Canada segments, largely as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions and reduced volume forecasts.
Note 10Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December31 were: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 Asset retirement obligations $ 10,076 9,164 Accrued environmental costs 348 364 Total asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs 10,424 9,528 Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs due within one year* (541 ) (581) Long-term asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs $ 9,883 8,947 * Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet under Other accruals and includes $14 million and $158 million of liabilities associated with assets held for sale at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Asset Retirement Obligations We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. If, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.
We have numerous asset retirement obligations we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska.
99 Table of Contents During 2013 and 2012, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 Balance at January1 $ 9,164 8,920 Accretion of discount 434 412 New obligations 410 315 Changes in estimates of existing obligations 707 543 Spending on existing obligations (298 ) (319) Property dispositions (163 ) (607) Foreign currency translation (178 ) 281 Separation of Downstream business - (381) Balance at December31 $ 10,076 9,164 Accrued Environmental Costs Total accrued environmental costs at December31, 2013 and 2012, were $348 million and $364million, respectively.
We had accrued environmental costs of $271million and $279million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to remediation activities in the United States and Canada. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $60million and $70million of environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, $17million and $15 million were included at both December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, where the Company has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30years.
Expected expenditures for environmental obligations acquired in various business combinations are discounted using a weighted-average 5percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $124 million at December31, 2013. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $19 million in 2014, $18 million in 2015, $10 million in 2016, $6 million in 2017, $4 million in 2018, and $82million for all future years after2018.

At December31, 2013, we classified $861 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility.
During 2013, the following debt instruments were repaid at maturity:  The $100 million 7.625% Debentures due 2013.
The $750 million 5.50% Notes due 2013.
In February 2014, the $400 million 4.75% Notes due 2014 were repaid at maturity.
At December31, 2013, we had a revolving credit facility totaling $7.5 billion expiring in August 2016. Our revolving credit facility may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
We have two commercial paper programs supported by our $7.5 billion revolving credit facility: the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion program, primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.15 billion program, which is used to fund commitments relating to QG3. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.
At both December31, 2013 and 2012, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, with no letters of credit as of December31, 2013. In addition, under the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, there was $961 million of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2013, compared with $1,055 million at December31, 2012. Since we had $961 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to $6.5 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at December31, 2013.
During the second quarter of 2013, a lease of a semi-submersible floating production system (FPS) commenced for the Gumusut development, located in Malaysia, in which we are a co-venturer. The FPS lease provides for an initial noncancelable term of 15 years, a subsequent 5-year cancelable term with no required lease payments, and an additional 5-year term with terms and conditions to be agreed at a later date. The lease has no ongoing purchase options or escalation clauses. Certain contingent rental payments may be incurred if actual commissioning costs exceed provisioned amounts. The lease does not impose any significant restrictions concerning dividends, debt or further leasing activities.
A capital lease asset and capital lease obligation were recognized for our proportionate interest in the FPS of $906 million, based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments using our pre-tax incremental borrowing rate of 3.58 percent for debt with similar terms. As of December31, 2013, the value of the lease asset and associated obligation is $906 million with commissioning activities continuing. Following the startup of the FPS, the capital lease asset will be depreciated over a period consistent with the estimated proved reserves of Gumusut using the unit-of-production method with the associated depreciation included in the Depreciation, depletion and amortization line on our consolidated income statement.
102 Table of Contents At December31, 2013, future minimum payments due under capital leases were: Millions ofDollars 2014 $ 127 2015 80 2016 80 2017 80 2018 80 Remaining years 769 Total 1,216 Less: portion representing imputed interest (294) Capital lease obligations $ 922 Note 12Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation We were obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to FCCL. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007. The principal portion of these payments totaled $772 million in 2013. In December 2013, we paid the remaining balance of the obligation, which totaled $2,810 million and is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrued at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Note 13Guarantees At December31, 2013, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability at inception for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were issued prior to December31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
APLNG Guarantees At December31, 2013, we have outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our 37.5 percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing December 2013 exchange rates:  We have guaranteed APLNGs performance with regard to a construction contract executed in connection with APLNGs issuance of the Train 1 and Train 2 Notices to Proceed. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee is 3 years. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to this guarantee is approximately $130million and would become payable if APLNG cancels the applicable construction contract and does not perform with respect to the amounts owed to the contractor.
We have issued a construction completion guarantee related to the third-party project financing secured by APLNG. Our maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is estimated to be $3.2 billion, which could be payable if the full debt financing capacity is utilized and completion of the project is not achieved. Our guarantee of the project financing will be released 103 Table of Contents upon meeting certain completion tests with milestones, which we estimate would occur beginning in 2016. Our maximum exposure at December31, 2013, is $2.8 billion based upon our pro-rata share of the facility used at that date. At December31, 2013, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately $114 million.
In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy in October 2008, we agreed to guarantee an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements with remaining terms of 3 to 18 years. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $0.8 billion ($1.9 billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.
We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the projects continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of up to 32 years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $170million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform.
Other Guarantees We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately $260million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate aircraft, guarantees to fund the short-term cash liquidity deficit of two joint ventures, a guarantee for our portion of a joint ventures debt obligations and a guarantee of minimum charter revenue for an LNG vessel. These guarantees have remaining terms of up to 10 years or the life of the venture and would become payable if, upon sale, certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities, or as a result of non-performance of contractual terms by guaranteed parties.
Indemnifications Over the years, we have entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. These agreements include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, employee claims, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December31, 2013, was approximately $60 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the recorded carrying amount at December31, 2013 were approximately $50million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in the Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs line on our consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note14Contingencies and Commitments.
In connection with the separation of the Downstream business, the Company entered into an Indemnification and Release Agreement with Phillips 66. This agreement provided for cross-indemnities between Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips and established proceduresfor handling claims subject to indemnification and related matters. We evaluated the impact of the indemnifications given and the Phillips 66 indemnifications received as of the separation date and concluded those fair values were immaterial.
104 Table of Contents Note 14Contingencies and Commitments A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See Note 20Income Taxes, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Environmental We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on managements best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies cleanup experience, and data released by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the agency concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state and international sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for 105 Table of Contents sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 10Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.
Legal Proceedings Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
Other Contingencies We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December31, 2013, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $827 million(issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan governments Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuelas national oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA),or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November2, 2007, with the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010. On September3, 2013, an ICSID arbitration tribunal held that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips significant oil investments in June 2007. A separate arbitration phase will proceed to determine the amount of damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Venezuelas actions.
In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by the ICSID tribunal, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the seized crude oil.In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. On April24, 2012, Ecuador filed supplemental counterclaims asserting environmental damages, which we believe are not material. The ICSID tribunal issued a decisionon liabilityon December14, 2012, in favor of Burlington, finding that Ecuadors seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration phase is now proceeding to determine thedamagesowed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuadors actions and to address Ecuadors counterclaims.
ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax assessments. As of December 2013, ConocoPhillips paid, under protest, tax assessments totaling approximately $232 million, which are primarily recorded in the Investments and long-term receivables line on our consolidated balance sheet. The arbitration will be conducted in Singapore under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Laws (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Stability Agreement with the Timor-Leste government. The arbitration process is currently underway. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.
106 Table of Contents Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the Companys business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2014$125 million; 2015$117 million; 2016$25 million; 2017$25million; 2018$22 million; and 2019 and after$121 million. Totalpayments under the agreements were $127million in 2013, $130million in 2012 and $429million in 2011.
Note 15Derivative and Financial Instruments We use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to meet our customer needs and capture market opportunities. Our commodity business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, LNG and natural gas liquids.
Our derivative instruments are held at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Where these balances have the right of setoff, they are presented on a net basis. Related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. On our consolidated income statement, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if directly related to our physical business or a net basis if held for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts that meet and are designated with the normal purchase normal sale exception are recognized upon settlement. We generally apply this exception to eligible crude contracts. We do not use hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives.
The following table presents the gross fair values of our commodity derivatives, excluding collateral, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 871 1,538 Other assets 64 105 Liabilities Other accruals 890 1,509 Other liabilities and deferred credits 58 99 The gains (losses) incurred from commodity derivatives, and the line items where they appear on our consolidated income statement were: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 2011 Sales and other operating revenues $ (160 ) (291 ) 907 Other income 4 (1 ) (9) Purchased commodities 139 214 (729) 107 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our material net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative contracts: OpenPosition Long/(Short) 2013 2012 Commodity Natural gas and power (billions of cubic feet equivalent) Fixed price (18 ) (48) Basis (10 ) 125 Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. Our foreign currency exchange derivative activity primarily consists of transactions designed to mitigate our cash-related and foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital programs or local currency tax payments, dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates. We do not elect hedge accounting on our foreign currency exchange derivatives.

108 Table of Contents Financial Instruments We invest excess cash in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we manage. The maturities of these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90days. The types of financial instruments include:  Time deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with approved financial institutions.
Commercial paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank, or government agency purchased at a discount, maturing at par.
These financial instruments appear in the Cash and cash equivalents line of our consolidated balance sheet if the maturities at the time we made the investments were 90 days or less; otherwise, these held-to-maturity investments are included in the Short-term investments line. At December31, we held the following financial instruments: Millions of Dollars Carrying Amount CashandCashEquivalents Short-TermInvestments 2013 2012 2013 2012 Cash $ 636 829 - - Time Deposits Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days 5,336 2,789 137 - Commercial Paper Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days 274 - 135 - $ 6,246 3,618 272 - In conjunction with the separation of our Downstream business, we received a special cash distribution from Phillips 66. See Note 3Discontinued Operations, for additional information. The balance of the special cash distribution was zero at December31, 2013, and $748 million at December31, 2012, and was included in Restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. At December31, 2012, the funds in the restricted cash account were invested in money market funds with maturities within 90 days from December31, 2012.
Credit Risk Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds, government debt securities and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.
The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.
109 Table of Contents Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New York Mercantile Exchange or IntercontinentalExchange.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, was $57 million and $130 million, respectively. For these instruments, no collateral was posted as of December31, 2013 or December31, 2012. If our credit rating had been lowered one level from its A rating (per Standard and Poors) on December31, 2013, we would be required to post no additional collateral to our counterparties. If we had been downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post $57 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
Note 16Fair Value Measurement We carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at a reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.
The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities that are initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available. Transfers occur at the end of the reporting period. There were no material transfers in or out of Level 1 during 2013 and 2012.
Recurring Fair Value Measurement Financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include commodity derivatives and certain investments to support nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The deferred compensation investments are measured at fair value using unadjusted prices available from national securities exchanges; therefore, these assets are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data. Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are long-term in nature and where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available.

111 Table of Contents Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurement The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy by major category for assets accounted for at fair value on a non-recurring basis: Millions of Dollars Fair Value MeasurementsUsing FairValue* Level 1 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Before-Tax Loss Year ended December31, 2013 Net PP&E (held for use) 117 - 117 488 Year ended December31, 2012 Net PP&E (held for sale) $ 6,116 6,116 - 798 Net PP&E (held for use) 95 - 95 134 *Represents the fair value at the time of the impairment.
Net PP&E (held for use) Net PP&E held for use is comprised of various producing properties impaired to their individual fair values. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices from futures exchanges and pricing service companies, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.
Net PP&E (held for sale) In 2012, net PP&E held for sale was written down to fair value, less costs to sell. The fair value of each asset was determined by its binding negotiated selling price.
Reported Fair Values of Financial Instruments We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:  Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion of fixed-rate related party loans is consistent with Loans and advancesrelated parties.
Loans and advancesrelated parties: The carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value. The fair value of fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 7Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional information.
Accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt: The carrying amount of accounts payable and floating-rate debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value. The valuation technique and methods used to estimate the fair value of the current portion of the joint venture acquisition obligation is consistent with the methodology below.
Fixed-rate debt: The estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Joint venture acquisition obligationrelated party: Fair value at December31, 2012, was estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows as a Level 2 fair value with an effective yield rate of 0.7percent, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of similar average duration adjusted for our average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. See Note 12Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for additional information.

114 Table of Contents Note 19Employee Benefit Plans Pension and Postretirement Plans In connection with the separation of the Downstream business in 2012, ConocoPhillips entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Phillips 66, which provides that employees of Phillips 66 no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by ConocoPhillips as of the separation date. Upon separation, the ConocoPhillips pension and postretirement plans transferred assets and obligations to the Phillips 66 plans resulting in a net decrease in sponsored pension and postretirement plan obligations of $1,127million. Additionally, as a result of the transfer of unrecognized losses to Phillips 66, deferred income taxes and other comprehensive income decreased $335 million and $570 million, respectively.

In 2013 and 2012, lump-sum benefit payments from the U.S. qualified pension plan exceeded the sum of service and interest costs for that plan and led to an increase in settlement losses.
In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.
We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 7.25percent in 2013 that declines to 5percent by 2023. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.
Plan Assets We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 59percent equity securities, 37 percent debt securities and 4 percent real estate. Generally, the plan investments are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.
118 Table of Contents The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December31, 2013 and 2012.
Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level1 are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. When observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
Fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates. U.S. cash balances held in the form of short-term fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as Level 2.
Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party sources.
Private equity funds are valued at net asset value as determined by the issuer based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans participants.
Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The participating interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a combination of quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations. At December31, 2013, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $110 million and consisted of $312 million in debt securities, less $202 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December31, 2012, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $133 million and consisted of $358 million in debt securities, less $225million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The net change from 2012 to 2013 is due to a decrease in the fair value of the underlying investments of $46 million and a decrease in the present value of the contract obligation of $23 million. The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

Level 3 activity was not material for all periods.
Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2014, we expect to contribute approximately $350million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans and $210million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of their eligible pay, subject to statutory limits, in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 37 investment funds. Starting in 2013, employees who participate in the CPSP and contribute 1 percent of their eligible pay receive a 9 percent Company cash match, subject to certain limitations. Prior to 2013, ConocoPhillips matched contribution deposits up to 1.25 percent of eligible pay. Company contributions charged to expense related to continuing and discontinued operations for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below), were $101 million in 2013, $16million in 2012, and $25 million in 2011.
The stock savings feature of the CPSP was a leveraged employee stock ownership plan; however, beginning in 2013, the CPSP no longer has a stock savings feature. Prior to 2013, employees could elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to the amount of contribution.
In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (subsequently the stock savings feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of Company common stock. Since the Company guaranteed the CPSPs borrowings, the unpaid balance was reported as a liability of the Company and unearned compensation was shown as a reduction of common stockholders equity. Dividends on all shares were charged against retained earnings. The debt was serviced by the CPSP from Company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP were released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In 2012, the final debt service payment was made and all remaining unallocated shares were released for allocation to participant accounts. The total number of allocated CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December31, 2013 and 2012, were 9,280,837 and 11,246,660, respectively.
With the stock savings feature, we recognized interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to continuing and discontinued operations for the stock savings feature of $104million and $77million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, all of which was compensation expense. In 2012 and 2011, we made cash contributions to the CPSP of $5 million and $4million, respectively. In 2011, we contributed 660,775 shares of Company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust. The shares had a fair value of $84 million. In 2012 and 2011, we contributed 1,554,355 and 475,696 shares, respectively, of Company common stock from treasury stock. Dividends used to service debt were $10million and $45million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense recognized in each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2012 and 2011 was $0.1million and $1million, respectively.
We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and 121 Table of Contents eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense related to continuing and discontinued operations recognized for these international plans was approximately $60 million in 2013 and $56 million in both 2012 and 2011.
Share-Based Compensation Plans The 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2011. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 100million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees and directors; however, as of the effective date of the Plan, (i)any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii)any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the Company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the 100million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options, and no more than 40million shares are available for awards in stock. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is authorized to determine the types, terms, conditions, and limitations of awards granted. Awards may be granted in the form of, but not limited to, stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units to employees and nonemployee directors who contribute to the Companys continued success and profitability.
Total share-based compensation expense is measured using the grant date fair value for our equity-classified awards and the settlement date fair value for our liability-classified awards. We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture. Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement. Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
Separation-Related Adjustments In connection with the separation of the Downstream business on April30, 2012, ConocoPhillips entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Phillips 66, which provided that employees of Phillips 66 no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by ConocoPhillips. Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, we made certain adjustments, using volumetric weighted-average prices for the 4-day period immediately prior to and immediately following the separation, to the exercise price and number of our share-based compensation awards, with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value of the awards immediately prior to the separation. These adjustments are summarized as follows:  Outstanding options to purchase common shares of ConocoPhillips stock that were exercisable prior to the separation were adjusted so that the holders of the options would then hold one option to purchase common shares of Phillips 66 stock for every two adjusted stock options to purchase common shares of ConocoPhillips stock following the separation.
Nonexercisable stock options and restricted stock units were converted to those of the entity where the employee holding them was working immediately post-separation. Therefore, nonexercisable stock options to purchase common shares of ConocoPhillips stock and ConocoPhillips restricted stock units held by an employee who separated with the Downstream business were surrendered as a result of the separation.
In addition, former employee holders and a specified group of holders of stock options and restricted stock units who retired or terminated employment upon or shortly after the separation received both adjusted ConocoPhillips awards and Phillips 66 awards.
122 Table of Contents  ConocoPhillips restricted stock and performance share units awarded for completed performance periods under the Performance Share Program, as well as vested restricted stock units held by current or former directors, were adjusted to provide holders one restricted share or restricted stock unit of Phillips66 stock for every two restricted shares or restricted stock units of ConocoPhillips stock.
The separation-related adjustments did not have a material impact on either compensation expense for the year ended December31, 2012, or the number of potentially dilutive securities as of December31, 2012, to be considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock.
Compensation Expense Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income related to continuing and discontinued operations and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December31 were as follows: Millions of Dollars 2013 2012 2011 Compensation cost $ 308 321 246 Tax benefit 109 118 86 Stock Options Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and prior plans permit purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of ConocoPhillips common stock on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to certain employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.
The fair market values of the options granted over the past three years were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Assumptions used Risk-free interest rate 1.09 % 1.62 3.10 Dividend yield 4.00 % 4.00 4.00 Volatility factor 28.95 % 33.30 33.40 Expected life (years) 5.95 7.42 6.87 There were no ranges in the assumptions used to determine the fair market values of our options granted over the past three years.
For 2012 and 2011, expected volatility was based on historical volatility of the Companys stock using ConocoPhillips end-of-week closing stock prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the options granted. Due to the separation of our Downstream business in 2012, expected volatility for grants of options in 2013 was based on a three-year average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies. We believe our historical volatility for periods prior to the separation of our Downstream business is no longer relevant in estimating expected volatility.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock option awards granted during 2012 and 2011 was $15.69 and $16.70, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2012 and 2011 was $469 million and $416 million, respectively.
During 2013, we received $103 million in cash and realized a tax benefit related to both continuing and discontinued operations of $47 million from the exercise of options. At December31, 2013, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $17 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.84 years, the longest period being 2.10 years.
Stock Unit Program Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan. Restricted stock units granted prior to 2013 vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the grant date. Beginning in 2013, restricted stock units granted will vest in an aggregate installment on the third anniversary of the grant date. In addition, beginning in 2012, restricted stock units granted under the Plan for a variable long-term incentive program vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award. Upon vesting, the restricted stock units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to retirement eligible employees vest six months from the grant date; however, those units are not issued as common stock until the earlier of separation from the Company or the end of the regularly scheduled vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the restricted stock units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. The grant date fair market value of these restricted stock units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock unit awards granted during 2012 and 2011 was $60.62 and $67.54, respectively. The total fair value of stock units issued during 2012 and 2011 was $187million and $109 million, respectively.
Performance Share Program Under the Plan, we also annually grant restricted performance share units (PSUs) to senior management. These PSUs are authorized three years prior to their effective grant date (the performance period). Compensation expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of ConocoPhillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the ConocoPhillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the grant date for stock-settled awards and the settlement date for cash-settled awards.
Stock-Settled For performance periods beginning before 2009, PSUs do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the Company. With respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, PSUs do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and restrictions do not lapse until the earlier of the employees separation from the Company or five years after the grant date (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation). We recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest, absent employee election to defer, upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period. PSUs are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-settled performance share units granted during 2012 and 2011 was $74.16 and $70.57, respectively. The total fair value of stock-settled PSUs issued during 2012 and 2011 was $71 million and $37 million, respectively.
Cash-Settled In connection with and immediately following the separation of our Downstream business in 2012, new performance share units, subject to a shortened performance period, were authorized to be granted. Once granted, these PSUs vest, absent employee election to defer, on the earlier of five years after the grant date of the award or the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement. For employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. Otherwise, we recognize compensation expense beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. These PSUs are settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and thus are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. Until settlement occurs, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense.
Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants will vest upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period. We recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period. These PSUs will be settled in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit on the settlement date and are classified as liabilities on the balance sheet.
The following summarizes our cash-settled Performance Share Program activity for the year ended December31, 2013: Weighted-Average MillionsofDollars StockUnits Grant-DateFair Value TotalFairValue Outstanding at December31, 2012 - $ - Granted 128,567 58.08 Forfeited - - Settled (3,791 ) $ - Outstanding at December31, 2013 124,776 $ 58.08 Not Vested at December31, 2013 82,793 $ 58.08 126 Table of Contents At December31, 2013, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost from unvested cash-settled performance share awards was $4 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.13years, the longest period being 4.10 years. There were no cash-settled performance share awards granted, issued or outstanding as of December31, 2012 or 2011.
From inception of the Performance Share Program through 2013, approved PSU awards were granted after the conclusion of performance periods. Beginning in February 2014, initial target PSU awards will be issued near the beginning of new performance periods. These initial target PSU awards will terminate at the end of the performance periods and will be settled after the performance periods have ended. Also in 2014, initial target PSU awards will be issued for open performance periods that began in prior years. For the open performance period beginning in 2012, the initial target PSU awards will terminate at the end of the three-year performance period and will be replaced with approved PSU awards. For the open performance period beginning in 2013, the initial target PSU awards will terminate at the end of the three-year performance period and will be settled after the performance period has ended. There is no effect on recognition of compensation expense.
Other In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.
The following summarizes the aggregate activity of these restricted shares and units for the year ended December31, 2013: Weighted-Average MillionsofDollars StockUnits Grant-DateFair Value Total Fair Value Outstanding at December31, 2012 1,132,556 $ 27.34 Granted 76,920 62.52 Forfeited (3,458 ) 20.22 Issued (33,417 ) $ 2 Outstanding at December31, 2013 1,172,601 $ 29.31 Not Vested at December31, 2013 - At December31, 2013, all outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units were fully vested and there was no remaining compensation cost to be recorded. The weighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted during 2012 and 2011 was $63.54 and $70.25, respectively. The total fair value of awards issued during 2012 and 2011 was $73 million and $10 million, respectively.

We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2015 and 2034 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.
128 Table of Contents Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2013, valuation allowances decreased a total of $376million. This primarily relates to a net utilization of loss carryforwards, a utilization of U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards and relinquishment of assets. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.
At December31, 2013 and 2012, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $3,222 million and $2,286 million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed.
The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for 2013, 2012 and 2011: MillionsofDollars 2013 2012 2011 Balance at January1 $ 872 1,071 1,125 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 52 98 46 Additions for tax positions of prior years 30 48 145 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (251 ) (206 ) (35 ) Settlements (48 ) (108 ) (206 ) Lapse of statute - (31 ) (4 ) Balance at December31 $ 655 872 1,071 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $440 million, $650million and $815 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate.
At December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $120million, $129million and $141million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a benefit to earnings in 2013 of $9 million, a benefit to earnings in 2012 of $9 million, and a charge to earnings in 2011 of $10 million.
We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2010), Canada (2006), United States (2008)and Norway (2012). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.
129 Table of Contents The amounts of U.S. and foreign income from continuing operations before income taxes, with a reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory rate with the provision for income taxes, were: Millions of Dollars Percent of Pretax Income 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 Income before income taxes from continuing operations United States $ 5,046 4,070 4,762 34.9 % 26.4 30.9 Foreign 9,400 11,353 10,634 65.1 73.6 69.1 $ 14,446 15,423 15,396 100.0 % 100.0 100.0 Federal statutory income tax $ 5,056 5,398 5,389 35.0 % 35.0 35.0 Foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rate 1,389 2,878 2,658 9.6 18.6 17.3 Capital loss benefit (79 ) (461 ) - (0.5 ) (3.0 ) - Federal manufacturing deduction (35 ) (52 ) (73 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.5 ) State income tax 79 166 266 0.5 1.1 1.7 Other (1 ) 13 (32 ) - 0.1 (0.2 ) $ 6,409 7,942 8,208 44.4 % 51.5 53.3 The change in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to lower income in high tax jurisdictions in 2013. The change in the effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the effect of the Companys asset disposition program, partially offset by higher income in high tax jurisdictions in 2012.
Statutory tax rate changes did not have a significant impact on our income tax expense in 2013.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July17, 2012, restricting corporate tax relief on decommissioning costs to 50 percent, retroactively effective from March21, 2012. Our 2012 earnings were reduced by $192 million due to remeasurement of deferred tax balances as of the effective date.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July19, 2011, which increased the supplementary corporate tax rate applicable to U.K. Upstream activity from 20 to 32 percent, retroactively effective from March24, 2011. This resulted in the overall U.K. corporate rate increasing from 50 percent to 62 percent. The enactment resulted in increased U.K. corporate income tax expense of $316 million in 2011. This is comprised of $106 million due to remeasurement of U.K. deferred tax liabilities, and $210 million to reflect the new rate from March24, 2011, through December31, 2011.

Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are defined by geographic region: Alaska, Lower 48 and Latin America, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East, and Other International.
On April30, 2012, our Downstream business was separated into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation, Phillips 66. In 2012, we also agreed to sell our Nigeria and Algeria businesses and our interest in Kashagan. Accordingly, results for these operations have been reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Commodity sales to Phillips 66, which were previously eliminated in consolidation prior to the separation, are now reported as third-party sales. For additional information, see Note 3Discontinued Operations.
Our LUKOIL Investment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
Corporate and Other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, corporate overhead, costs associated with the separation and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues.

137 Table of Contents Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited) In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic932, Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas, and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates oil and gas activities in our operating segments. As a result, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At December31, 2013, approximately 7 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, located in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area.
Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United Kingdom), Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Russia and Caspian regions.
As part of our ongoing asset disposition program, we agreed to sell our interest in Kashagan, and the Algeria and Nigeria businesses. These businesses have been considered held for sale since the fourth quarter of 2012 and have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, the Results of Operations, Average Sales Prices and Net Production tables included within the supplemental oil and gas disclosures reflect the associated earnings and production as discontinued operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the transactions for the sale of our interest in Kashagan and the Algeria business; accordingly, as of December31, 2013, we no longer held reserves for these assets. See Note 3Discontinued Operations, for additional information.
Reserves Governance The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
138 Table of Contents We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business units reserve processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the Companys Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists, finance personnel and a senior representative from DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), reviews the business units reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal audit group. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.
During 2013, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December31, 2013, were reviewed by D&M, a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips technical staff presented D&M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Managements intent in retaining D&M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&Ms opinion was the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December31, 2013, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&Ms report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the Companys reserve estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual is a petroleum engineer with a bachelors degree in civil engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience, including drilling and production engineering assignments in several field locations. He has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, reserves reporting and compliance, and business management.
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December31, 2013, included:  Revisions : In 2013, revisions were primarily due to higher prices in 2013 versus 2012, and improved well performance in Lower 48 and Canada. In 2012, revisions in Lower 48 were primarily due to lower prices in 2012 versus 2011. In 2012, revisions in Canada were primarily due to lower prices in 2012 versus 2011, partially offset by improved well performance. In our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, revisions in 2012 were primarily due to development activities in various fields. Revisions in Africa in 2012 were primarily due the execution of a gas sales agreement.
Extensions and discoveries : In 2013, 2012 and 2011, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily due to continued drilling success in Eagle Ford, Bakken and Barnett. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, for our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries were due to APLNGs ongoing development drilling onshore Australia.
Sales : In 2012, for our equity affiliates in Asia Pacific/Middle East, sales were primarily due to the dilution of our interest in APLNG.

In 2012, for our equity affiliates, revisions were primarily due to well performance and denser well spacing at Foster Creek and Christina Lake. In 2011, for our equity affiliates, revisions were primarily due to new subsurface interpretations, as well as the effects of higher prices on sliding scale royalty provisions.
Extensions and discoveries : In 2012, for our equity affiliates, extensions and discoveries were primarily related to the ongoing project development of Christina Lake and sanctioning of Narrows Lake. In 2011, for our consolidated operations, extensions and discoveries were related to continued development of Surmont. In 2011, for our equity affiliates, extensions and discoveries mainly reflect the continued development of FCCL.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves We had 3,314million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2013, compared with 3,017million BOE at year-end 2012. During 2013, we converted 330million BOE of undeveloped reserves to developed primarily through ongoing development activities, as well as from the startup of major development projects. In addition, we added 627million BOE of undeveloped reserves in 2013,mainly through extensions and discoveries from ongoing development progress, major project sanctions and exploration success, as well as through revisions. These additions were offset by the sale of our interest in Kashagan in 2013, which represented a decrease of 117million BOE of undeveloped reserves. As a result, at December31, 2013, our proved undeveloped reserves represented 37 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 35 percent at December31, 2012. Costs incurred for the year ended December31, 2013, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $12.5billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate to development projects where the proved undeveloped reserves will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.
Approximately 75percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2013 were associated with seven major development areas. Six of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:  FCCL oil sandsFoster Creek and Christina Lake in Canada.
The Surmont oil sands project in Canada.
The Eagle Ford area in the Lower 48.
The APLNG project onshore Australia.
The Ekofisk Field in the North Sea.
149 Table of Contents The remaining major development area, Narrows Lake in our FCCL oil sands in Canada, was sanctioned for development in 2012.
At the end of 2013, approximately 20 percent of our total proved undeveloped reserves, located in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada, have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The oil sands in Canada consist of the FCCL and Surmont steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects. The majority of our remaining proved undeveloped reserves in this area were recorded beginning in 2007. Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent levels. The associated undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed over the life of the project as additional well pairs are drilled to maintain throughput at the central processing facilities.
Results of Operations The Companys results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2013, 2012 and 2011 are shown in the following tables. Non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, and crude oil and gas marketing activities are excluded. Additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:  Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.
Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.
Transportation costs include costs to transport our produced hydrocarbons to their points of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process natural gas to natural gas liquids. The profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest is deemed to be outside oil and gas producing activities.
Other related expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous expenses.

156 Table of Contents Development and Exploration Activities The following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unknown field or a new reservoir within a proven field. Excluded from the exploratory well count are stratigraphic-type exploratory wells, primarily relating to oil sands delineation wells located in Canada and coalbed methane test wells located in Asia Pacific/Middle East.

Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.
While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

ConocoPhillips Company is 100 percent owned by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I are indirect, 100 percent owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, with respect to their publicly held debt securities. Similarly, ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition, ConocoPhillips Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and several. The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for:  ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I (in each case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of accounting).
All other nonguarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.
The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips results on a consolidated basis.
In February 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which ConocoPhillips, as a well-known seasoned issuer, has the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities, with certain debt securities guaranteed by ConocoPhillips Company. Also as part of that registration statement, ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have the ability to issue and sell preferred trust securities, guaranteed by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have not issued any trust-preferred securities under this registration statement, and thus have no assets or liabilities. Accordingly, columns for these two trusts are not included in the condensed consolidating financial information.
In 2013, we completed a legal amalgamation of ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II and Burlington Resources Finance Company, with the amalgamated company continuing as ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I. The amalgamation did not significantly change the nature of the outstanding debt of these entities or the terms of parental guarantees, which remain full and unconditional, as well as joint and several.
