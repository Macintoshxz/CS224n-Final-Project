Items 1 and 2Business and Properties, contain forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words anticipate, estimate, believe, budget, continue, could, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, will, would, expect, objective, projection, forecast, goal, guidance, outlook, effort, target and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the companys disclosures under the heading CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, beginning on page 73.
Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTI ES C ORPORATE STRUCTURE ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August30, 2002.
Our business is organized into six operating segments:  Exploration and Production (E&P) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.
Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.
Refining and Marketing (R&M) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.
LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAOLUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).
Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations.
At December31, 2011, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 29,800 people.
Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses On July14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company.
1 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The separation would be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips shareholders on the record date for such distribution.
In October 2011, we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November14, 2011, and an amendment on January3, 2012.
The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATI ON For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 25Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P) At December31, 2011, our E&P segment represented 67percent of ConocoPhillips total assets. This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. Operations to liquefy natural gas, transport and market the resulting LNG are also included in the E&P segment. At December31, 2011, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia.
The E&P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment discussion exclude amounts related to LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is included in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures, as well as in the following net proved reserves table, for periods before we ceased using equity-method accounting for this investment, which occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2010.
The information listed below appears in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference:  Proved worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil reserves.
Net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil.
Average sales prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids, natural gas, bitumen and synthetic oil.
Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.
Developed and undeveloped acreage.
2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the Oil and Gas Operations disclosures following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 80 percent of our proved reserves are located in politically stable countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of factors that will enhance the understanding of the table below.

During 2011, 653,000BOED were produced in the United States, a 5 percent decrease from 686,000 BOED in 2010. Production from our international E&P operations averaged 966,000BOED in 2011, a 9 percent decrease from 1,066,000 BOED in 2010. Worldwide production decreased primarily due to suspended operations in Libya and Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production.
E&Ps worldwide annual average crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price increased 34 percent, from $72.77 per barrel in 2010 to $97.22 per barrel in 2011. Worldwide bitumen prices increased 18 percent, from $53.06 per barrel in 2010 to $62.56 per barrel in 2011. E&Ps average annual worldwide natural gas sales price increased 7 percent, from $4.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2010 to $5.34 per thousand cubic feet in 2011.
E&PUNITED STATES In 2011, U.S. E&P operations contributed 45 percent of E&Ps worldwide liquids production and 36percent of natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaskas North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant which processes natural gas for reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bays satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area.
Greater Kuparuk Area We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is made up of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay on Alaskas North Slope. Field installations include three central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. The natural gas is either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection.
Western North Slope On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In December 2011, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted us a permit required to build a gravel road, bridge and pipeline crossing over the Nigliq channel of the Colville River for development of a satellite field west of Alpine in the National Petroleum ReserveAlaska (NPRA), the Alpine West CD5 Project. We plan to incorporate the terms of the permit into our project plan as we progress project sanctioning of CD5 in 2012. Initial production is anticipated toward the end of 2015.
Cook Inlet Area We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Plant in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Our share of production is used to supply feedstock and fuel to the Kenai LNG Plant and is also sold to local utilities.
In October 2011, we acquired an additional 30 percent interest in the Kenai LNG Plant, bringing our ownership interest to 100 percent. The Kenai LNG Plant had historically supplied LNG to utility companies in Japan. Due to market conditions, the Kenai Plant was scheduled to be mothballed in the second quarter of 2011; however, we delayed the shutdown in order to ship additional cargoes to Asia, due to energy shortages caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In November 2011, we idled the plant for future use. We subsequently secured additional third-party gas supplies, and as a result, expect to resume limited LNG exports in the second half of 2012.
4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploration In the February 2008 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease Sale 193, we successfully bid and were awarded 10-year-primary-term leases on 98 blocks in the Chukchi Sea.We plan to drill an exploration well on our Chukchi Sea leasehold in 2014, subject to the outcome of pending litigation challenging Lease Sale 193 and the receipt of required regulatory permits.
In January 2010, we exchanged a 25 percent working interest in 50 of our leases in the Chukchi Sea for cash consideration and additional working interests in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In late 2010, we entered into an agreement to farm-down an additional 10 percent of our working interest in the same Chukchi Sea leases, and that agreement received regulatory approval in July 2011.
Transportation We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok Pipelines on the North Slope.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering third-party vessels as necessary.
In 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc formed a limited liability company to progress the pipeline project named DenaliThe Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project was intended to move natural gas from Alaskas North Slope to North American markets. In May 2011, the project was canceled as a result of insufficient customer transportation commitments to the project.

We also have operations in the Wind River Basin, East Texas, Rockies and northern and southern Louisiana. Onshore activities in 2011 were centered mostly on continued optimization and development of existing assets, with particular focus on areas with higher liquids production.
5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Shale Plays Exploration and development continues in our shale positions in Eagle Ford, Bakken and Barnett. In the Eagle Ford, we drilled approximately 160 exploration and development wells in 2011 and plan to drill approximately 200 wells in 2012. With subsequent investments, we expect to achieve peak production in 2017 and long-term average production of 140,000 BOED. During 2011, we acquired approximately 240,000 additional acres in various resource plays across the Lower 48, which included the Avalon, Wolfcamp and Niobrara areas, further expanding our significant acreage position in Lower 48 shale plays.
San Juan The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We continue to pursue development opportunities in three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin.
Gulf of Mexico At year-end 2011, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:  75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.
16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.
16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess Field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.
12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area.
Exploration In the Gulf of Mexico, we have a 45 percent interest in the Coronado well, which was spud in October 2011. A decision to cease drilling the well was made prior to reaching the targeted depth, and the well was expensed as a dry hole. We are in the planning process to appraise the results of Tiber and Shenandoah, which were discovered in 2009. Additionally, we were the successful bidder on 75 blocks in the Paleogene play in OCS Lease Sale 218 in December 2011. We expect these blocks will be awarded in 2012.
Offshore south Louisiana, we drilled the Shalimar exploration well. The well did not reach its target depth due to technical drilling issues and was expensed as a dry hole.
Onshore, we actively pursued the appraisal of our existing unconventional resource plays, including the Eagle Ford in South Texas, the Bakken in the Williston Basin, and the Barnett in the Fort Worth Basin. We have seen encouraging results in these liquids-rich plays and plan to continue appraisal and development in 2012.
Transportation We have a 25 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline (REX). The REX natural gas pipeline runs 1,679 miles from Cheyenne, Colorado, to Clarington, Ohio, and has a natural gas transmission capacity of 1.8billion cubic feet per day. Numerous compression facilities support the pipeline system. The REX pipeline is designed to enable natural gas producers in the Rocky Mountains region to deliver natural gas supplies to the Midwest and eastern regions of the United States. Upon the completion of the separation of the downstream businesses, we expect REX will be included in the new downstream company, Phillips 66.
E&PEUROPE In 2011, E&P operations in Europe contributed 20 percent of E&Ps worldwide liquids production and 14percent of natural gas production. Our European assets are principally located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

Ekofisk crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Our Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects continue to progress, with production from both of these projects expected in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
The Alvheim development consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the United Kingdom via a pipeline to the Beryl-Sage system.
The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is transported to Mongstad in Norway and Tetney in the United Kingdom by double-hulled shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is transported and sold to buyers in Europe, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18.3 percent interest.
The Statfjord Field straddles the boundary between the United Kingdom and Norway. In January 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the Statfjord Field and associated satellites. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012.
We also have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea.
Exploration During 2011, we drilled one exploration well, Peking Duck (7/11-12S), including the Agn sidetrack well (7/11-12A). The wells were non-commercial gas discoveries and were expensed as dry holes. In addition, we participated in two partner-operated wells, Caterpillar (PL340BS) in the Alvheim Area and Arran (PL309) in the Oseberg Area. The Caterpillar discovery is currently being evaluated. Arran was a dry hole and has been plugged and abandoned.
We were awarded three new licenses in the Norwegian 21 st Licensing Round: PL603, a 25 percent working interest in the Norwegian Sea; PL605, a 50 percent operating interest in the Barents Sea; and PL615, a 25percent working interest in the Barents Sea. We acquired 3D seismic over PL605.
Transportation We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a terminal and natural gas processing facility in Teesside, England.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project We are involved with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake natural gas field, one of the primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta, which would anchor the pipeline development. In March 2011, the project received regulatory approval from the National Energy Board of Canada. However, due to a continued decline in market conditions and lack of resolution with the Canadian government on fiscal terms, we are currently evaluating multiple options regarding the scope and timing of this project. Should the project not proceed, we would need to assess for impairment the carrying value of the undeveloped leasehold and capitalized project development costs, which totaled $662 million at December31, 2011, including capitalized interest.
Amauligak We have a 53.8 percent operating interest in Amauligak, which lies approximately 31 miles offshore in shallow water in the Beaufort Sea. A range of development options are being evaluated.
Exploration We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, onshore western Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands.During 2011, we conducted pilot drilling programs in the Muskwa (Horn River Basin) and Duvernay (West Shale Basin) unconventional resource plays, and we acquired approximately 260,000 acres of exploration leasehold in the Canol Shale, Duvernay Shale and other plays.
E&PSOUTH AMERICA Venezuela In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan governments Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuelas national oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA),or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November2, 2007, with the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we are currently awaiting an interim decision on key legal and factual issues. A separate arbitration hearing was held in January 2012 before the International Chamber of Commerce on ConocoPhillips separate claims against PDVSA for certain breaches of their Association Agreements prior to the expropriation.
Ecuador In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil.In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011. On September30, 2011, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe will not be material. The arbitration process is ongoing.

Origin operates APLNGs production and pipeline system, and we will operate the LNG facility. Natural gas is currently sold to domestic customers, while progress continues on the development of an LNG processing and export sales business. Once established, this will enhance our LNG position and serve as an additional LNG hub supplying Asia Pacific markets. Two initial 4.5-million-tonnes-per-year LNG trains are anticipated, with over 10,000 net wells ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG development. The additional wells will be supported by expanded gas gathering systems, centralized gas processing and compression stations, and water treatment facilities, in addition to a new export pipeline from the gas fields to the LNG facilities.
The project received environmental approval from the Australian federal government in February 2011, and a final investment decision on the initial LNG train and common facilities was approved in July 2011. The projects first LNG exports are expected to begin in 2015.
In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest diluting from 50 percent to 42.5percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011.
In November 2011, APLNG signed a binding Heads of Agreement with Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc., for the sale of approximately 1million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Kansai Electric will be supplied LNG beginning in mid-2016. The agreement is subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train, which is expected in the first half of 2012.

Production from the Phase I development of the PL 19-3 Field began in 2002. The Phase II development includes six drilling and production platforms and an FPSO vessel used to accommodate production from all the fields.
13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On July13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the Peoples Republic of China instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19-3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai 19-3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately 2,600barrels of mineral oil-based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil-based drilling mud was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative measure to capture any residue.
The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised development plan was submitted to Chinas National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012.
The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited development and field optimization, reduced 2011average daily net production from the field by 14,000barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.
In January 2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with Chinas Ministry of Agriculture to resolve fishery-related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and for related projects.

Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings were $267 million, $230million and $190million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure consistent health, safety and environmental excellence. In support of the goal of zero incidents, we have implemented an HSE Excellence process, which enables business units to measure their performance and compliance with our HSE Management System requirements, identify gaps, and develop improvement plans. Assessments are conducted annually to capture progress and set new targets. We are also committed to continuously improving process safety and preventing releases of hazardous materials.

30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.
Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining margins.
Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products. The factors influencing these prices are beyond our control. Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and refined products prices may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce economically, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows.
Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen and natural gas production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.
The rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil and natural gas. Accordingly, to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil, bitumen and natural gas we produce with good prospects for future production, our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations.
Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.
Our proved reserve information included in this annual report has been derived from engineering estimates prepared or reviewed by our personnel. Any significant future price changes could have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation. Reserve estimation is a process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported.
We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.
Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:  The discharge of pollutants into the environment.
Emissions into the atmosphere (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions as they are, or may become, regulated).
The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and clean up of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.
Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and shale gas plays.
31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
Although our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the Earths climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products could fall.
In addition, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, the United States, as well as other countries where we do business, may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
Actions of the U.S., state and local governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and may continue to do so in the future.
Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 60 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the United States in 2011, and 56 percent of our proved reserves, as of December31, 2011, was located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations.
Changes in governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas.
Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil, bitumen and natural gas. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.
Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture participants. There is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We do not insure against all potential losses; and therefore, we could be harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.
We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from operating risks. As such, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover us against potential losses arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital, exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.
The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, pipeline interruptions, pipeline ruptures, crude oil or refined products spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, or cyber attacks. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation.
The proposed separation of our downstream businesses is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, which may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or may not achieve the intended results.
We expect the separation will be effective in the second quarter of 2012. Our ability to timely effect the separation is subject to several conditions, including, among others, the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and the SEC declaring effective a registration statement relating to the securities of Phillips 66. We cannot assure we will be able to complete the separation in a timely fashion, if at all. For these and other reasons, the separation may not be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated. Further, if the separation is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. Any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Item1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
Item3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as matters previously reported in our 2010 Form 10-K and our first-,second- and third-quarter 2011 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2011. Material developments to the previously reported matters have been included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings was decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to SEC regulations.
Our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of the Federal Clean Air Act, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), six states and one local air pollution agency. Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations. Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories. As part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties. If a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in SEC rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty.
33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements New Matters In December 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the EPA of alleged violations related to the use of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). The EPA intends to present an administrative settlement agreement to resolve the alleged violations under which it would seek a penalty of $250,000. ConocoPhillips is working with the EPA to resolve this matter.
On November28, 2011, the Borger Refinery received a Notice of Enforcement from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for alleged emissions events that occurred during inclement weather in January and February 2011. The TCEQ is seeking a penalty of $120,000. ConocoPhillips is working with TCEQ to resolve this matter.
In October 2011, ConocoPhillips was notified by the Attorney General of the State of California it was conducting an investigation into possible violations of the regulations relating to the operation of underground storage tanks at gas stations in California. ConocoPhillips is contesting these allegations.
Matters Previously Reported On April13, 2011, ConocoPhillips received a Notice of Enforcement and Proposed Agreed Order from the TCEQ seeking a penalty to settle several violations of air pollution control regulations and/or facility permit conditions at the Borger Refinery. These violations were previously disclosed on the ConocoPhillips Borger Refinery Title V deviation report. The TCEQ approved the settlement of this matter on October18, 2011, with payment of a $70,963 penalty and a $70,962 Supplemental Environmental Project. This matter is now resolved.
In October 2007, we received a Complaint from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water Act related to a 2006 oil spill at our Bayway Refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000. ConocoPhillips is working with the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to resolve this matter.
In 2009, ConocoPhillips notified the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) it had self-identified certain compliance issues related to Benzene Waste Operations National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants requirements at its Trainer, Pennsylvania, and Borger, Texas, facilities. On January6, 2010, the DOJ provided its initial penalty demand for this matter as part of our confidential settlement negotiations. ConocoPhillips has reached an agreement with the EPA and DOJ regarding an appropriate penalty amount, which will be reflected in the third amendment to the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-05-258 (the agreed-upon penalty amount remains confidential until that time).
On May19, 2010, the Lake Charles Louisiana Refinery received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) alleging various violations of applicable air emission regulations, as well as certain provisions of the consent decree in Civil Action No. H-01-4430. ConocoPhillips is working with the LDEQ to resolve this matter.
In October 2003, the District Attorneys Office in Sacramento, California, filed a complaint in California Superior Court for alleged methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) contamination in groundwater. On April4, 2008, the District Attorneys Office filed an amended complaint that included alleged violations of state regulations relating to operation or maintenance of underground storage tanks. There are numerous defendants named in the suit in addition to ConocoPhillips. On December19, 2011, the Court approved a settlement of this lawsuit which includes the payment of $500,000 which will be treated as a civil penalty. This matter is now resolved.

The terms earnings and loss as used in Managements Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 29,800employees worldwide, and at year-end 2011 had assets of $153 billion. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol COP.
Our business is organized into six operating segments:  Exploration and Production (E&P) This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.
Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.
Refining and Marketing (R&M) This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.
LUKOIL Investment This segment consists of our past investment in the ordinary shares of OAOLUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).
Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations.
39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our earnings depend largely on the profitability of our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors affecting our profitability. In recent years, the business environment for the energy industry has experienced extreme volatility. As a result, in late 2009, we announced several strategic initiatives designed to improve our financial position and increase returns on capital. We have made significant progress on our three-year strategic plan through portfolio optimization, debt reduction and increased shareholder distributions. During 2011, we announced plans to sell an additional $5$10 billion of noncore assets over the next two years, bringing the total asset divestiture program target to $15$20 billion for the years 2010 through 2012. As of year-end 2011, we have generated approximately $10.7 billion from asset dispositions, the proceeds of which were primarily targeted toward share repurchases and debt reduction.
We also completed the sale of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011, which generated total proceeds of $9.5 billion in 2010 and 2011. These proceeds were largely used to fund share repurchases. In December 2011, our Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10billion of our common stock over the next two years. This increased the share repurchase program from $15 billion to $25 billion. Since the inception of the share repurchase programs, we have repurchased 15 percent of our shares outstanding for a total of $15 billion. During 2011, we also increased the amount of our quarterly dividend rate by 20percent, paid dividends on our common stock of $3.6billion for the full year and reduced our debt by 4 percent.
Our total capital program in 2012 is expected to be $15.5 billion, a $1.5 billion increase from $14.0billion in 2011. We also expect 2012 production to be approximately 1.6million barrels of oil equivalent per day(BOED), excluding the impact of any additional asset sales.
Consistent with our strategy to focus on value creation for our shareholders, in July 2011, our Board approved pursuing the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment. We believe the separation will enable each company to pursue a more focused strategy, which will enable the management of each company to concentrate their resources on its particular market segments, customers and core businesses. The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.
Upon completion of the separation, ConocoPhillips will be a large and geographically diverse pure-play exploration and production company. Our strategy of enhancing returns on capital through developing new resources, growing reserves and production per share, continuing the asset sale program and increasing shareholder distributions will not change.
Phillips 66 will be an integrated downstream company, with operations encompassing natural gas gathering and processing, crude oil refining, petroleum products marketing, transportation, power generation and petrochemicals manufacturing and marketing.
We believe the execution of our strategic plan will position the two companies to be successful and competitive in the long term. Other important factors that we must continue to manage well in order to sustain our long-term competitive position include:  Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.
Safety is our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins.
During 2011, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 92percent, compared with 81percent in 2010. The increase in 2011 primarily resulted from the removal of the Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) from our refining capacities effective January1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned maintenance.
40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There has been heightened public focus on the safety of the oil and gas industry as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities. In 2010, we formed a non-profit organization, the Marine Well Containment Company LLC (MWCC), with Exxon Mobil Corporation, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to develop a new oil spill containment system and improve industry spill response in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. To complement this work internationally, in 2011, we and several leading oil and gas companies established the Subsea Well Response Project in Norway, and we participated in the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group in the United Kingdom.
Adding to our proved reserve base.
We primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways: o Successful exploration and development of new fields.
o Acquisition of existing fields.
o Application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
Through a combination of the methods listed above, we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the five years ended December31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 102percent, excluding LUKOIL and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and expropriations.
Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
Controlling costs and expenses.
Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. Operating and overhead costs increased 1 percent in 2011, compared with 2010.
Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars.
We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, construct pipelines and LNG facilities, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We invest in projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time the investment is operational and begins generating financial returns.
The capital expenditures and investments portion of our capital program totaled $13.3 billion in 2011, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $14.8 billion in 2012. The increase reflects our strategic emphasis on delivering value by investing in the most profitable opportunities. We expect competitive returns from increased investments in unconventional resource projects, such as our oil sands business in Canada, liquids-rich shale plays in the U.S. Lower 48 and the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture. As our production profile adjusts over time to reflect our increased levels of investment in liquids plays and lower levels in North American conventional natural gas, we expect higher returns in E&P, absent changes in market factors.
Managing our asset portfolio.
We continually evaluate our assets to determine whether they fit our strategic plans or should be sold or otherwise disposed. As part of our $15$20 billion asset divestiture program for 20102012, during 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude oil 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sands mining operation; our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties, a joint venture which owned and operated Flying J -branded truck and travel plazas; and several E&P properties located in the Lower 48 and western Canada. In 2011, we continued to divest low-return, noncore assets in the Lower 48 and western Canada. We also sold WRG, Seaway Products Pipeline Company, and our equity interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
East Coast refining has been under severe market pressure for several years. As a result, in September2011, we announced our intention to sell the Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, Pennsylvania. The refinery has been idled and will permanently close by the end of the first quarter of 2012 if a sales transaction is unsuccessful. In addition, in E&P we recently entered into agreements to sell our Vietnam business, as well as certain North Sea assets. These sales are expected to close in the first half of 2012.
Developing and retaining a talented work force.
We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical and functional skills.
Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:  Commodity prices . In 2011, the global economic rate of growth slowed, leading to lower oil demand growth. Oil prices, however, increased in 2011, as supply concerns, including concerns over the loss of Libyan production, outweighed the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe. U.S. natural gas prices remained under pressure during 2011, as increased production from shale plays outpaced demand growth. As a result, storage inventory levels reached record highs by the end of 2011. We expect these factors will continue to moderate natural gas prices, resulting in limited U.S. LNG imports in the near- to mid-term.
In recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing in shale natural gas formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted natural gas production in the United States. Although providing short- and long-term significant growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of natural gas due to development of shale plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low natural gas prices; production curtailments on properties that produce primarily natural gas; cancelation or delay of plans to develop Alaska North Slope and Canadian Arctic natural gas fields; and underutilization of LNG regasification facilities and certain natural gas pipelines. Should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced and additional impairments might be possible.
Impairments.
As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive industries. At times, our investments become impaired when, for example, our reserve estimates are revised downward, commodity prices or refining margins decline significantly for long periods of time, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2011 totaled $1.3billion and primarily resulted from the impairments of the Trainer Refinery, our equity investment in Naraynmarneftegaz (NMNG) and certain Canadian natural gas properties. Before-tax impairments in 2010 totaled $2.4billion and primarily related to the $1.5billion property impairment of WRG and the $0.6billion impairment of our equity investment in NMNG.
Effective tax rate . Our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operations.
42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Fiscal and regulatory environment .
Our operations, primarily in E&P, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the United States. Civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments. These changing environments have generally negatively impacted our results of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were temporarily suspended in 2011 during Libyas period of civil unrest. Our assets in Venezuela and Ecuador were expropriated in 2007 and 2009, respectively. In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure in 2009 to tie a component of the new rate to prevailing prices. Our management carefully considers these events when evaluating projects or determining the level of activity in such countries.
Segment Analysis Earnings for the E&P segment are generally closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher in 2011, compared with 2010, averaging $95.05 per barrel in 2011, an increase of 20 percent. Industry natural gas prices at Henry Hub decreased 8percent during 2011 to an average price of $4.04 per million British thermal units.
The Midstream segments results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most important factor affecting the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstreams natural gas liquids prices increased 23 percent in 2011.
Refining margins, refinery capacity utilization and cost control primarily drive the R&M segments results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors over which we have no control. Global refining margins significantly improved during 2011, compared with 2010. The U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread, which is primarily WTI-based, increased 126 percent in 2011, while the N.W. Europe benchmark increased 20percent. The improvement in domestic refining margins primarily resulted from increased production from shale plays and high inventory levels in the Midcontinent area, causing WTI to trade at a deeper discount relative to waterborne crudes for most of 2011. This discount, however, began to narrow toward the end of 2011. During the periods of large WTI-Brent spreads, refineries capable of processing WTI and crude oils that are WTI-based benefitted from the lower regional feedstock prices. In contrast, East Coast refining, which relies primarily on Brent-based crudes, has been under severe market pressure. Product imports, weakness in motor fuel demand, and costly regulatory requirements are key challenges in this difficult environment.
The LUKOIL Investment segment consisted of our prior investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. We disposed of our remaining interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia.
The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of profitability in future years.
Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow. These include commodity prices, production and refining capacity utilization.

The improvement was mainly due to:  Higher commodity prices in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes.
Improved results from our R&M operations, reflecting significantly higher U.S. refining margins.
Lower impairments. In 2011, impairments totaled $1,004 million after-tax, compared with 2010 impairments of $1,928 million after-tax.
These items were partially offset by:  Lower gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales were $1,637 million after-tax, compared with 2010 gains of $4,583 million after-tax.
The absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest.
Lower production volumes from our E&P segment.
2010 vs. 2009 The improved results in 2010 were primarily the result of:  Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and LNG in our E&P segment. Commodity price benefits were somewhat offset by increased production taxes.
Gains of $4,583 million after-tax from asset dispositions and LUKOIL share sales.
Improved results from our domestic R&M operations, reflecting higher refining margins.
These items were partially offset by:  Impairments totaling $1,928 million after-tax.
Lower production volumes from our E&P segment.
44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Statement Analysis 2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 29 percent in 2011, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 37percent. The increases were mainly due to significantly higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGLs.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 30 percent in 2011. The increase primarily resulted from:  Earnings from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3)(QG3), primarily due to sales of LNG following production startup, which occurred in October 2010.
Improved earnings from WRB Refining LP, primarily due to higher refining margins.
Improved earnings from CPChem, mainly due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line.
Lower impairments from NMNG. In 2011, equity earnings included a $395 million impairment of our equity investment, and 2010 equity earnings included a $645 million impairment.
Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership, mostly due to higher commodity prices and volumes.
Improved earnings from DCP Midstream, LLC, mainly as a result of higher NGL prices.
These increases were partially offset by the absence of equity earnings from LUKOIL due to the divestiture of our interest.
Gain on dispositions decreased 65 percent in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of Seaway Products Pipeline Company, our interests in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the remaining divestiture of our LUKOIL shares. These gains were partially offset by the loss on dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent and the loss on disposition of WRG. Gains in 2010 primarily reflected the $2,878million gain realized from the sale of our interest in Syncrude, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note5Assets Held for Sale or Sold and Note 6Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) decreased 12 percent in 2011. The decrease was mostly associated with our E&P segment, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit-of-production rates related to reserve bookings in 2011.
Impairments decreased 56 percent in 2011, primarily due to the $1,514million impairment of WRG in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by the impairment of the Trainer Refinery and various North American E&P natural gas properties in 2011. For additional information, see Note 10Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Taxes other than income taxes increased 9percent in 2011, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales.
Interest and debt expense decreased 18percent in 2011, primarily due to lower debt levels.
See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.
45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2010 vs. 2009 Sales and other operating revenues increased 27 percent in 2010, while purchased crude oil, natural gas and products increased 33 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG.
Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 24 percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from:  Improved earnings from CPChem primarily due to higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line.
Improved earnings from FCCL Partnership due to higher commodity prices and volumes.
Improved earnings from Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) as a result of improved margins and volumes.
These increases were partially offset by a $645 million impairment of our equity investment in NMNG.
Gain on dispositions increased $5,643 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $2,878million gain realized from the Syncrude sale, the $1,749 million gain on the divestiture of our LUKOIL shares, gains on the disposition of certain E&P assets located in the Lower 48 and Canada, and the gain on sale of our 50percent interest in CFJ Properties.
Impairments increased $1,245 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the 2010 WRG impairment.
Taxes other than income taxes increased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher crude oil prices and higher excise taxes on petroleum product sales.
Interest and debt expense decreased 8 percent during 2010, primarily due to lower debt levels.

The E&P segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December31, 2011, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia. Total E&P production averaged 1,619,000 BOED in 2011, compared with 1,752,000BOED in 2010.
48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from our E&P segment were $8,242 million in 2011, a 10 percent decrease compared with earnings of $9,198 million in 2010. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry crude oil and natural gas prices.
U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings were $3,254 million in 2011, an 18 percent increase compared with earnings of $2,768million in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from higher crude oil and NGL prices, and, to a lesser extent, lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by higher production taxes, mainly in Alaska, lower sales volumes, higher operating expenses and lower gains from asset sales in the Lower 48.
U.S. E&P production averaged 653,000 BOED in 2011, a decrease of 5 percent from 686,000BOED in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and asset dispositions, which was partially offset by new production, mostly from the Lower 48.
International E&P International E&P earnings were $4,988 million in 2011, a 22 percent decrease compared with earnings of $6,430 million in 2010. Earnings in 2011 included $316 million in additional income tax expense, as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in July 2011. This additional tax expense consisted of $106million for the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and $210 million to reflect the higher tax rates from the effective date of the legislation, March24, 2011, through December31, 2011. In 2011, earnings also included impairments of our investment in NMNG and various natural gas properties located in Canada, in addition to a $279 million loss on the dilution of our equity interest in APLNG from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. Earnings in 2010 included gains from the sale of Syncrude and certain Canadian properties and an impairment of NMNG. Excluding the impact from these items, earnings increased in 2011, primarily due to higher prices, a full year of LNG sales from QG3 and lower DD&A. These increases to earnings were partially offset by lower volumes and higher taxes.
International E&P production averaged 966,000BOED in 2011, a decrease of 9percent from 1,066,000BOED in 2010. The decrease primarily resulted from suspended operations in Libya and in Bohai Bay, China, asset dispositions and unplanned downtime. Normal field decline was largely offset by new production.
2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from our E&P segment were $9,198 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3,604million in 2009.
U.S. E&P U.S. E&P earnings increased 84 percent in 2010, from $1,503 million in 2009 to $2,768 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Earnings also benefitted from higher gains from asset sales in our Lower 48 portfolio and lower DD&A. These increases were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas volumes, higher production taxes, primarily in Alaska, and an unfavorable tax ruling.
U.S. E&P production averaged 686,000 BOED in 2010, a decrease of 9 percent from 755,000BOED in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime, which was somewhat offset by new production.
49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International E&P International E&P earnings were $6,430 million in 2010, compared with $2,101 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was mostly due to gains from the sale of Syncrude and other assets and higher crude oil, natural gas and LNG prices. These increases were partially offset by the NMNG impairment, lower synthetic oil and natural gas volumes, higher petroleum taxes as a result of higher prices and an $81 million after-tax charge to exploration expenses for project costs resulting from our decision to end participation in the Shah Gas Field Project in Abu Dhabi.
International E&P production averaged 1,066,000BOED in 2010, a decrease of 3percent from 1,099,000BOED in 2009. The decrease was largely due to field decline, the impact of higher prices on production sharing arrangements and the sale of Syncrude. These decreases were partially offset by production from major projects, primarily in China, Canada, Qatar and Australia.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract NGLs from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGLs are fractionatedseparated into individual components like ethane, butane and propaneand marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or refinery blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as wellas our other natural gas gathering and processing operations, and NGL fractionation, trading and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and Trinidad.
2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased 50 percent in 2011, reflecting higher equity earnings from DCP Midstream and improved results from our other Midstream operations. Both DCP Midstream and our equity affiliate in Trinidad benefited from significantly higher NGL prices, which generally tracked the improved crude oil price environment in 2011. Also benefiting 2011 earnings were higher fees received for NGL fractionation services, reflecting favorably renegotiated contracts. These items were partially offset by higher costs at DCP Midstream, primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs and increased DD&A.
50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2010 vs. 2009 Midstream earnings decreased 2 percent in 2010. Higher NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, improved volumes from our equity affiliate in Trinidad, were more than offset by the absence of the 2009 recognition of an $88 million after-tax benefit, which resulted from a DCP Midstream subsidiary converting subordinated units to common units. In addition, higher operating expenses contributed to the decrease in earnings.

51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our R&M segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buys, sells and transports crude oil; and buys, transports, distributes and markets petroleum products. R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.
2011 vs. 2010 R&M reported earnings of $3,751 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $192 million in 2010. See the Business Environment and Executive Overview section for additional information on industry refining margins.
U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $3,595 million in 2011, compared with earnings of $1,022 million in 2010. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and gains from asset sales. In 2011, gains from asset sales of $1,577 million after-tax mainly resulted from the sales of Seaway Products Pipeline Company and our equity investments in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company, while 2010 included the $113 million after-tax gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. These increases were partially offset by the $303 million after-tax impairment and warehouse inventory write-down associated with our Trainer Refinery in 2011.
Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2011, compared with 90percent in 2010. The increase mainly resulted from lower turnaround activity, partially offset by higher planned and unplanned downtime.
International R&M International R&M reported earnings of $156 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $830 million in 2010. The increase in earnings was mostly due to the absence of the 2010 WRG impairment, in addition to higher refining volumes and foreign currency gains in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower refining margins and the $86 million after-tax loss on sale of WRG and related warehouse inventory write-downs in 2011.
Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2011, compared with 56percent in 2010. The increase primarily resulted from the removal of WRG from our refining capacities effective January1, 2011, and lower turnaround activity.
2010 vs. 2009 R&M reported earnings of $192 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $37 million in 2009.
U.S. R&M Earnings from U.S. R&M were $1,022 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $192 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from significantly higher refining margins and the gain on sale of CFJ. Higher refining and marketing volumes also contributed to the improvement in earnings.
Our U.S. refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2010, compared with 87percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 was largely due to lower turnaround activity, lower run reductions due to market conditions, and less unplanned downtime.
International R&M International R&M reported a loss of $830 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $229 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 mainly resulted from the WRG impairment and a $29 million after-tax impairment resulting from our decision to end participation in the Yanbu Refinery Project. Excluding these impairments, earnings were improved due to higher refining margins, partially offset by foreign currency losses.
Our international refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 56 percent in 2010, compared with 74percent in 2009. The 2010 rate primarily reflected run reductions at WRG in response to market conditions.

CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks, to produce plastics and commodity chemicals.
2011 vs. 2010 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased 50 percent in 2011, primarily due to higher margins, volumes and equity earnings in the olefins and polyolefins business line. The specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line also contributed to the increase in earnings due to higher margins.
2010 vs. 2009 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $250 million in 2010, primarily due to substantially higher margins in the olefins and polyolefins business line and, to a lesser extent, improved margins from the specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line. Higher operating costs partially offset these increases.

Activities within this segment are currently focused on power generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels, and the environment.
2011 vs. 2010 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $26 million in 2011, compared with a loss of $59million in 2010. The increase in Power earnings was primarily due to the absence of 2010 impairment charges related to a U.S. cogeneration plant, which was sold in December 2010, combined with higher international power generation results. Higher technology development expenses contributed to the increase in Other losses in 2011.
2010 vs. 2009 The Emerging Businesses segment reported a loss of $59 million in 2010, compared with earnings of $3million in 2009. The decrease in Power earnings was mainly due to higher operating costs and lower margins in international power generation, in addition to the impairment charges and loss on sale of the U.S. cogeneration plant. Higher technology development expenses contributed to the increase in Other losses in 2010.

Net interest decreased 31 percent in 2011, mostly due to lower interest expense, which resulted from lower debt levels; the absence of a $114million after-tax premium on early debt retirement, which occurred in 2010; and slightly higher interest income.
Separation costs consist of expenses incurred for the planned separation of our downstream businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded company, Phillips 66. Expenses incurred in 2011 primarily included legal, accounting and information systems costs.
54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The category Other includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the Other category primarily resulted from foreign currency transaction gains and lower environmental costs, partially offset by a $20 million after-tax property impairment.
2010 vs. 2009 Net interest increased 13 percent in 2010, mostly due to the $114million after-tax premium on early debt retirement and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt levels.
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $101million in 2010, primarily as a result of costs related to compensation and benefit plans.
Changes in the Other category primarily reflected foreign currency transaction losses.

**Includes effect of interest rate swaps.
To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during 2011, we received $4,820 million in proceeds from asset sales. During 2011, the primary uses of our available cash were $13,266million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program; $11,123million to repurchase common stock; $3,632 million to pay dividends on our common stock; and $961million to repay debt. During 2011, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3,674million to $5,780 million.
In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and short-term investment balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Sources of Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL.
Significant Sources of Capital Operating Activities During 2011, cash of $19,646 million was provided by operating activities, a 15 percent increase from cash from operations of $17,045 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices in our E&P segment and higher U.S. refining margins in our R&M segment.
During 2010, cash flow from operations increased $4,566 million, compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher crude oil prices in our E&P segment and higher refining margins in our R&M segment.
While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing margins. Crude oil prices increased in 2009, 2010 and 2011, although natural gas prices remained weak. Global refining margins were under pressure during 2009 and 2010. Domestic refining margins significantly improved during the first three quarters of 2011, followed by a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2011. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The level of our production volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
Our E&P production for 2011 averaged 1.62million BOED. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; timing of project startups and major turnarounds; and weather-related disruptions. Our production in 2012, excluding the impact of any additional dispositions, is expected to be approximately 1.6millionBOED. We continue to evaluate various properties as potential candidates for our disposition program. The makeup and timing of our disposition program will also impact 2012 and future years production levels.
To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. Our total reserve replacement in 2011 was 112 percent, including 117 percent from consolidated operations. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, the reserve replacement was 120percent of 2011 production. Over the five-year period ended December31, 2011, our reserve replacement was 30percent (including 64percent from consolidated operations) reflecting the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL, the expropriation of our assets in Venezuela and the impact of our asset disposition program. Excluding these items and acquisitions, our five-year reserve replacement was 102 percent. The total reserve replacement amount above is based on the sum of our net additions (revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures. For additional information about our proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the Oil and Gas Operations section of this report.
We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base. However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent years.
As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, revisions increased reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
In our R&M segment, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by refining margins.
Asset Sales Proceeds from asset sales in 2011 were $4.8 billion, compared with $15.4 billion in 2010. The 2011 proceeds from asset sales included $2.0 billion from the sale of our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and $1.2 billion from the sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. Other asset sales primarily included mature North American natural gas assets and a products pipeline. We plan to raise an additional $5 billion to $10 billion from asset sales in 2012.
57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. The terms of the new revolving credit facility are similar to the terms of the replaced facility. We also have a $500million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $6.35billion commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. At December31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued at both periods. In addition, under the two ConocoPhillips commercial paper programs, $1,128 million of commercial paper was outstanding at December31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December31, 2011.
Our senior long-term debt is rated A1 by Moodys Investors Service and A by both Standard and Poors Rating Service and by Fitch. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $7.5billion and $500 million revolving credit facilities.
Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.
We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatars North Field. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5percent)and Mitsui& Co., Ltd. (1.5percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. QG3 secured project financing of $4billion in 2005, consisting of $1.3billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5billion from commercial banks, and $1.2billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. At December31, 2011, QG3 had approximately $3.9 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, including $1.2billion owed to ConocoPhillips.

Capital Requirements Our debt balance at December31, 2011, was $22.6billion, a decrease of $1.0billion during 2011, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 26 percent at year-end 2011, versus 25 percent at the end of 2010. The slight increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to a decrease in total equity resulting from the share repurchase programs in 2011, partially offset by the debt reduction. Our debt-to-capital ratio target range is 20 to 25percent.
In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. As part of this transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $732 million was short-term and was included in the Accounts payablerelated parties line on our December31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
During 2011, WRB Refining LP repaid $550 million of loan financing to ConocoPhillips that had been provided to assist WRB in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. No outstanding balance remained at December31, 2011.
In February 2012, we announced a dividend of 66 cents per share. The dividend is payable March1, 2012, to stockholders of record at the close of business February21, 2012.
On March24, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through 2011. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the first quarter of 2011. On February11, 2011, the Board authorized the additional purchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years. Repurchase of shares under this authorization was completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under both programs, repurchases totaled 220million shares at a cost of $15 billion through December31, 2011. On December2, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $10 billion of our common stock over the subsequent two years.

See Note 12Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
(b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.
The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $71,737million. In addition, $50,741 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and natural gas liquids over the remaining term of 88years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining initial term of 14years.
Purchase obligations of $17,044 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.
(c) Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over a six-year period to the FCCL upstream joint venture with Cenovus.
(d) Does not include: Pensionsfor the 2012 through 2016 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $490million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $250million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $690million for 2012 and then approximately $445 million per year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2012 is expected to be $530million in the United States and $220million outside the United States.
60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (e) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $918 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

2012 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET R&Ms 2012 capital expenditures and investments budget is $1.2 billion, a 21percent increase from actual spending in 2011, with about $1.0billion targeted in the United States and $0.2 billion internationally. These funds will be used primarily for projects related to sustaining and improving the existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory compliance, efficiency and reliability.
Emerging Businesses Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ended December31, 2011, was primarily for an expansion and other capital improvements at the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near our Humber Refinery in the United Kingdom.
Contingencies A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Legal and Tax Matters Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
Environmental We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:  U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.
U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.
European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).
U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.
U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.
U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.
These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agencys processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.
An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels that include a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increased requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements.
Another example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas that is otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.
At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as Superfund, the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December31, 2010, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 73 sites around the United States. At December31, 2011, we had been notified of 8 new sites, settled 5 sites and closed 2 sites, bringing the number to 74 unresolved sites with potential liability.
65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
Expensed environmental costs were $1,039million in 2011 and are expected to be about $1,100million per year in 2012 and 2013. Capitalized environmental costs were $573 million in 2011 and are expected to be about $875 million per year in 2012 and 2013.
Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.
Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
At December31, 2011, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $922million, compared with $994million at December31, 2010. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30years.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:  European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.
66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Californias Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of Californias GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020.
Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July1, 2007, with an ultimate reduction target of 12percent of baseline emissions.
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Federal Clean Air Act.
The EPAs announcement on March29, 2010 (published as Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs, 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPAs and U.S. Department of Transportations joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.
Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.
Cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions, including the Australian Clean Energy Legislation which is scheduled to take effect July 2012.
In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed at the end of 2007, with EU ETS Phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission has approved most of the Phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme.
In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:  Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted.
The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).
The GHG reductions required.
The price and availability of offsets.
The amount and allocation of allowances.
Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
Other We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income.
67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
Oil and Gas Accounting Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.
Property Acquisition Costs For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At year-end 2011, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation was $1,880 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was $487million. The weighted-average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately 47percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately fouryears. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2012 would increase by approximately $22million. The remaining $5,966 million of gross capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2011 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $3.0 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas. One of these major assets totaling $97 million is expected to move to proved properties in 2012.
Exploratory Costs For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.
If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area, but 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the projects development economically profitable. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment.
At year-end 2011, total suspended well costs were $1,037million, compared with $1,013million at year-end 2010. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 8Suspended Wells, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Proved Reserves Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a companys E&P operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved. Our reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
Proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and year-end costs. This estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. The estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of DD&A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2011, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $57billion and the DD&A 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recorded on these assets in 2011 was approximately $6.6billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2010 and 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2011. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5percent across all calculations, pretax DD&A in 2011 would have increased by an estimated $347million.
Impairments Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, refining margins and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note 10Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.
Investments innonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity methodare reviewed for impairment whenthere is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions.Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair valueless than the investments carrying amount.Whenit is determined such aloss in valueisother than temporary, an impairment charge is recognizedfor the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value.When determiningwhether a decline in value is other than temporary,managementconsiders factorssuch as thelength of time and extent of the decline, the investees financialcondition and near-term prospects,and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in themarket value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affectthe timing and the amount of animpairment of an investmentin any period.
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued into PP&E at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
Normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to DD&A over the remaining life of the assets. However, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in PP&E due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
In addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
Business Acquisitions Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the recognition of the consideration paid, as well as the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, the asset or liability is recorded at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimates of individual fair values are those involving PP&E and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill At December31, 2011, we had $701 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require managements judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.
At December31, 2011, we had $3,332 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M reporting unit. See Note 9Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on intangibles and goodwill.
Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plan. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $130million, while a 1percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.
71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OUTLOOK Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses On July14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company. The separation is to be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips shareholders on the record date for the share distribution.
In October 2011, we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement with the SEC on November14, 2011, and an amendment on January3, 2012.
The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.
As part of the separation, we expect to receive a cash distribution from Phillips 66. These funds will primarily be used to repay debt, with the balance directed to share repurchases and dividends. In conjunction with the separation, we expect to incur one-time legal, information technology, audit, advisor, and deferred and cash tax costs, resulting in an estimated pre-separation earnings impact of approximately $150 million after-tax, of which $25 million was incurred in 2011.
ChinaBohai Bay On July13, 2011, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) in the Peoples Republic of China instructed us to suspend production from the Peng Lai 19-3 Field Platforms B and C, as a result of two separate seepage incidents which occurred near the platforms. On September2, 2011, the SOA ordered us to halt operations at the Peng Lai 19-3 Field, pending additional cleanup efforts and reservoir depressurization activities to ensure any residual seepage had stopped. The incidents resulted in a total release of approximately 700 barrels of oil into Bohai Bay and approximately 2,600barrels of mineral oil-based drilling mud onto the seafloor. The mineral oil-based drilling mud was recovered and cleaned up from the seafloor. The sources of the seeps have been sealed and containment devices deployed as a preventative measure to capture any residue.
The SOA also required implementation of preventative measures to avoid recurrence, in addition to the filing of an updated environmental impact assessment and development plan for approval. A revised development plan was submitted to Chinas National Development and Reform Commission in November 2011 and is currently under review. A revised environmental impact assessment was submitted to the SOA in February 2012.
The approved depressurization plan, combined with limited development and field optimization, reduced 2011 average daily net production from the field by 14,000barrels of oil per day, compared to 2010 production levels. Future impacts on our business are not known at this time.
In January 2012, we and the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) announced an agreement with Chinas Ministry of Agriculture to resolve fishery-related issues in connection with the seepage incidents. Under this agreement, approximately $160 million will be paid as compensation to settle private claims of potentially affected fishermen in relevant Bohai Bay communities, and public claims for alleged fishery damage. We hold a 49 percent ownership interest in the Peng Lai fields. The agreement fulfills the objectives of the compensation fund we announced in September 2011. As part of this agreement, we have also designated approximately $16 million of our previously announced environmental fund to be used to improve fishery resources and for related projects.

Item7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instrument Market Risk We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.
Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an Authority Limitations document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The senior vice president of Commercial monitors commodity price risk and also reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks related to our upstream and downstream businesses.
Commodity Price Risk We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.
Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives:  Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demands.
Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to floating market prices.
Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions.
Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. We may use derivatives to optimize these activities.
We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December31, 2011, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December31, 2011 and 2010, was immaterial to our consolidated cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December31, 2011 and 2010, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income attributable to ConocoPhillips.
74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The debt portion of the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices. The joint venture acquisition obligation portion of the table presents principal cash flows of the fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation owed to FCCL Partnership. The fair value of the obligation is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at year-end 2011 and 2010 effective yield rates of 1.24percent and 1.87 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of a similar average duration adjusted for ConocoPhillips average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal.

These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The short-cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. These adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps and hedged debt have not been material.
75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these forwards and swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, and since our aggregate position in the forwards was not material, there would be no material impact to our income from an adverse hypothetical 10percent change in the December31, 2011, or 2010, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December31, 2011 and 2010, were as follows: USD00000 USD00000 USD00000 USD00000 In Millions Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives Notional* FairMarketValue** 2011 2010 2011 2010 Sell U.S. dollar, buy euro USD 219 - $ (8 ) - Sell U.S. dollar, buy British pound USD 790 4 - (3 ) Sell U.S. dollar, buy Canadian dollar USD 648 562 - 8 Sell U.S. dollar, buy Norwegian krone USD 292 3 (7 ) - Buy euro, sell the Norwegian krone EUR 3 - - - Sell euro, buy British pound EUR 64 253 5 1 *Denominated in U.S. dollars (USD) and euro (EUR).

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The companys financial statements have been audited by Ernst& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst& Young LLP all of the companys financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders and directors meetings.
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the companys management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on our assessment, we believe the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011.
Ernst& Young LLP has issued an audit report on the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, and their report is included herein.
/s/ James J. Mulva /s/ Jeff W. Sheets James J. Mulva Jeff W. Sheets Chairman, President and Senior Vice President, Finance Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer February21, 2012 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConocoPhillips We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating financial information listed in the Index at Item8 and financial statement schedule listed in Item15(a). These financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ConocoPhillips internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst& Young LLP Houston, Texas February21, 2012 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders ConocoPhillips We have audited ConocoPhillips internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2011 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report dated February21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ConocoPhillips Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1Accounting Policies n Consolidation Principles and Investments Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliates operating and financial policies. When we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, the investment is either classified as available-for-sale if fair value is readily determinable, or the cost method is used if fair value is not readily determinable. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas plants and terminals are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.
n Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in common stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.
n Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
n Revenue Recognition Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids, petroleum and chemical products, and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer, which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry.
Revenues associated with producing properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.
Revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).
n Shipping and Handling Costs Our Exploration and Production (E&P) segment includes shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to E&P marketing activities are recorded in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. The Refining and Marketing (R&M) segment records shipping and handling costs in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as a component of revenue.
n Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
86 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements n Short-Term Investments Investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) with original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year are classified as short-term investments. See Note 16Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts, for additional information on these held-to-maturity financial instruments.
n Inventories We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory. Crude oil and petroleum products inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, consistent with industry practice.
n Fair Value Measurements We categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.
n Derivative Instruments Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity are recognized in other comprehensive income and appear on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will be recognized immediately in earnings.
n Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
Property Acquisition Costs Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment (PP&E). Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and managements judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
Exploratory Costs Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or suspended, on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. For complex 87 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. See Note 8Suspended Wells, for additional information on suspended wells.
Development Costs Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.
Depletion and Amortization Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.
n Capitalized Interest Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.
n Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over their useful lives. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful lives. These indefinite lived intangibles are considered impaired if the fair value of the intangible asset is lower than net book value. The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value of intangible assets is determined based upon the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or upon estimated replacement cost, if expected future cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.
n Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book value of the reporting units assets (including goodwill), less liabilities, then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed on the reporting units assets and liabilities using the fair value of the reporting unit as the purchase price in the calculation. If the amount of goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded amount of goodwill, the recorded goodwill is written down to the new amount. For purposes of goodwill impairment calculations, two reporting units have been determined: Worldwide Exploration and Production and Worldwide Refining and Marketing.
n Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization of PP&E on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other PP&E are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).
n Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment PP&E used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions. If, upon review, the sum of 88 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assetsgenerally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, or at an entire complex level for downstream assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.
The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review. If the future production price risk has been hedged, the hedged price is used in the calculations for the period and quantities hedged. For E&P assets, the impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.
n Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
n Maintenance and Repairs Costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred. Major refinery turnarounds are expensed as incurred.
n Advertising Costs Production costs of media advertising are deferred until the first public showing of the advertisement. Advances to secure advertising slots at specific sporting or other events are deferred until the event occurs. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred, unless the cost has benefits that clearly extend beyond the interim period in which the expenditure is made, in which case the advertising cost is deferred and amortized ratably over the interim periods that clearly benefit from the expenditure.
n Property Dispositions When complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the Gain on dispositions line of our consolidated income statement. When less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.
n Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs The fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. Over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in PP&E is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. For additional information, see Note11Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for additional information.
89 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit. Expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, such as state reimbursement funds, are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.
n Guarantees Fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.
n Stock-Based Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
n Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest expense, and penalties in production and operating expenses.
n Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Excise taxes are reported gross within sales and other operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes, while other sales and value-added taxes are recorded net in taxes other than income taxes.
n Net Income Per Share of Common Stock Basic net income per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not been issued. Diluted net income per share of common stock includes the above, plus unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share. For the purpose of the 2009 earnings per share calculation, net income attributable to ConocoPhillips was reduced by $12 million for the excess of the amount paid for the redemption of a noncontrolling interest over its carrying value, which was charged directly to retained earnings. Treasury stock and shares held by grantor trusts are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations.
90 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Note 2Changes in Accounting Principles Comprehensive Income Effective December31, 2011, we early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This ASU amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, by requiring a more prominent presentation of the components of other comprehensive income. We elected the two-statement approach presenting other comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following the income statement. On December23, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No.2011-05. ASU 2011-12 defers the ASU 2011-05 requirement to present items reclassified into net income from other comprehensive income. This deferral only impacted the presentation requirement on the consolidated income statement.
Note 3Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) We hold variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not considered the primary beneficiary. Information on our significant VIE follows: We have an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in an LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we own a 50percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc. (Freeport GP), which serves as the general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. Freeport LNG began making loan repayments in September 2008, and the loan balance outstanding as of December31, 2011, was $612million. Freeport LNG is a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG, and the limited partners of Freeport LNG do not have any substantive decision making ability. We performed an analysis of the expected losses and determined we are not the primary beneficiary. This expected loss analysis took into account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to maintain sufficient commercial insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is accounted for as a financial asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity investment.
91 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Note 4Inventories Inventories at December31 were: MillionsofDollars 2011 2010 Crude oil and petroleum products $ 3,633 4,254 Materials, supplies and other 998 943 $ 4,631 5,197 Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled $3,387 million and $4,051million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The estimated excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted to approximately $8,400million and $6,800 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased net income attributable to ConocoPhillips $160 million, of which $155 million was attributable to the R&M segment.
Note 5Assets Held for Sale or Sold In December 2011, we sold our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. The total carrying value of these assets, which were included in our R&M segment, was $348million, which included $104 million of investment in equity affiliates and $244 million of allocated goodwill. The $1,661 million before-tax gain on these dispositions was included in the Gain on dispositions line in the consolidated income statement.
In June 2010, we sold our 9.03 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture for $4.6 billion. The $2.9 billion before-tax gain was included in the Gain on dispositions line of our consolidated income statement. At the time of disposition, Syncrude had a net carrying value of $1.75 billion, which included $1.97billion of PP&E, and was included in the E&P segment.
In February 2012, we signed definitive agreements to sell our Vietnam E&P business for $1.29 billion, excluding customary working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012. At December31, 2011, this business had a net carrying value of approximately $150 million, which included PP&E of $350million.

Summarized 100percent financial information for equity method investments in affiliated companies, combined, was as follows (information includes LUKOIL until loss of significant influence): Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 77,263 105,589 128,881 Income before income taxes 11,958 11,250 12,121 Net income 11,089 9,495 9,145 Current assets 21,530 14,039 36,139 Noncurrent assets 76,300 79,411 126,163 Current liabilities 9,708 9,325 22,483 Noncurrent liabilities 22,993 24,412 30,960 Our share of income taxes incurred directly by the equity companies is reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
At December31, 2011, retained earnings included $2,814million related to the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies. Dividends received from affiliates were $3,670 million, $2,282 million and $1,727million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
APLNG In 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. APLNG is focused on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. This transaction gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG position with the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets. Origin is the operator of APLNGs production and pipeline system, while we will operate the LNG facility.
In April 2011, APLNG and Sinopec signed definitive agreements for APLNG to supply up to 4.3million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. The agreements also specified terms under which Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in APLNG, with both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest diluting to 42.5percent. The Subscription Agreement was completed in August 2011, and we recorded a loss on disposition of $279 million before- and after-tax from the dilution. The book value of our investment in APLNG was reduced by $795 million, and we reduced the currency translation adjustment associated with our investment by $516 million.
93 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In November 2011, APLNG signed a binding Heads of Agreement with Japan-based Kansai Electric for the sale of approximately 1million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Kansai Electric will be supplied LNG beginning in mid-2016. The agreement is also subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train, which is expected in the first half of 2012.
In January 2012, APLNG and Sinopec signed an amendment to their existing LNG sales agreement for the sale and purchase of an additional 3.3million tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, subject to a final investment decision on the second LNG train. This agreement, in combination with the Kansai Electric agreement, finalizes the marketing of the second train. In conjunction with the LNG sale, the parties have also agreed for Sinopec to subscribe for additional shares in APLNG, which will raise its equity interest from 15percent to 25percent. As a result, both our ownership interest and Origin Energys ownership interest would dilute from 42.5 percent to 37.5 percent. We expect to record a loss of approximately $135 million after-tax from the dilution.
At December31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in APLNG was $9,467million, which includes $2,716 million of cumulative translation effects due to a strengthening Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. Our 42.5percent share of the historical cost basis net assets of APLNG on its books under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles was $2,380 million, resulting in a basis difference of $7,087million on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis difference, $5,192 million associated with PP&E, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to individual exploration and production license areas owned by APLNG, most of which are not currently in production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization. As the joint venture begins producing natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net income attributable to ConocoPhillips for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was after-tax expense of $17million, $5 million and $4million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis difference on currently producing licenses.
FCCL and WRB We have two 50/50 North American heavy oil business ventures with Cenovus Energy Inc.: FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, and WRB Refining LP, a U.S. downstream limited partnership. We use the equity method of accounting for both entities, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL reflecting the use of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.
At December31, 2011, the book value of our investment in FCCL was $9,044 million. FCCLs operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in northeastern Alberta. Cenovus is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period that began in 2007. For additional information on this obligation, see Note 13Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation.
At December31, 2011, the book value of our investment in WRB was $3,722 million. WRBs operating assets consist of the Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. As a result of our contribution of these two assets to WRB, a basis difference was created due to the fair value of the contributed assets recorded by WRB exceeding their historical book value. The difference is primarily amortized and recognized as a benefit evenly over a period of 26 years, which was the estimated remaining useful life of the refineries PP&E at the closing date. The basis difference at December31, 2011, was $3,918 million. Equity earnings in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were increased by $185million, $243 million and $209 million, respectively, due to amortization of the basis difference. We are the operator and managing partner of WRB. Cenovus is obligated to contribute $7.5billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period that began in 2007.
QG3 QG3 is a joint venture that owns an integrated large-scale LNG project located in Qatar. We provided project financing, with a current outstanding balance of $1,159 million as described below under Loans and Long-term Receivables. At December31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in QG3 was 94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $931million. We have terminal and pipeline use agreements with Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline near Port Arthur, Texas, in which we have a 12.4 percent interest, intended to provide us with terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of LNG purchased from QG3. However, currently the LNG from QG3 is being sold to markets outside of the United States.
DCP Midstream DCP Midstream owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants. At December31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in DCP Midstream was $927million. DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply agreement that continues at the current volume commitment with a primary term ending December31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an if-produced, will-purchase basis and so has no fixed production schedule, but has had, and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a relatively stable purchase pattern. Natural gas liquids are purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less transportation and fractionation fees.
CPChem CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December31, 2011, the book value of our equity method investment in CPChem was $2,998 million. We have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem, ranging in initial terms from one to 99years, with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, and are generally on an if-produced, will-purchase basis. All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices.
In anticipation of the separation of our downstream businesses (including CPChem), we reached agreement with Chevron Corporation regarding CPChem that provides for CPChem to: (i)prior to the separation, suspend all cash distributions to its owners and accumulate its excess cash; and (ii)after the separation, use the accumulated cash and its excess cash flow to pay down $1 billion of its outstanding fixed-rate bonds on an accelerated basis. During this period of bond repayment, CPChem is not required to make any cash distributions to its owners.
LUKOIL LUKOIL is an integrated energy company headquartered in Russia. We completed the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL during the first quarter of 2011, realizing a before-tax gain of $360 million, which was included in the Gain on dispositions line of our consolidated income statement, and cash proceeds of $1,243million. Our ownership interest was 2.25percent at December31, 2010, and 20 percent at December31, 2009.
On July28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL, then consisting of 163.4million shares. This decision was implemented as follows:  On July28, 2010, we entered into a stock purchase and option agreement (the Agreement) with a wholly owned subsidiary of LUKOIL, pursuant to which such subsidiary purchased 64.6millionshares from us at a price of $53.25 per share, or $3,442 million in total. This transaction closed on August16, 2010.
Also pursuant to the Agreement, the LUKOIL subsidiary had a 60-day option, expiring on September26, 2010, to purchase any or all of our interest remaining at the time of exercise of the option, at a price of $56 per share. Upon exercise of this option, we sold 42.5millionshares on September29, 2010, for proceeds of $2,380 million.
Finally, we sold our remaining shares in the open market subject to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, with the final disposition of all shares occurring in the first quarter of 2011. The cost basis for shares sold was average cost.
95 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During the third quarter of 2010, our ownership interest declined to a level at which we were no longer able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of 2010, we stopped applying the equity method of accounting for our remaining investment in LUKOIL, and we reclassified the investment from Investments and long-term receivables to current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as an available-for-sale equity security.
In total, during 2010, we sold 151million shares of LUKOIL for $8,345 million, realizing a before-tax gain on disposition of $1,749 million, which was included in the Gain on dispositions line of our consolidated income statement. Included in these amounts were sales proceeds of $1,793 million and a realized before-tax gain of $437million incurred subsequent to classifying the investment as available-for-sale. The cost basis for shares sold is average cost.
At December31, 2010, our then remaining investment in LUKOIL was carried at fair value of $1,083million, reflecting a closing price of LUKOIL American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50 per share. The carrying value reflected a pre-tax unrealized gain over our cost basis of $247million. This unrealized gain, net of related income taxes, was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value was categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
While applying the equity method of accounting, a negative basis difference existed which was primarily amortized on a straight-line basis over a 22-year useful life as an increase to equity earnings. Equity earnings in 2010 and 2009 were increased $155 million and $157 million, respectively, due to amortization of this basis difference.
Loans and Long-term Receivables As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities. Included in such activity are loans and long-term receivables to certain affiliated and non-affiliated companies. Loans are recorded when cash is transferred or seller financing is provided to the affiliated or non-affiliated company pursuant to a loan agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan agreements stated interest rate. Loans and long-term receivables are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan balance may not be fully recovered.
At December31, 2011, significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:  $612 million in loan financing to Freeport LNG Development, L.P. for the construction of an LNG receiving terminal that became operational in June 2008. Freeport began making repayments in 2008 and is required to continue making repayments through full repayment of the loan in 2026. Repayment by Freeport is supported by process-or-pay capacity service payments made by us to Freeport under our terminal use agreement.
$1,159 million in project financing to QG3. We own a 30 percent interest in QG3, for which we use the equity method of accounting. The other participants in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum and Mitsui. QG3 secured project financing of $4.0billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. On December15, 2011, QG3 achieved financial completion and all project loan facilities became nonrecourse to the project participants. Bi-annual repayments began in January 2011 and will extend through July 2022.
The long-term portion of these loans are included in the Loans and advancesrelated parties line on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is in Accounts and notes receivablerelated parties.
WRB Refining LP fully repaid its outstanding loans from us with payments of $550 million in 2011.
96 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In November 2011, a long-term loan to a non-affiliated company related to seller financing of U.S. retail marketing assets was refinanced, which resulted in a receipt of $365 million. As part of the refinancing, we provided loan guarantees in support of $191 million of the total refinancing.
Long-term receivables and the long-term portion of these loans are included in the Investments and long-term receivables line on the consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion related to non-affiliate loans is in Accounts and notes receivable.
Other We have investments remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis to support certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair value of these assets at December31, 2011, was $336million, and at December31, 2010, was $325million. Substantially the entire value is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from national securities exchanges.
Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) owns a delayed coker and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery. MSLP processes our long residue, which is produced from heavy sour crude oil, for a processing fee. Fuel-grade petroleum coke is produced as a by-product and becomes the property of MSLP. Prior to August28, 2009, MSLP was owned 50/50 by us and Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Under the agreements that govern the relationships between the partners, certain defaults by PDVSA with respect to supply of crude oil to the Sweeny Refinery gave us the right to acquire PDVSAs 50percent ownership interest in MSLP, which we exercised on August28, 2009. PDVSA has initiated arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce challenging the exercise of the call right and claiming it was invalid. The arbitral tribunal is scheduled to hold hearings on the merits of the dispute in December 2012. We continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in MSLP.
Note 7Properties, Plants and Equipment PP&E is recorded at cost. Within the E&P segment, depreciation is mainly on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by field. In the R&M segment, investments in refining manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life, and pipeline assets over a 45-year life. The companys investment in PP&E, with accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (Accum. DD&A), at December31 was: Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 Gross PP&E Accum.

Amortization expense was not material for 2011 and 2010, and is not expected to be material in future years.
Note 10Impairments During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges: Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 E&P United States $ 72 25 5 International 216 56 463 R&M United States 470 52 63 International 2 1,616 3 Emerging Businesses - 31 - Corporate 32 - 1 $ 792 1,780 535 100 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2011 In 2011, we recorded a $467 million impairment of our refinery and associated pipelines and terminals in Trainer, Pennsylvania. In September 2011, we announced plans to seek a buyer for the refinery and have idled the facility. If unable to sell the refinery, we expect to permanently close the plant by the end of the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we recorded property impairments of $288 million in our E&P segment, primarily as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions and reduced volume forecasts.
2010 During 2010, we recorded a $1,514 million impairment of our refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, due to canceled plans for a project to upgrade the refinery, as well as a $98 million impairment as a result of our decision to end our participation in a new refinery project in Yanbu Industrial City, Saudi Arabia. We also recorded various property impairments of $81 million in our E&P segment.
2009 During 2009, we recorded property impairments of $417 million in our E&P segment, primarily as a result of lower natural gas price assumptions, reduced volume forecasts, and higher royalty, operating costs and capital expenditure assumptions. Additionally, we recorded a noncash charge of $51million before- and after-tax related to the full impairment of our exploration and production investments in Ecuador, due to their expropriation.An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011, and the arbitration process is ongoing. Property impairments of $66 million in our R&M segment, primarily associated with planned asset dispositions, were also recorded during 2009.
Fair Value Remeasurements The following table shows the values of assets, by major category, measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition: Millions of Dollars FairValue MeasurementsUsing FairValue * Level1 Inputs Level3 Inputs Before-Tax Loss Year ended December31, 2011 Net PP&E (held for use) $ 162 - 162 265 Equity method investments 274 - 274 399 Cost method investments 2 2 - 8 Year ended December31, 2010 Net PP&E (held for use) $ 307 - 307 1,604 ** Net PP&E (held for sale) 23 5 18 43 Equity method investments 735 - 735 645 * Represents the fair value at the time of the impairment.
** Includes a $55 million leasehold impairment charged to exploration expenses.
2011 During 2011, net PP&E held for use with a carrying amount of $427 million was written down to a fair value of $162 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $265 million. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar assets and alternative use.
Also during 2011, certain equity method investments were determined to have fair values below their carrying amount, and the impairments were considered to be other than temporary. This primarily included an investment associated with our E&P segment with a book value of $651 million, which was written down to its fair value of $256million, resulting in a charge of $395million before-tax. This was included in the Equity in earnings of affiliates line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a 101 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain similar undeveloped properties.
2010 During 2010, net PP&E held for use with a carrying amount of $1,911million was written down to a fair value of $307 million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $1,604 million. The fair values were determined by the use of internal discounted cash flow models using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and cash flow multiples for similar assets and alternative use.
Also during 2010, net PP&E held for sale with a carrying amount of $64million was written down to a fair value of $23 million less cost to sell of $2 million for a net $21million, resulting in a before-tax loss of $43 million. The fair values were primarily determined by binding negotiated selling prices with third parties, with some adjusted for the fair value of certain liabilities retained.
In addition, an equity method investment associated with our E&P segment was determined to have a fair value below carrying amount, and the impairment was considered to be other than temporary. This investment with a book value of $1,380 million was written down to its fair value of $735million, resulting in a charge of $645million before-tax, which was included in the Equity in earnings of affiliates line of our consolidated income statement. The fair value was determined by the application of an internal discounted cash flow model using estimates of future production, prices, costs and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. In addition, the equity investment fair value was determined by the comparison of market data for certain similar undeveloped properties.
Note 11Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December31 were: MillionsofDollars 2011 2010 Asset retirement obligations $ 8,920 8,776 Accrued environmental costs 922 994 Total asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs 9,842 9,770 Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs due within one year* (513 ) (571 ) Long-term asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs $ 9,329 9,199 * Classified as a current liability on the balance sheet, under the caption Other accruals.
Asset Retirement Obligations We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.
We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries.
102 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2011 and 2010, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows: MillionsofDollars 2011 2010 Balance at January1 $ 8,776 8,295 Accretion of discount 435 422 New obligations 153 64 Changes in estimates of existing obligations 29 744 Spending on existing obligations (327 ) (314 ) Property dispositions (60 ) (394 ) Foreign currency translation (86 ) (41 ) Balance at December31 $ 8,920 8,776 Accrued Environmental Costs Total accrued environmental costs at December31, 2011 and 2010, were $922 million and $994million, respectively. The 2011 decrease in total accrued environmental costs is due to payments and settlements during the year exceeding new accruals, accrual adjustments and accretion.
We had accrued environmental costs of $571million and $624million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $274million and $278million of environmental costs associated with nonoperator sites at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, $77million and $92 million were included at both December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.
Because a large portion of the accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected expenditures for acquired environmental obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $427 million at December31, 2011. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $58million in 2012, $44million in 2013, $22 million in 2014, $19 million in 2015, $20 million in 2016, and $373million for all future years after2016.

At December31, 2011, we classified $1,058 million of short-term debt as long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facilities.
During 2011, the following debt instruments were repaid at their maturity:  The $328 million 9.375% Debentures due 2011.
The $500 million 6.50% Notes due 2011.
In August 2011, we increased our revolving credit facilities from $7.85 billion to $8.0 billion by replacing our $7.35billion revolving credit facility with a $7.5 billion facility expiring in August 2016. We also have a $500million facility expiring in July 2012. Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, or as support for our commercial paper programs. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
We have two commercial paper programs: the ConocoPhillips $6.35 billion program, primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5billion commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the QG3 Project. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At both December31, 2011 and 2010, we had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under the two commercial paper programs, there was $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2011, compared with $1,182 million at December31, 2010. Since we had $1,128 million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued $40million of letters of credit, we had access to $6.8 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities at December31, 2011.
Note 13Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation In 2007, we closed on a business venture with Cenovus. As a part of the transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period that began in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Partnership, formed as a result of the transaction.
Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, $732 million was short-term and was included in the Accounts payablerelated parties line on our December31, 2011, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $695 million in 2011, is included in the Other line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payment is reflected as a capital contribution and is included in the Capital expenditures and investments line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.
105 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Note 14Guarantees At December31, 2011, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were issued prior to December31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
Construction Completion Guarantees In December 2005, we issued a construction completion guarantee for 30percent of the $4billion in loan facilities of QG3, which are being used to finance the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. Of the $4billion in loan facilities, we committed to provide $1.2billion. Effective December15, 2011, the project achieved financial completion, the financing became nonrecourse to ConocoPhillips and our guarantee was released.
Guarantees of Joint Venture Debt At December31, 2011, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 24 years. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is approximately $100 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations.
Other Guarantees  In conjunction with our purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy in October 2008, we agreed to participate, if and when requested, in any parent company guarantees that were outstanding at the time we purchased our interest in APLNG. These parent company guarantees cover the obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements with remaining terms of 5 to 20 years. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $1,261 million ($2,820 million in the event of intentional or reckless breach) at December 2011 exchange rates based on our 42.5 percent share of the remaining contracted volumes, which could become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG. Additionally, we have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain contracts executed in connection with APLNGs issuance of the Train 1 Notice to Proceed. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is estimated to be $171million at December 2011 exchange rates based on our 42.5 percent ownership in APLNG.
We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling $450million, which consist primarily of guarantees to fund the short-term cash liquidity deficits of certain joint ventures, a guarantee of minimum charter revenue for two LNG vessels, one small construction completion guarantee, guarantees relating to the startup of a refining joint venture, guarantees of the lease payment obligations of a joint venture, guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate aircraft, and guarantees of the performance of a business partner or some of its customers. These guarantees generally extend up to 13years or life of the venture.
Indemnifications Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated with these sales include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary greatly. The 106 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December31, 2011, was $362 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the recorded carrying amount were $218million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December31, 2011. For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 15Contingencies and Commitments.
Note 15Contingencies and Commitments A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against ConocoPhillips that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See Note 20Income Taxes, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Environmental We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on managements best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies cleanup experience, and data released by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, 107 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings. See Note 11Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.
Legal Proceedings Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
Other Contingencies We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December31, 2011, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $1,954 million(of which $40 million was issued under the provisions of our revolving credit facility, and the remainder was issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and items of permanent investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
In 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration to an empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan governments Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuelas national oil company, PDVSA,or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, we filed a request for international arbitration on November2, 2007, with the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). An arbitration hearing was held before an ICSID tribunal during the summer of 2010, and we are currently awaiting an interim decision on key legal and factual issues. A separate arbitration hearing was held in January 2012 before the International Chamber of Commerce on ConocoPhillips separate claims against PDVSA for certain breaches of their Association Agreements prior to the expropriation.
In 2008, Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, initiated arbitration before ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador, as a result of the newly enacted Windfall Profits Tax Law and government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts. Despite a restraining order issued by ICSID, Ecuador confiscated the crude oil production of Burlington and its co-venturer and sold the illegally seized crude oil.In 2009, Ecuador took over operations in Blocks 7 and 21, fully expropriating our assets. In June 2010, the ICSID tribunal concluded it has jurisdiction to hear the expropriation claim. An arbitration hearing on case merits occurred in March 2011. On September30, 2011, Ecuador filed a supplemental counterclaim asserting environmental damages, which we believe will not be material. The arbitration process is ongoing. For additional information, see Note 10Impairments.
108 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements in support of financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of the companys business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements are: 2012$468 million; 2013$467 million; 2014$467 million; 2015$458 million; 2016$364million; and 2017 and after$4,890 million. Totalpayments under the agreements were $429million in 2011, $216million in 2010 and $114million in 2009.
Note 16Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts Financial Instruments We invest excess cash in financial instruments with maturities based on our cash forecasts for the various currency pools we manage. The maturities of these investments may from time to time extend beyond 90days. The types of financial instruments in which we currently invest include:  Time Deposits: Interest bearing deposits placed with approved financial institutions.
Commercial Paper: Unsecured promissory notes issued by a corporation, commercial bank, or government agency purchased at a discount, maturing at par.
Government or government agency obligations: Negotiable debt obligations issued by a government or government agency.
These financial instruments appear in the Cash and cash equivalents line of our consolidated balance sheet if the maturities at the time we made the investments were 90 days or less; otherwise, these held-to-maturity investments are included in the Short-term investments line. At December31, we held the following financial instruments: Millions of Dollars Carrying Amount CashandCashEquivalents Short-TermInvestments* 2011 2010 2011 2010 Cash $ 1,169 1,284 - - Time Deposits Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days 4,318 6,154 349 302 Remaining maturities from 91 to 180 days - - - 69 Commercial Paper Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days 293 1,566 232 525 Remaining maturities from 91 to 180 days - - - - Government Obligations Remaining maturities from 1 to 90 days - 450 - 77 Remaining maturities from 91 to 180 days - - - - $ 5,780 9,454 581 973 * Carrying value approximates fair value.
Derivative Instruments We use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, or to capture market opportunities. Since we are not currently using cash-flow hedge accounting, all gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from derivative contracts have been recognized in the consolidated income statement. Gains and losses from derivative contracts held for trading not directly related to our physical business, whether realized or unrealized, have been reported net in other income.
Purchase and sales contracts with fixed minimum notional volumes for commodities that are readily convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas and gasoline) are recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives 109 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements unless the contracts are eligible for and we elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception (i.e.,contracts to purchase or sell quantities we expect to use or sell over a reasonable period in the normal course of business). We record most of our contracts to buy or sell natural gas and the majority of our contracts to sell power as derivatives, but we do apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception to certain long-term contracts to sell our natural gas production. We generally apply this normal purchases and normal sales exception to eligible crude oil and refined product commodity purchase and sales contracts; however, we may elect not to apply this exception (e.g., when another derivative instrument will be used to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sales contract but hedge accounting will not be applied, in which case both the purchase or sales contract and the derivative contract mitigating the resulting risk will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value).
We value our exchange-traded derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date, and these are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Where exchange-provided prices are adjusted, non-exchange quotes are used, or when the instrument lacks sufficient liquidity, we generally classify those exchange-cleared contracts as Level 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps and physical commodity forward purchase and sales contracts are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers and price index developers, such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are classified as Level2. In certain less liquid markets or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC swaps and physical commodity purchase and sales contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships among various commodities that result in managements best estimate of fair value. These contracts are classified as Level 3. A contract that is initially classified as Level 3 due to absence or insufficient corroboration of broker quotes over a material portion of the contract will transfer to Level 2 when the portion of the trade having no quotes or insufficient corroboration becomes an insignificant portion of the contract. A contract would also transfer to Level 2 if we began using a corroborated broker quote that has become available. Conversely, if a corroborated broker quote ceases to be available or used by us, the contract would transfer from Level 2 to Level 3. There were no material transfers in or out of Level 1.
Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the options are classified as Level 2 or 3.
We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices). When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations, generally based on available market evidence.

Gains or losses from contracts in one level may be offset by gains or losses on contracts in another level or by changes in values of physical contracts or positions that are not reflected in the table above.
As reflected in the table above, Level 3 activity was not material.
Commodity Derivative Contracts We operate in the worldwide crude oil, bitumen, refined product, natural gas, LNG, natural gas liquids and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, we use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to balance physical systems, meet customer needs, manage price exposures on specific transactions, and do a limited, immaterial amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. We also use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be used to optimize these activities which may move our risk profile away from market average prices.
The fair value of commodity derivative assets and liabilities and the line items where they appear on our consolidated balance sheet were: MillionsofDollars 2011 2010 Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 4,433 3,073 Other assets 415 211 Liabilities Other accruals 4,350 3,212 Other liabilities and deferred credits 374 193 Hedge accounting has not been used for any item in the table.

Hedge accounting has not been used for any item in the table.
111 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The table below summarizes our material net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative contracts. These financial and physical derivative contracts are primarily used to manage price exposures on our underlying operations. The underlying exposures may be from non-derivative positions such as inventory volumes or firm natural gas transport contracts. Financial derivative contracts may also offset physical derivative contracts, such as forward sales contracts.

These swaps qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting. The short-cut method permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.
The adjustments to the fair values of the interest rate swaps and hedged debt have not been material.
Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.

Credit Risk Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, OTC derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds, government debt securities and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.
The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due us.
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December31, 2011, was $237 million, for which $3 million of collateral was posted. If our credit rating were lowered one level from its A rating (per Standard and Poors) on December31, 2011, we would be required to post no additional collateral to our counterparties. If we were downgraded below investment grade, we would be required to post $234 million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
113 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair Values of Financial Instruments We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Accounts and notes receivable: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Investment in LUKOIL shares: We completed the disposition of our interest in LUKOIL during the first quarter of 2011. At December31, 2010, our investment in LUKOIL was carried at fair value of $1,083 million, reflecting a closing price of LUKOIL ADRs on the London Stock Exchange of $56.50per share.
Debt: The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is estimated based on quoted market prices.
Fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation: Fair value is estimated based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at December31, 2011, and December31, 2010, using effective yield rates of 1.24percent and 1.87 percent, respectively, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of similar average duration adjusted for our average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the obligation principal. See Note 13Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for additional information.
Commodity swaps: Fair value is estimated based on forward market prices and approximates the exit price at period end. When forward market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using the forward prices of a similar commodity with adjustments for differences in quality or location.
Futures: Fair values are based on quoted market prices obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) Futures, or other traded exchanges.
Interest rate swap contracts: Fair value is estimated based on a pricing model and market-observable interest rate swap curves obtained from a third-party market data provider.
Forward-exchange contracts: Fair values are estimated by comparing the contract rate to the forward rates in effect at the end of the respective reporting periods, and approximate the exit prices at those dates.

In addition, the December31, 2011, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of no obligations to return cash collateral and $244million of rights to reclaim cash collateral. The December31, 2010, commodity derivative assets and liabilities appear net of $5 million of obligations to return cash collateral and $324million of rights to reclaim cash collateral, respectively. No collateral was deposited or held for the foreign currency derivatives or interest rate derivatives.

Noncontrolling Interests At December31, 2011 and 2010, we had outstanding $510 million and $547 million, respectively, of equity in less-than-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling interest owners. The noncontrolling interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $482 million and $520 million at December31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, was related to Darwin LNG operations, located in Australias Northern Territory.
Preferred Share Purchase Rights In 2002, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the issuance of one right per common share for any newly issued shares. The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire ConocoPhillips on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed or otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquirer obtaining beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips common stock, the rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors prior to that occurrence. The rights, which expire June30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the companys common stock or commences a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock. Each right would entitle stockholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of $300. If an acquirer obtains 15percent or more of ConocoPhillips common stock, then each right will be adjusted so that it will entitle the holder (other than the acquirer, whose rights will become void) to purchase, for the then exercise price, a number of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock equal in value to two times the exercise price of the right. In addition, the rights enable holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a discount, depending on specific circumstances. We may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, for one cent per right.

None were recognized in 2010.
We recognized special termination benefits of $5million in 2009. None were recognized in 2011 and 2010.
In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. For net actuarial gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized balance each year.
We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 7.75percent in 2012 that declines to 5percent by 2023. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would be immaterial to ConocoPhillips.
Plan Assets We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings. As a result, our plan assets have no significant concentrations of credit risk. Asset classes that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment program from time to time. The target allocations for plan assets are 56percent equity securities, 35 percent debt securities, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent in all other types of investments. Generally, the investments in the plans are publicly traded, therefore minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December31, 2011 and 2010.
Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level1 are primarily based on quoted market prices.
Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and market price quotations. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair market value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
Fair values of mutual funds are valued based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates.
Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party sources.
Private equity funds are valued at net asset value as determined by the issuer based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
120 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements  Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the Plans participants.
Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract. This participating interest is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The participation interest is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a combination of comparison to quoted market prices and estimation using recently executed transactions and market price quotations for contract assets, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations. At December31, 2011, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $144 million and consisted of $391 million in debt securities, less $247 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December31, 2010, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $92 million and consisted of $357million in debt securities, less $265million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The net change from 2010 to 2011 is due to an increase in the fair market value of the underlying investments of $34million and a decrease in the present value of the contract obligation of $18 million. The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

As reflected in the table above, Level 3 activity was not material.
122 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2012, we expect to contribute approximately $690million to our domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans and $235million to our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Employees can deposit up to 75 percent of their eligible pay up to the statutory limit ($16,500 in 2011) in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 39 investment funds. ConocoPhillips matches contribution deposits, up to 1.25percent of eligible pay. Company contributions charged to expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below), were $25 million in 2011, $24million in 2010, and $23 million in 2009.
The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to the amount of contribution.
In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSPs borrowings, the unpaid balance is reported as a liability of the company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common stockholders equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2012 through 2014, when no debt principal payments are scheduled to occur, we have committed to make direct contributions of stock to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to ensure a certain minimum level of stock allocation to participant accounts.
We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to the stock savings feature of $77million, $92million and $83million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, all of which was compensation expense. In 2011, we made cash contributions to the CPSP of $4 million. No cash contributions were made in 2010 and 2009. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we contributed 660,755 shares,1,776,873 shares and 2,018,692shares, respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust. The shares had a fair market value of $84million, $103million and $94million, respectively. Also in 2011, we contributed 475,696 shares of company common stock from Treasury stock. Dividends used to service debt were $45million, $41million and $39million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1 million, $2million and $2million, respectively.
123 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December31 were: 2011 2010 Unallocated shares 811,963 3,385,778 Allocated shares 19,315,372 19,198,502 Total shares 20,127,335 22,584,280 The fair value of unallocated shares at December31, 2011 and 2010, was $59 million and $231million, respectively.
We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense recognized for these international plans was approximately $56 million in 2011, $52 million in 2010 and $51 million in 2009.
Share-Based Compensation Plans The 2011 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan of ConocoPhillips (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2011. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 100million shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and consultants; however, as of the effective date of the Plan, (i)any shares of common stock available for future awards under the prior plans and (ii)any shares of common stock represented by awards granted under the prior plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of shares of common stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of common stock back to the company shall be available for awards under the Plan, and no new awards shall be granted under the prior plans. Of the 100million shares available for issuance under the Plan, no more than 40million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options, and no more than 40million shares are available for awards in stock.
Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement. For share-based awards granted prior to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), codified into FASB ASC Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation, we recognize expense over the period of time during which the employee earns the award, accelerating the recognition of expense only when an employee actually retires. For share-based awards granted after our adoption of ASC 718 on January1, 2006, we recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture.
Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). For awards granted prior to our adoption of ASC 718 that vest ratably, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for each separate vesting portion of the award (i.e., as if the award was multiple awards with different requisite service periods). For share-based awards granted after our adoption of ASC 718, we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
124 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income and the associated tax benefit for the years ended December31, were as follows: Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Compensation cost $ 246 211 121 Tax benefit 86 78 42 Stock Options Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10years and generally vest ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Options awarded to employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end of the normal vesting period.

During 2011, we received $197 million in cash and realized a tax benefit of $119 million from the exercise of options. At December31, 2011, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from unvested options was $16 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 19 months, the longest period being 25months.

We periodically calculate the average period of time lapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants to estimate the expected life of new option grants.
Stock Unit Program Generally, restricted stock units are granted annually under the provisions of the Plan and vest ratably, with one-third of the units vesting in 36 months, one-third vesting in 48 months, and the final third vesting 60 months from the date of grant. In addition to these regularly scheduled annual awards, restricted stock units are also granted ad hoc to attract or retain key personnel, and the terms and conditions under which these restricted stock units vest vary by award. Upon vesting, the units are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to employees already eligible for retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those units are not issued as shares until the end of the normal vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the units receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. The grant date fair value of these units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net present value of the dividends that will not be received.

Performance Share Program Under the Plan, we also annually grant to senior management restricted performance share units (PSUs) that do not vest until either (i)with respect to awards for performance periods beginning before 2009, the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service or (ii)with respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009, five years after the grant date of the award (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until retirement after reaching age 55 with five years of service), so we recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date the PSUs are scheduled to vest. Since these awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for such retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. These PSUs are settled by issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Until issued as stock, recipients of the PSUs receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. In its current form, the first grant of PSUs under this program was in 2006.

Other  In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.

Compensation and Benefits Trust The Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT) was an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an independent trustee and designed to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund certain future compensation and benefit obligations of the company. The trustee voted shares held by the CBT in accordance with voting directions from eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement with the trustee. We sold 58.4million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the CBT in 1995 for $37million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from the CBT to us of $952million. The CBT was consolidated by ConocoPhillips; therefore, the cash contribution and promissory note were eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT were valued at cost and did not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders equity until after they were transferred out of the CBT. In 2010, 1,776,873shares were transferred out of the CBT.
In August 2011, all of the approximately 36million shares of company common stock held by the CBT were transferred to ConocoPhillips, and those shares are now held as non-voting treasury stock. Because the CBT was consolidated by us, the transfer of its shares from Grantor trusts to Treasury stock in the equity section of our balance sheet was recorded at the shares historical carrying value of $610 million. This transfer did not affect total equity, shares outstanding, or earnings per share. The CBT no longer holds any assets. Two smaller grantor trusts also disposed of all their shares of company stock during 2011.

We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2012 and 2031 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.
130 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2011, valuation allowances increased a total of $87million. This reflects increases of $174million primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credit and foreign loss carryforwards, partially offset by decreases of $87 million, primarily related to utilization of U.S. foreign tax credit and state loss carryforwards, currency effects and asset relinquishment. Based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $4,227million and $4,134million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed.
The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009: Millions of Dollars 2011 2010 2009 Balance at January1 $ 1,125 1,208 1,068 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 46 63 18 Additions for tax positions of prior years 145 344 177 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (35 ) (199 ) (33 ) Settlements (206 ) (215 ) (19 ) Lapse of statute (4 ) (76 ) (3 ) Balance at December31 $ 1,071 1,125 1,208 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $815 million, $914million and $931 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.
At December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $141million, $171million and $166 million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties resulted in a charge to earnings in 2011 of $10 million, a benefit to earnings in 2010 of $2 million, and a charge to earnings in 2009 of $18 million.
We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United Kingdom (2008), Canada (2005), United States (2006)and Norway (2010). Issues in dispute for audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits, but the amount of change is not estimable.

A large portion of the tax benefit of this loss was realized in 2011 because of other capital gains that occurred.
The change in the effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011was primarily due to the effect of asset dispositions occurring in 2010, partially offset by asset impairments occurring in 2010.
In the United Kingdom, legislation was enacted on July19, 2011, which increased the supplementary corporate tax rate applicable to U.K. Upstream activity from 20 to 32 percent, retroactively effective from March24, 2011. This resulted in the overall U.K. corporate rate increasing from 50 percent to 62 percent. The enactment resulted in increased income tax expense of $316 million in 2011. This is comprised of $106million due to remeasurement of U.K. deferred tax liabilities, and $210 million to reflect the new rate from March24, 2011, through the end of the year. Statutory tax rate changes did not have a significant impact on our income tax expense in 2010 or 2009.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, CFJ was no longer considered a related party due to the sale of our interest. Natural gas, crude oil, blendstock and other intermediate products were sold to WRB. In addition, we charged several of our affiliates, including CPChem and MSLP, for the use of common facilities, such as steam generators, waste and water treaters and warehouse facilities.

We purchased natural gas and natural gas liquids from DCP Midstream and CPChem for use in our refinery processes and other feedstocks from various affiliates. We purchased crude oil from LUKOIL and refined products from MRC. We also paid fees to various pipeline equity companies for transporting finished refined products and natural gas, as well as a price upgrade to MSLP for heavy crude processing. We purchased base oils and fuel products from Excel Paralubes for use in our refinery and specialty businesses.

At December31, 2011, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Qatar and Russia. The E&P segments U.S. and international operations are disclosed separately for reporting purposes.
2) Midstream This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream.
3) R&M This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. At December31, 2011, we owned or had an interest in 12refineries in the United States, one in the United Kingdom, one in Ireland, one in Germany and one in Malaysia. The R&M segments U.S. and international operations are disclosed separately for reporting purposes.
4) LUKOIL Investment This segment represents our prior investment in the ordinary shares of OAOLUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. We completed the divestiture of our entire interest in LUKOIL in the first quarter of 2011.
5) Chemicals This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50percent equity investment in CPChem.
6) Emerging Businesses This segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on powergeneration and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery, refining, alternative energy, biofuels and the environment.
Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, most interest expense and various other corporate activities. Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Note 26Planned Separation of Downstream Businesses On July14, 2011, we announced approval by our Board of Directors to pursue the separation of our refining, marketing and transportation businesses into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation via a tax-free distribution. The new downstream company, named Phillips 66, will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. In addition to the refining, marketing and transportation businesses, we expect Phillips 66 will also include most of our Midstream segment, our Chemicals segment, as well as our power generation and certain technology operations included in our Emerging Businesses segment, to create an integrated downstream company. The separation is to be accomplished by the pro rata distribution of one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held by ConocoPhillips shareholders on the record date for the share distribution.
In October 2011, we requested a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which is expected to confirm the distribution will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we filed the initial Phillips 66 Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November14, 2011, and an amendment on January3, 2012.
The separation is subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the receipt of an affirmative Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling and final Board approval, and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012.
139 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited) In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic932, Extractive ActivitiesOil and Gas, and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates oil and gas activities, covering both those in our Exploration and Production (E&P) segment, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, for periods prior to 2011, amounts reported as equity affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under the economic interest method and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would decline. At December31, 2011, approximately 10 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area.
Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United Kingdom), Russia, Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Caspian Region.
In the following disclosures, the synthetic oil classification included our past Syncrude mining operations, and the bitumen classification includes our Surmont operations and the FCCL Partnership. In June 2010, we sold our interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture; accordingly, as of December31, 2010, we no longer held synthetic oil reserves.
On July28, 2010, we announced our intention to sell our entire interest in LUKOIL over a period of time through the end of 2011. As a result of this sell down of our interest, at the end of the third quarter of 2010 we ceased using equity-method accounting for our investment in LUKOIL. Accordingly, the supplemental oil and gas disclosures reflect activity for LUKOIL through June30, 2010, which, on a lag basis, results in three quarters of activity being included in the year 2010 (the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010). Since the proved reserves tables are not on a lag basis, they reflect activity for the first three quarters of 2010, at which point LUKOILs reserves were removed from our reserve quantities.
Reserves Governance The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the SEC and FASB. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Proved reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
140 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers in our E&P business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business units reserves are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the companys Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geologists and finance personnel, reviews the business units reserves for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal audit group. The team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by ConocoPhillips.
The technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the companys reserve estimates is the Manager of Reserves Compliance and Reporting. This individual is a petroleum engineer with a bachelors degree in petroleum engineering. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience, including drilling and production engineering assignments in several field locations. He is currently serving a three-year term on the Oil& Gas Reserves Committee of the SPE and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, reserves reporting and compliance, and business management.
During 2011, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of December31, 2011, were reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm. The purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with SEC regulations. In such review, ConocoPhillips technical staff presented D&M with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves. The data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. Managements intent in retaining D&M to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls. D&Ms opinion was that the general processes and controls employed by ConocoPhillips in estimating its December31, 2011, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the SEC reserves definitions. D&Ms report is included as Exhibit 99 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December31, 2011, included:  Revisions : In 2010, revisions in Alaska, Lower 48 and Canada were primarily due to higher prices in 2010, versus 2009, as well as improved well performance. In 2009, revisions in Alaska were primarily due to higher prices in 2009, versus 2008. In 2009, for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, revisions resulted from modified coalbed methane drilling plans in Australia. In Russia, revisions were attributable to positive performance in various LUKOIL fields.
Extensions and discoveries : In 2011, for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries were primarily due to ongoing development drilling onshore Australia associated with the APLNG Project. In 2010, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 and Canada were primarily due to continued drilling success in various fields. In 2009, for our equity affiliate operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, extensions and discoveries primarily resulted from drilling success in Australia related to a coalbed methane project.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves We had 2,465million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011, compared with 2,217million BOE at year-end 2010. We converted 210million BOE of undeveloped reserves to developed during 2011 as we achieved startup of major development projects. In addition, we added 458million BOE of undeveloped reserves in 2011mainly through exploratory success and revisions. As a result, at December31, 2011, our proved undeveloped reserves represented 29 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 27 percent at December31, 2010. Costs incurred for the year ended December31, 2011, relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $4.5billion.
Approximately 70percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011 were associated with eight major development areas. Seven of the major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:  FCCL oil sandsFoster Creek and Christina Lake in Canada.
The Surmont oil sands project in Canada.
The Ekofisk Field in the North Sea.
Certain fields in the Lower 48 and Alaska.
The remaining major project, the Kashagan Field in Kazakhstan, will have proved undeveloped reserves convert to developed as this project begins production.
149 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements At the end of 2011, we did not have any material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves in individual fields or countries that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. However, our largest concentrations of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2011 are located in the Athabasca oil sands in Canada, consisting of the FCCL and Surmont steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects. The majority of our proved undeveloped reserves in this area were first recorded in 2006 and 2007, and we expect a material portion of these reserves will remain undeveloped for more than five years.
Our SAGD projects are large, multi-year projects with steady, long-term production at consistent levels. The associated reserves are expected to be developed over many years as additional well pairs are drilled across the extensive resource base to maintain throughput at the central processing facilities.
Results of Operations The companys results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown in the following tables. Additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:  Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.
Depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.
Transportation costs include costs to transport our produced hydrocarbons to their points of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process natural gas to natural gas liquids. The profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are deemed to be outside oil and gas producing activities. The net income of the transportation operations is included in other earnings.
Other related expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous expenses.
Other earnings include non-oil and gas activities within the E&P segment, such as pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, and crude oil and gas marketing activities.

Twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed. The calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available. Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered. The calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing and amount of future development, including dismantlement, and production costs.
While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

The net change in prices, and production and transportation costs is the beginning-of-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual change in the per-unit sales price, and production and transportation cost, discounted at 10 percent.
Purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the applicable reserve quantities for the year multiplied by the 12-month average sales prices, less future estimated costs, discounted at 10percent.
The accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior years discounted future cash inflows, less future production, transportation and development costs.
The net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income tax provisions.
