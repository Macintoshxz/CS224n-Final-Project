Environmental Management We monitor the environmental impact of our products. Our manufacturing subcontractors have registered our manufacturing flow to ISO 14000, the international standard related to environmental management. Lead-free solutions in electronic components and systems are receiving increasing attention within the semiconductor industry.
9 Table of Contents Our products are compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and current European REACH (Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) laws.
Product Distribution The majority of our products are distributed internationally to customers through our distribution center in Singapore and a smaller portion domestically via an operations and distribution center in Irvine, California. Net product revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations, primarily in Asia represented 98.5%, 97.2% and 94.8% of our net revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders by providing quality, state-of-the-art products, superior engineering execution, and superior sales, field application and engineering support. We market and sell our products in the United States through a direct sales force, distributors and manufacturers representatives. The majority of our domestic sales occur through our direct sales force, which is based in offices located in California and throughout the United States.
We market and sell our products internationally through regional offices in Asia, Europe and North America, as well as through a network of independent and fulfillment distributors and representatives in Asia, Australia, Europe and NorthAmerica. We or our customers select these independent entities based on their ability to provide effective field sales, marketing communications and technical support to our customers. All international sales to date have been in U.S.dollars. We present revenue from independent customers by geographic area in Note13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in PartIV, Item15 of this Report.
Backlog Our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Due to industry practice that allows customers to cancel, change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment, we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels.
Competition The semiconductor industry in general, and wired and wireless communications markets in particular, are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid change, evolving standards, short product life cycles and price erosion. We believe that the principal factors of competition for integrated circuit providers include: product quality and reputation market presence product capabilities standards compliance level of integration system cost engineering execution intellectual property reliability customer interface and support price time-to-market We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
We compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications. We also compete with suppliers of system-level and motherboard-level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than Broadcom. This competition has resulted and will continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products in certain markets. We also may face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies, and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions. We expect to encounter continuing consolidation in the markets in which we compete.
Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to 10 Table of Contents adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties, and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. In addition, competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features, lower power requirements or lower costs. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Risk Factors under Item1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with competition.
Seasonality An increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand, and tend to have stronger sales in the middle of the fiscal year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons.
Intellectual Property Our success and future product revenue growth depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. However, these may not provide meaningful or adequate protection for our intellectual property.
We currently hold more than 6,000 U.S.and more than 2,550 foreign patents (up from more than 4,800U.S.and more than 2,000 foreign patents from the prior year) and have more than 7,350 additional U.S.and foreign pending patent applications. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners, and typically control access to and distribution of product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents. As such, any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. In addition, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringing products in every jurisdiction. See Risk Factors under Item1A of this Report for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property.
Some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross-license agreements, such as the Qualcomm Agreement. See the detailed discussion in the Overview section in Item7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Moreover, because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to others, including competitors, who develop products based on those standards.
Companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. We are currently engaged in litigation and may need to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. In addition, we are currently engaged in litigation and may engage in future litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets. Such litigation will result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a detailed description of our outstanding intellectual property litigation, see Note12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in PartIV, Item15 of this Report.
Employees As of December31, 2011 we had approximately 9,590employees, including 7,260 individuals engaged in research and development, 910 engaged in sales and marketing, 580 engaged in manufacturing operations, and 840 11 Table of Contents engaged in general and administrative activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
Item1A.
Risk Factors Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Broadcom, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our ClassA common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
Our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter. Variability in the nature of our operating results may be attributed to the factors identified throughout this Risk Factors section, many of which may be outside our control, including:  changes in economic conditions in the markets we address, including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry;  seasonality in sales of consumer and enterprise products in which our products are incorporated;  our dependence on a few significant customers and/or design wins for a substantial portion of our revenue;  timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, to manage inventory;  changes in customer product needs and market acceptance of our products;  competitive pressures and other factors such as the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products;  the impact of a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, severe weather, tsunami or other flooding, or a nuclear crisis, as well as interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities such as water and electricity, on a key location such as our corporate headquarters or our Northern California facilities, both of which are located near major earthquake fault lines; and  the impact of tax examinations.
We depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers. Sales to our five largest customers represented 42.6%, 38.6% and 34.6% of our total net revenue for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
A significant portion of our revenue in any period may also depend on a single product design win with a large customer. As a result, the loss of any such key design win or any significant delay in the ramp of volume production of the customers products into which our product is designed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to maintain sales to certain of our key customers or continue to secure key design wins for a variety of reasons, including:  agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products; and  our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty.
In addition, the majority of our licensing revenues and related income to date has been derived from agreements with two customers, Verizon Wireless and Qualcomm. From January 2008 through December 2011, we recorded $753 million in licensing revenue and related income derived from Verizon Wireless and Qualcomm and we expect 12 Table of Contents to record an additional $272 million. The licensing revenue from our agreement with Verizon Wireless has ended and the income from the Qualcomm Agreement is non-recurring and will terminate in 2013. There can be no assurances that we will be able to enter into additional such arrangements in the future, or that we will be able to successfully collect the remaining payments due to us under the Qualcomm Agreement in the event of a default by Qualcomm.
The loss of a key customer or design win, a reduction in sales to any key customer, decrease in licensing revenue, significant delay in our customers product development plans, or our inability to attract new significant customers or secure new key design wins could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
We face intense competition.
The semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets are intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase as new markets develop, as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our business. We expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete.
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and presences in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do, and in some cases operate their own fabrication facilities. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. We also face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products, and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions.
Existing or new competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition also has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expenditures on research and development, declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets. These factors in turn create increased pressure to consolidate. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors. If we do not compete successfully, we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline.
We face risks associated with our acquisition strategy.
A key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies. The expansion of our business through acquisitions allows us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify or consummate future acquisitions or realize the desired benefit from these acquisitions.
We face a number of challenges associated with our acquisition strategy that could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management team, including:  delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired companys technologies;  the loss of key personnel;  if our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are less favorable than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges;  lower gross margins, revenues and operating income than originally anticipated at the time of acquisition and other financial challenges; and  becoming subject to intellectual property or other litigation.
Acquisitions can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities. While we believe we will have the ability to service any additional debt we may potentially issue in connection with acquisitions, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic 13 Table of Contents conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. Acquisitions can also result in adverse tax consequences, warranty or product liability exposure related to acquired assets, additional stock-based compensation expense, write up of acquired inventory to fair value, and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets. In addition, we may record goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with an acquisition and incur impairment charges in the future. Each of the above may apply equally to our pending acquisition of NetLogic Microsystems, Inc., which is our largest acquisition to date.
We may fail to adjust our operations in response to changes in demand.
Through internal growth and acquisitions, we significantly modified the scope of our operations and workforce in recent years. Our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, such as research and development expenses and our highly skilled workforce. During some periods, our growth has placed a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. To respond to periods of increased demand, we will be required to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce. Alternatively, in response to the economic downturn in the markets in the semiconductor industry and communications market, we may be required to implement restructuring actions and a number of other cost saving measures. All of these endeavors require substantial management effort. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations, we may be unable to adjust our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities, or conversely, we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue, either of which would materially and adversely affect our current or future business.
Our operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address.
We operate primarily in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards. From time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns characterized by decreases in product demand, excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices. The semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may affect our ability to ship products. An increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand. Economic volatility can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and vendors in accurately forecasting and planning future business activities. This unpredictability could cause our customers to reduce spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers and vendors may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. As a result, we may experience growth patterns that are different than the end demand for products, particularly during periods of high volatility.
We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery or the impact of such events on our customers, our vendors or us. The combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions and supply chain cross-dependencies could have a compound impact on our business. The impact of market volatility is not limited to revenue but may also affect our product gross margins and other financial metrics. Any downturn in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of the industry or wired and wireless communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our stock price is highly volatile.
The market price of our ClassA common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. From January1, 2009 through December31, 2011 our ClassA common stock has traded at prices as low as $15.31 and as high as $47.39 per share. Fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control.
In addition, the market prices of securities of Internet-related, semiconductor and other technology companies have been and remain volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many 14 Table of Contents technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, the market price of our ClassA common stock will likely decline. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid. In the past, we, and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities, have been the subject of securities class action litigation.
Due to the nature of our compensation programs, most of our executive officers sell shares of our common stock each quarter or otherwise periodically, often pursuant to trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, sales of shares by our executive officers may not be indicative of their respective opinions of Broadcoms performance at the time of sale or of our potential future performance. Nonetheless, the market price of our stock may be affected by sales of shares by our executive officers.
We may be required to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of others and/or may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights.
Companies in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights. Additionally, we receive notices that challenge the validity of our patents. Intellectual property litigation can be expensive, time consuming and distracting to management. An adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or could prevent us from enforcing our intellectual property rights.
We may also be required to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another partys proprietary rights. We have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them. These indemnification provisions may, in some circumstances, extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential damages and/or lost profits. Even if claims or litigation against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend.
Our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors, suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. Any of these claims or litigation may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, our success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes. Any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We engage in litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, including our customers. If our intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours.
Our software may be derived from open source software, which is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Open source software is often made available under licenses, which impose certain obligations in the event we distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public, and/or license such derivative works on different terms than those customarily used to protect our intellectual property. With respect to our proprietary software, we generally license such software under terms that prohibit combining it with open source software. Despite these restrictions, parties may combine our proprietary software with open source software without our authorization, in which case we might nonetheless be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.
15 Table of Contents We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology without our authorization. Additionally, current, departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology or interrupt our business. Because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate, counter or ameliorate these techniques. As a result, our technologies and processes may be misappropriated.
We cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed. Identifying unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming. The initiation of litigation may adversely affect our relationships and agreements with certain customers that have a stake in the outcome of the litigation proceedings. Litigation is very expensive and may divert the attention of management and other key employees from the operation of the business, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties.
It is difficult to accurately predict demand for our semiconductor products. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Customers can generally cancel, change or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand is further impaired by delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle. We operate in a dynamic industry and use significant resources to develop new products for existing and new markets. After we have developed a product, there is no guarantee that our customers will integrate our product into their equipment or devices and, ultimately, bring those equipment and devices incorporating our product to market. In these situations, we may never produce or deliver a significant number of our products, even after incurring substantial development expenses. From the time a customer elects to integrate our solution into their product, it is typically six to 24 months before high volume production of that product commences. After volume production begins, we cannot be assured that the equipment or devices incorporating our product will gain market acceptance.
Our products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, creating supply chain cross-dependencies. Accordingly, supply chain disruptions affecting components of our customers devices and/or systems could negatively impact the demand for our products, even if the supply of our products is not directly affected.
Our product demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. In the event we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell. As a result, we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we could forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Also, due to our industrys shift to just-in-time inventory management, any disruption in the supply chain could lead to more immediate shortages in product or component supply. In addition, an increasing percentage of our inventory is maintained under hubbing arrangements whereby products are delivered to a customer or third party warehouse based upon the customers projected needs. Under these arrangements, we do not recognize product revenue until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products. Our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired under our hubbing arrangements, which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product inventory and negatively impact our cash flow.
We manufacture and sell complex products and may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products.
We expect that a high percentage of our future sales will come from sales of new products. We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles. The markets for some of these products are new to us and may be immature and/or unpredictable. These markets may not develop into profitable opportunities and we have invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate our future revenue streams from, or the sustainability of, our new products.
16 Table of Contents Our industry is dynamic and we are required to devote significant resources to research and development to remain competitive. The development of new silicon devices is highly complex, and due to supply chain cross-dependencies and other issues, we may experience delays in completing the development, production and introduction of our new products. We may choose to discontinue one or more products or product development programs to dedicate more resources to other products. The discontinuation of an existing or planned product may adversely affect our relationship with one or more of our customers.
Our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors, including our ability to:  effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets;  timely complete and introduce new integrated products;  transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries;  license any desired third party technology or intellectual property rights;  obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials; and  qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products.
If we are not able to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective and timely manner, we will be unable to attract new customers or to retain our existing customers which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
We have experienced hardware and software defects and bugs associated with the introduction of our highly complex products. If any of our products contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products. These problems could interrupt or delay sales and shipments of our products to customers. To alleviate these problems, we may have to divert our resources from other development efforts. In addition, these problems could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including possible claims for consequential damages and/or lost profits.
We are exposed to risks associated with our international operations.
We currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing, assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the United States. Products shipped to international destinations, primarily in Asia, represented 98.5%, 97.2% and 94.8% of our product revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, we undertake various sales and marketing activities through regional offices in a number of countries. We intend to continue expanding our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad.
International operations are subject to many inherent risks, including but not limited to:  political, social and economic instability;  exposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property;  continuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security;  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows;  changes in taxation and tariffs; and  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.
Economic conditions in our primary overseas markets, particularly in Asia, may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad. Also, all of our international sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies. We anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities.
We depend on third parties to fabricate, assemble and test our products.
As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not own or operate fabrication, assembly or test facilities. We rely on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test substantially all of our semiconductor devices. Accordingly, we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance. This lack of control could result in 17 Table of Contents product shortages or quality assurance problems. These issues could delay shipments of our products or increase our assembly or testing costs. In addition, the consolidation of foundry subcontractors, as well as the increasing capital intensity and complexity associated with fabrication in smaller process geometries may limit our diversity of suppliers, potentially driving increased wafer prices and adversely affecting our results of operations, including our product gross margins.
We do not have long-term agreements with any of our direct or indirect suppliers, including our manufacturing, assembly or test subcontractors. We typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. In the event our third-party foundry subcontractors experience a disruption or limitation of manufacturing, assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative manufacturing, assembly and testing services in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, our foundries must have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process, which could be time-consuming. We could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative manufactures, assemblers or testers for our products. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products.
Because we rely on outside foundries and other third party suppliers, we face several significant risks in addition to those discussed above, including:  a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;  the limited availability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and  the location of foundries and other suppliers in regions that are subject to earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters.
The manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process. Our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. This often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start-up of new process technologies. In addition, we are dependent on our foundry subcontractors to successfully transition to smaller geometry processes.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.
In January 2010, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which Broadcom would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock. In January 2011, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend payment. We intend to continue to pay such dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of Broadcom applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends.
Future dividends may be affected by, among other factors:  our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development;  use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions;  stock repurchase programs;  changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and  changes to our business model.
Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend payment or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.
We may be unable to attract, retain or motivate key personnel.
Our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis, we will experience difficulty in implementing our current business and product plans. In that event, we may be unable to successfully meet competitive challenges or to exploit potential market opportunities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
18 Table of Contents Government regulation may adversely affect our business.
The effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may materially and adversely impact our business. For example, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has broad jurisdiction in the United States over many of the devices into which our products are incorporated. FCC regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable or satellite operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products in the United States. In addition, we may experience delays if a product incorporating our chips fails to comply with FCC emissions specifications.
We and our customers are subject to various import and export laws and regulations. Government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products. If we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations, we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at foreign foundries or ship these products to certain customers, or we may incur penalties or fines.
Our business may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the United States. Foreign governments may impose tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non-domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally. These tariffs, duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revisedenvironmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. For instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new disclosure requirements relating to the sourcing of certain minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain other adjoining countries. When these new requirements are in effect, theycould adversely affectour costs, the availability of minerals used in our productsand our relationships with customers and suppliers.
Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities.
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we file. Changes in current or future laws or regulations, or the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new related interpretations by taxing authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to examinations and tax audits. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these audits will not have an adverse effect on our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards, our financial position, or our operating results.
In certain foreign jurisdictions, we operate under tax holidays and favorable tax incentives. For instance, in Singapore we operate under tax holidays, which are effective through March31, 2014, that reduce taxes on substantially all of our operating income in that jurisdiction. Such tax holidays and incentives often require us to meet specified employment and investment criteria in such jurisdictions. In a period of tight manufacturing capacity, our ability to meet Singaporean content in our products may be more limited, which may have adverse tax consequences. More generally, if any of our tax holidays or incentives are terminated or if we fail to meet the criteria to continue to enjoy such holidays or incentives, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We have begun discussions with the Singapore Economic Development Board with respect to tax incentives for periods after March31, 2014. No assurances can be given that such discussions will be successful. If we are unable to reach an agreement with Singapore (or another jurisdiction that provides similar benefits to those we realize from our current incentives in Singapore), our results of operations and financial position for periods after March31, 2014 will be adversely affected.
Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions.
Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. For example, our Board of Directors may also issue shares of Class B common stock in connection with certain acquisitions, which have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote (as compared to one vote per share in the case of our ClassA common stock) as well as the right to vote separately as a class. In addition, our Board of 19 Table of Contents Directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue shares of common or preferred stock without a shareholder vote. These provisions, among others, may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control.
Our co-founders and their affiliates may control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders.
As of December31, 2011 our co-founders, directors, executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned 10.8% of our outstanding common stock and held 51.9% of the total voting power held by our shareholders. Accordingly, these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders. These matters include the election of our Board of Directors, the issuance of additional shares of Class B common stock, and the approval of most significant corporate transactions, including certain mergers and consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In particular, as of December31, 2011 our two founders, Dr.HenryT. Nicholas III and Dr.Henry Samueli, beneficially owned a total of 9.7% of our outstanding common stock and held 51.5% of the total voting power held by our shareholders. Because of their significant voting stock ownership, we will not be able to engage in certain transactions, and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions, without the approval of one or both of these shareholders. Repurchases of shares of our ClassA common stock under our share repurchase program would result in an increase in the total voting power of our co-founders, directors, executive officers and their affiliates, as well as other continuing shareholders.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information and Holders Our ClassA common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol BRCM. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices for our ClassA common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market: 2011 2010 High Low High Low Fourth Quarter $ 38.37 $ 27.59 $ 47.00 $ 34.34 Third Quarter 38.88 30.98 38.47 29.90 Second Quarter 41.00 30.71 36.94 29.05 First Quarter 47.39 38.60 34.30 26.40 As of December31, 2011 and 2010 there were 1,005 and 1,070 record holders of our ClassA common stock and 147 and 154 record holders of our ClassB common stock, respectively. On January31, 2012, the last reported sale price of our ClassA common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $34.35 per share.
Our ClassB common stock is not publicly traded. Each share of ClassB common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of ClassA common stock and in most instances automatically converts upon sale or other transfer.
21 Table of Contents Stock Performance Graph The following graphs compare the cumulative five-year and seven-year total return attained by shareholders on Broadcom Corporations common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 index, the PHLXSemiconductor index, and the NASDAQ Composite index. An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each index on December31, 2006 (for the five-year graph) and December31, 2004 (for the seven-year graph) and its relative performance is tracked through December31, 2011. Shareholder returns over the indicated periods should not be considered indicative of future stock prices or shareholder returns.
COMPARISON OF 5 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN AMONG BROADCOM CORPORATION, THE S&P 500 INDEX, THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX AND THE PHLX SEMICONDUCTOR INDEX 22 Table of Contents COMPARISON OF 7 YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN AMONG BROADCOM CORPORATION, THE S&P 500 INDEX, THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX AND THE PHLX SEMICONDUCTOR INDEX Dividend Policy In January 2010 our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08per common share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of 2010. In January 2011 our Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the existing dividend policy pursuant to which we increased the quarterly cash dividend by 12.5% to $0.09 per common share ($0.36 per share on an annual basis) and declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.09 per share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of 2011. In 2011 and 2010 we paid $194 million and $163million, respectively, in dividends to holders of our ClassA and ClassB common stock. These dividends were paid from U.S.domestic sources other than our retained earnings and are accounted for as reductions of shareholders equity.
The cash dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends under that policy are subject to the Boards continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of Broadcom applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities In 2011 we issued an aggregate of 1million shares of ClassA common stock upon conversion of a like number of shares of ClassB common stock in connection with their disposition. Each share of ClassB common stock is convertible at any time into one share of ClassA common stock at the option of the holder. The offers and sales of those securities were effected without registration in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities From time to time our Board of Directors has authorized various programs to repurchase shares of our ClassA common stock depending on market conditions and other factors. In February 2010 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized an evergreen share repurchase program intended to offset dilution of incremental grants 23 Table of Contents of stock awards associated with our stock incentive plans. The maximum number of shares of our ClassA common stock that may be repurchased in any one year (including under an ASR or other arrangement) is equal to the total number of shares issued pursuant to our equity awards in the previous year and the current year. Our February 2010 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended at any time at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
In February 2011 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement to repurchase $300 million of our ClassA common stock, which was recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity. Under the ASR program we received and cancelled 7million shares of our ClassA common stock with a weighted average price of $42.64 per share.
In addition to the shares repurchased under the ASR, we repurchased 10million shares of our ClassA common stock at a weighted average price of $36.84 per share in 2011. We repurchased 9million and 15million shares of our ClassA common stock at weighted average prices of $30.86 and $28.12 per share in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Repurchases under our share repurchase programs were and are intended to be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included in PartIV, Item15 of this Report and the Risk Factors included in PartI, Item1A of this Report, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Report, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock.
Overview Broadcom Corporation (including our subsidiaries, referred to collectively in this Report as Broadcom, we, our and us) is a global innovation leader in semiconductor solutions for wired and wireless communications. Broadcom products seamlessly deliver voice, video, data and multimedia connectivity in the home, the office and the mobile environment. We provide the industrys broadest portfolio of state-of-the-art system-on-a-chip, or SoC, and software solutions.
We sell our products to leading wired and wireless communications manufacturers in each of our reportable segments: Broadband Communications (Home), Mobile& Wireless (Hand) and Infrastructure& Networking (Infrastructure). Because we leverage our technologies across different markets, certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into products used in multiple markets. We utilize independent foundries and third-party subcontractors to manufacture, assemble and test all of our semiconductor products.
Our diverse product portfolio includes:  Broadband Communications (Solutions for the Home) Complete solutions for cable, xDSL, fiber, satellite and IP broadband networks to enable the connected home, including set-top-boxes and media servers, residential modems and gateways, femtocells and wired home networking solutions.
Mobile& Wireless (Solutions for the Hand) Low-power, high-performance and highly integrated solutions powering the mobile and wireless ecosystem, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, cellular modems, personal navigation and global positioning, near field communications (NFC), Voice over IP (VoIP), multimedia and application processing, and mobile power management solutions.
Infrastructure& Networking (Solutions for Infrastructure) Highly integrated solutions for carriers, service providers, enterprises, small-to-medium businesses and data centers for network infrastructure needs, including switches, physical layer (PHY) and microwave devices for local, metropolitan, wide area and storage networking; switch fabric solutions, high-speed ethernet controllers, security and embedded processors.
Our product revenue consists principally of sales of semiconductor devices and, to a lesser extent, software licenses and royalties, development, support and maintenance agreements, data services and cancellation fees. The majority of our product sales occur through the efforts of our direct sales force. The remaining balance of our product sales occurs through distributors. Our licensing revenue and income is generated from the licensing of our intellectual property, of which the vast majority to date has been derived from agreements with two customers, Verizon Wireless and Qualcomm. The licensing revenue from our agreement with Verizon Wireless ended in March 2009 and the income from the Qualcomm Agreement is non-recurring and will terminate in 2013. There can be no assurances that we will be able to enter into similar arrangements in the future. At December31, 2011 we had deferred income of $13 million related to the Qualcomm Agreement.
The following table details the amount of licensing revenue from our agreement with Verizon Wireless and income from the Qualcomm Agreement that was recognized or is scheduled to be recognized from 2008 to 2013: Recognized Scheduled to be Recognized 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In millions) Income from Qualcomm Agreement $  $ 171 $ 207 $ 207 $ 186 $ 86 $  $ 857 Licensing revenue from Verizon Wireless 149 19      168 $ 149 $ 190 $ 207 $ 207 $ 186 $ 86 $  $ 1,025 Product Cycles.
The cycle for test, evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than nine months, with an additional three to more than twelve months before a customer commences 27 Table of Contents volume production of equipment or devices incorporating our products. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development, selling, general and administrative efforts, and investments in inventory, to the time we generate corresponding revenue, if any. The rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter. If anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, and our results of operations for that quarter, and potentially for future quarters, would be materially and adversely affected.
Acquisition Strategy.
An element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and enhance our technological capabilities. Since our initial public offering, we have acquired over 50 companies. From 2009 through 2011, we made acquisitions totaling $1.11 billion in purchase consideration, of which $155 million, $387 million and $569 million related to our Broadband Communications, Mobile& Wireless and Infrastructure& Networking reportable segments, respectively. We plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise, including acquisitions and other business combination transactions, strategic relationships, capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets.
In September 2011 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire NetLogic Microsystems, Inc., or NetLogic, a publicly traded company that is a leader in high performance intelligent semiconductor solutions for next generation networks. The expected purchase consideration is approximately $3.7 billion, net of cash assumed, based on the shares outstanding on September11, 2011. The transaction has been approved by the Broadcom and NetLogic boards of directors and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of clearance by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce under Chinese Antimonopoly Law. There are no financing contingencies related to the acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of operations of our acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates. See Note3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these acquisitions.
Operating Results for the Year Ended December31, 2011 In 2011 our net income was $927 million as compared to net income of $1.08 billion in 2010. The decrease in profitability was primarily related to lower gross margins and an increase in research and development expenses, as well as the impairment of certain of our purchased intangible assets, our charitable contribution and our restructuring charge.
Other highlights during 2011 include the following:  Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $5.20 billion at December31, 2011, compared with $4.06 billion at December31, 2010. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.84 billion during 2011 as compared to $1.37 billion in 2010.
In January 2011 our Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the existing dividend policy pursuant to which we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 12.5% to $0.09 per share ($0.36 per share on an annual basis) and declared a dividend of $0.09 per share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of 2011.
In February 2011 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement to repurchase $300 million dollars of our ClassA common stock, which was recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity. Under the ASR program we received and cancelled 7million shares of our ClassA common stock with a weighted average price of $42.64 per share. In addition to the shares repurchased under the ASR in February 2011, we repurchased 10million shares at a weighted average price of $36.84 per share.
In April 2011 we completed our acquisition of Provigent Inc., a privately-held company that provides highly integrated, high performance, mixed signal semiconductors for microwave backhaul systems. In connection with the acquisition, we paid $314 million, exclusive of cash assumed, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity rights of Provigent.
In May 2011 we completed our acquisition of SC Square Ltd., a leading security software developer for $40 million, exclusive of cash acquired.
28 Table of Contents  In May 2011 the court entered an order granting final approval of a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, or Derivative Settlement related to our federal consolidated shareholder derivative action. In connection with the Derivative Settlement, we recorded a $43 million settlement gain in our consolidated statements of income and paid plaintiffs counsel $25 million of the settlement proceeds for attorneys fees, expenses, and costs, which was recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of income. In September and December 2011 we also recorded total net settlement costs of $32 million related to patent infringement claims.
In June 2011 we contributed $25 million to the Broadcom Foundation to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs, as well as a broad range of community services which was recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of income.
In June 2011 we recorded a purchased intangible impairment charge of $74 million related to our acquisition of Beceem Communications, Inc. in 2010. The primary factor contributing to this impairment charge was a reduction in the forecasted cash flows related to WiMAX products, as wireless service providers have accelerated their adoption of Long Term Evolution, or LTE, products. We also recorded other impairment charges of $18 million in 2011.
In June 2011 we completed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of our income tax returns for 2004 to 2006, executed a closing agreement covering the 2001 to 2006 tax years, and agreed to certain adjustments for the 2001 to 2006 tax years, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing transactions. Such adjustments were offset by net operating losses and credits, and did not result in any income tax expense or cash tax liability. As a result, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were reduced by $620 million and $430 million, respectively, which were offset with corresponding reductions in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
As part of our regular product portfolio management review process and in light of our decision to significantly reduce our investment in our digital television and Blu-ray Disc product lines within our Broadband Communications operating segment, in September 2011 we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide headcount by approximately 300 employees. We recorded an aggregate of $16 million in net restructuring costs in 2011.
In November 2011 we completed a debt offering of $500million aggregate principal amount of 2.700%Senior Notes due 2018. We also amended our credit facility in October 2011 to primarily extend the maturity date by two years to November19, 2016. To date, we have not drawn on this credit facility.

Factors That May Impact Net Income Our net income has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following:  our product mix and volume of product sales and corresponding gross margin (see further discussion below under Factors That May Impact Net Revenue and Factors That May Impact Product Gross Margin );  required levels of research and development and other operating costs;  stock-based compensation expense;  licensing and income from intellectual property;  impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets;  deferral of revenue and costs under multiple-element arrangements;  amortization of purchased intangible assets;  cash-based incentive compensation expense;  litigation costs and insurance recoveries;  settlement costs or gains;  changes in tax laws, adjustments to tax reserves and the results of income tax audits;  the loss of interest income resulting from lower average interest rates and investment balance reductions resulting from expenditures on repurchases of our ClassA common stock, dividends and acquisitions of businesses;  charitable contributions;  other-than-temporary impairment of marketable securities; and  restructuring costs.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, rebates, allowances for doubtful 30 Table of Contents accounts, sales returns and allowances, warranty obligations, inventory valuation, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations, strategic investments, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, self-insurance, restructuring costs, litigation and other loss contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.
We believe the following are critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions or judgments:  Net Revenue.
We recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (i)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii)delivery has occurred, (iii)our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv)collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured. These criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment. However, we do not recognize revenue when any future performance obligations remain. Customer purchase orders and/or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents are used to verify product delivery. We assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history.
In arrangements that include a combination of semiconductor products and other elements, judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. We allocate the arrangement consideration based on each elements relative fair value using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, third-party evidence, or estimated selling prices, as the basis of fair value. Revenue is recognized for the accounting units when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met.
A portion of our sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and/or rights of return. These pricing credits and/or rights of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the inventory to be sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements. As a result, the price to the customer is not fixed or determinable at the time we deliver products to our distributors. Accordingly, product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers. In addition, distributors provide us with periodic data regarding product, price, quantity, and customers when products are shipped to their customers, as well as the quantities of our products that they still have in stock. For specialized shipping terms we may rely on data provided by our freight forwarding providers. For our licensing revenue we rely on data provided by the licensee. Any error in the data provided to us by customers, distributors or other third parties could lead to inaccurate reporting of our total net revenue and net income.
We defer revenue and income when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Deferred revenue does not include amounts from products delivered to distributors that the distributors have not yet sold through to their end customers.
Income from the Qualcomm Agreement.
On April26, 2009 we entered into a four-year Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement, or the Qualcomm Agreement, with QUALCOMM Incorporated, or Qualcomm. The Qualcomm Agreement is a multiple element arrangement. We allocated the amount to be received under the Qualcomm Agreement amongst several elements. A gain from the settlement of litigation was immediately recognized and approximated the value of awards determined by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The remaining consideration was predominantly associated with the transfer of current and future intellectual property rights, as well as the settlement of all other outstanding litigation, and is being recognized over the four year performance period as a single unit of accounting.
31 Table of Contents The value associated with the transfer of intellectual property rights and other elements was treated as a single unit of accounting and, based on the predominant nature of these elements, recognized them within net revenue over the contractual performance period of four years, beginning in 2009 and extending through 2013. The elements included: (i)an exchange of intellectual property rights, including in certain circumstances, a series of covenants not to assert claims of patent infringement under future patents issued within one to four years of the execution date of the agreement, (ii)the assignment of certain existing patents by Broadcom to Qualcomm with Broadcom retaining a royalty-free license under these patents, and (iii)the settlement of all outstanding litigation and claims between us and Qualcomm.
We consider the Qualcomm Agreement as predominantly related to the transfer of current and future intellectual property rights. This conclusion was based on (a)the amounts specifically awarded by the courts for the patents that were the subject of litigation for which appeals had been substantially exhausted and (b)the extensive nature of the rights transferred to Qualcomm, both for our existing patent portfolio and for the patents we would develop during the next one to four years. In addition, we obtained a third party valuation of the intellectual property rights. The inputs and assumptions we used in this valuation were from a market participant perspective and included projected revenue, royalty rates, estimated discount rates, useful lives and income tax rates, among others. The development of a number of these inputs and assumptions in our model requires a significant amount of management judgment and is based upon a number of factors including the selection of industry comparables, market growth rates and other relevant factors. Changes in any number of these assumptions would have substantially changed the fair value assigned to the intellectual property rights. These inputs and assumptions represent managements best estimates at the time of the transaction.
Sales Returns, Pricing Adjustments and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
We record reductions of revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as competitive pricing programs and rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods. Additional reductions of revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of any customer were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.
Inventory Write-Downs and Warranty Reserves.
We write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs could be required. Under the hubbing arrangements that we maintain with certain customers, we own inventory that is physically located in a customers or third partys warehouse. As a result, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired, which would cause our total inventory turns to decrease. In that event, our expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory could increase and our cash flow could be negatively impacted. Our products typically carry a one to three year warranty. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates, product recalls, repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure, as well as possible claims for consequential costs. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required. In that event, our product gross margins would be reduced.
32 Table of Contents  Stock-Based Compensation Expense.
All share-based payments, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights, are recognized in our financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values. The fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and stock purchase rights. Although we utilize the Black-Scholes model, which meets established requirements, the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees, such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. Our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of fair value than historical volatility. The expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights. Prior to 2010, our dividend yield assumption excluded dividend payouts. In 2010 we began to pay quarterly dividends and included that assumption in our fair value calculations. The fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our ClassA common stock on the date of grant less our expected dividend yield. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our stock-based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets.
The value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i)any future declines in our operating results, (ii)a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii)a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry, (iv)any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results or (v)the abandonment of any of our acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, projects.
Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In 2011 we early adopted the new provisions issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, that intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing. The updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. We determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach, as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount, by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.
During development, IPR&D is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, 33 Table of Contents an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Once an IPR&D project is complete, it becomes a definite lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for long-lived assets.
We test long lived assets and purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill and IPR&D in development) for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist. We determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable, based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset are expected to generate. If an asset is not recoverable, we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and purchased intangible assets.
Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. It is possible, however, that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.
Deferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions.
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. As a result of our cumulative losses in the U.S.and certain foreign jurisdictions, our U.S.tax losses after tax deductions for stock-based compensation, and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities, we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in the U.S.and certain foreign jurisdictions. In certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses, we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In the future, if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance, we may record a reduction of income tax expense in the period of such realization. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. If we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies. Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S.or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities.
Litigation and Settlement Costs.
We are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal proceedings. We prosecute and defend these matters aggressively. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and/or substantial settlement costs. In addition, the resolution of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past alleged infringement or to obtain a license under the other partys intellectual property rights that could require one-time license fees or running royalties, which could adversely impact product gross margins in future periods, or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may 34 Table of Contents perform for Broadcom. We account for settlement agreements as multiple element arrangements and allocate the consideration to the identifiable elements based on relative fair value. Generally the identifiable elements are the licensing of intellectual property for future use and payments related to alleged prior infringement. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We continually evaluate the uncertainties associated with litigation and record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and/or our ability to settle disputes on terms acceptable to us are subject to significant uncertainty. Should we choose to pay significant sums in settling a dispute or should material legal matters be resolved against the Company, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

The following table presents net revenue from each of our reportable segments and its respective contribution to net revenue: Year Ended December31, 2011 2010 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue Increase (Decrease) % Change (In millions, except percentages) Broadband Communications $ 2,039 27.6 % $ 2,134 31.3 % $ (95 ) (4.5 )% Mobile & Wireless 3,484 47.2 2,889 42.4 595 20.6 Infrastructure & Networking 1,658 22.4 1,588 23.3 70 4.4 All other (1) 208 2.8 207 3.0 1 0.5 Total net revenue $ 7,389 100.0 % $ 6,818 100.0 % $ 571 8.4 (1) Includes (i)income relating to the Qualcomm Agreement that was entered into in April 2009 and (ii)other revenue from certain patent agreements. See discussion above in the Overview section and Notes1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The decrease in net revenue from our Broadband Communications reportable segment resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for our digital television and Blu-ray Disc product lines and set top boxes, offset in part by an increase in demand for our broadband modems. As a result, we decided to reduce our investment in our digital television and Blu-ray Disc product lines and reallocate funding to higher return opportunities. The increase in net revenue from our Mobile& Wireless reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our wireless connectivity and cellular solutions. The increase in net revenue from our Infrastructure& Networking reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our Ethernet switching and wireless infrastructure products, offset in part by a reduction in demand for our Ethernet controller products.

See discussion above in the Overview section and Notes1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The decrease in net revenue from our Broadband Communications reportable segment resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for our digital television and Blu-ray Disc product lines. The decrease in net revenue from our Mobile& Wireless reportable segment resulted from a decrease in demand for our wireless connectivity solutions. The decrease in net revenue from our Infrastructure& Networking reportable segment resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for most product lines.
We recorded rebates to certain customers of $643million, or 8.7% of net revenue and $526million, or 7.7% of net revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in rebates in 2011 was attributable to a change in the mix of sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs, primarily an increase in the Mobile& Wireless area. We 37 Table of Contents anticipate that accrued rebates will vary in future periods based upon the level of overall sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. We reversed accrued rebates of $13million and $4million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
From time to time, our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. We expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the seasonal variations in consumer products and changes in the overall economic environment. Additionally, since we own inventory that is physically located in a third partys warehouse, our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired, causing our total inventory turns to decrease, which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete products and negatively impact our cash flow.
For these and other reasons, our total net revenue and results of operations for the year ended December31, 2011 and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations.
Concentration of Net Revenue The following table presents details of our product net revenue: Year Ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 Product sales through direct sales force 76.8 % 77.6 % 78.8 % Product sales maintained under fulfillment distributor arrangements 7.5 7.9 8.1 Product sales through distributors 15.7 14.5 13.1 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Sales to our significant customers, including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors, as a percentage of net revenue were as follows: YearEnded December31, 2011 2010 2009 Apple 13.1 % 10.9 % * Samsung 10.0 10.0 10.3 % Five largest customers as a group 42.6 38.6 34.6 * Less than 10% of net revenue.
We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future. The identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our total net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period.
Product revenue derived from shipments to international destinations, as a percentage of product revenue was as follows: YearEnded December31, 2011 2010 2009 China (exclusive of Hong Kong) 33.4 % 30.4 % 28.3 % Hong Kong 26.4 26.0 24.8 Singapore, Taiwan and Japan 22.9 25.3 26.3 Europe 1.8 2.4 2.7 Other 14.0 13.1 12.7 98.5 % 97.2 % 94.8 % All of our revenue to date has been denominated in U.S.dollars.
38 Table of Contents Factors That May Impact Net Revenue The demand for our products and the subsequent recognition of net revenue has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following:  general economic and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry, trends in the wired and wireless communications markets in various geographic regions, including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated;  the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and distributors, to manage inventory;  the timing of our distributors shipments to their customers or when products are taken by our customers under hubbing arrangements;  our ability to specify, develop or acquire, complete, introduce, market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner;  the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt/ramp our products and technologies;  the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products; and  the availability of credit and financing, which may lead certain of our customers to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us.
Cost of Product Revenue and Product Gross Margin.
Cost of product revenue comprises the cost of our semiconductor devices, which consists of the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries, costs associated with our purchase of assembly, test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products, as well as royalties paid to vendors for use of their technology. Also included in cost of product revenue is the amortization of purchased technology and inventory valuation step-up, and manufacturing overhead, including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support, product warranty costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support. Product gross margin is product revenue less cost of product revenue divided by product revenue and does not include income from the Qualcomm Agreement and revenue from the licensing of intellectual property. Total gross margin is total net revenue less cost of product revenue divided by total net revenue.
Product gross margin decreased to 49.4% in 2011 as compared to 50.2% in 2010 primarily as a result of (i)an increase in amortization of purchased intangibles and inventory valuation step-up of $37 million primarily due to our acquisitions completed over the last twelve months, and (ii)a shift in the mix of our product revenues with more revenues attributable to Mobile& Wireless products.
Product gross margin decreased to 49.3% in the three months ended December31, 2011 from 49.5% in the three months ended September30, 2011 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of our product revenues, offset in part by a decrease in amortization of inventory valuation step-up of $4 million.
Factors That May Impact Product and Total Gross Margin Our product gross margin has been affected in the past, and may continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the following:  our product mix and volume of product sales (including sales to high volume customers);  the positions of our products in their respective life cycles;  introduction of products with lower margins;  the effects of competition;  the effects of competitive pricing programs and rebates;  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and their relationship to demand volatility;  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies;  fluctuations in direct product costs such as silicon wafer costs and assembly, packaging and testing costs, and other fixed costs;  our ability to create cost advantages through successful integration and convergence; 39 Table of Contents  our ability to advance to the next technology node faster than our competitors;  the consolidation of foundry subcontractors that could potentially drive increased wafer prices;  licensing royalties payable by us;  product warranty costs;  fair value and related amortization of acquired tangible and intangible assets; and  amortization of acquired inventory valuation step-up.
Our product and total gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock-based compensation expense and changes therein, as discussed below, and the amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research, design and development activities, including stock-based compensation expense. Development and design costs consist primarily of costs related to engineering design tools, mask and prototyping costs, testing and subcontracting costs. In addition, we incur costs related to facilities and equipment expense, among other items.
The following table presents details of research and development expense: Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2011 2010 Amount %of Net Revenue Amount %of Net Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Salaries and benefits $ 1,097 14.8 % $ 929 13.6 % $ 168 18.1 % Stock-based compensation 364 4.9 341 5.0 23 6.7 Development and design costs 278 3.8 274 4.0 4 1.5 Other 244 3.3 218 3.1 26 11.9 Research and development $ 1,983 26.8 % $ 1,762 25.7 % $ 221 12.5 The increase in salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation were primarily attributable to an increase in headcount of approximately 460 personnel, bringing headcount to approximately 7,260 at December31, 2011, which represents a 6.8% increase from our December31, 2010 levels. Development and design costs vary from period to period depending on the timing development and tape-out of various products. The increase in the Other line item in the above table is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation, travel and facilities expenses.
We expect research and development costs to increase as a result of growth in, and the diversification of, the markets we serve, new product opportunities, the number of design wins that go into production, changes in our compensation policies, and any expansion into new markets and technologies.
We remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate. Approximately 61.3% of our products are currently manufactured in 65 nanometers. We are designing most new products in 40nanometers and 28 nanometers, and are beginning to evaluate 20 nanometers. We currently hold more than 6,000 U.S. and more than 2,550 foreign patents and more than 7,350 additional U.S. and foreign pending patent applications. We maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional U.S. and foreign patents in wired and wireless communications and other fields.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, legal and other professional fees, facilities expenses and communications expenses.
40 Table of Contents The following table presents details of selling, general and administrative expense: Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2011 2010 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Salaries and benefits $ 293 4.0 % $ 240 3.5 % $ 53 22.1 % Stock-based compensation 126 1.7 119 1.7 7 5.9 Legal and accounting fees 149 2.0 140 2.1 9 6.4 Other 114 1.5 91 1.4 23 25.3 Selling, general and administrative $ 682 9.2 % $ 590 8.7 % $ 92 15.6 The increase in salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation were primarily attributable to an increase in headcount of approximately 140 personnel, bringing headcount to approximately 1,750 at December31, 2011, which represents an 8.9% increase from our December31, 2010 levels. The increase in legal and accounting fees primarily related to legal fees associated with the federal consolidated shareholder derivative settlement, which included a final $25 million payment to the plaintiffs counsel for attorneys fees, expenses and costs. Legal fees consist primarily of attorneys fees and expenses related to our outstanding intellectual property and prior years securities litigation, patent prosecution and filings and various other transactions. Legal fees fluctuate from period to period due to the nature, scope, timing and costs of the matters in litigation. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The increase in the Other line item in the above table is primarily attributable to an increase in travel and facilities expense.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense The following table presents details of total stock-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income discussed above: Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2011 2010 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Cost of product revenue $ 24 0.3 % $ 23 0.3 % $ 1 4.3 % Research and development 364 4.9 341 5.0 23 6.7 Selling, general and administrative 126 1.7 119 1.7 7 5.9 $ 514 6.9 % $ 483 7.0 % $ 31 6.4 The following table presents details of unearned stock-based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in 2012 through 2015 related to unvested share-based payment awards: 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total (In millions) Unearned stock-based compensation $ 357 $ 228 $ 119 $ 21 $ 725 If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future stock-based compensation expense and unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions. The increase in stock-based compensation in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily related to the commencement of a new two-year offering period under our employee stock purchase program, which resulted in a $36 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as compared to 2010.
It is our long-term objective that total stock-based compensation approximates 5% of total net revenue.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents details of the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in the cost of product revenue and other operating expense categories: Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2011 2010 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Cost of product revenue $ 54 0.7 % $ 31 0.5 % $ 23 74.2 % Other operating expenses 30 0.4 28 0.4 2 7.1 $ 84 1.1 % $ 59 0.9 % $ 25 42.4 The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily related to our acquisitions of Beceem Communications, Inc. in late 2010 and Provigent in 2011.
The following table presents details of the amortization of existing purchased intangible assets, including IPR&D, which is currently estimated to be expensed in 2012 and thereafter.
Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization by Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In millions) Cost of product revenue $ 77 $ 72 $ 60 $ 46 $ 33 $ 56 $ 344 Other operating expenses 27 10 4 4 4 7 56 $ 104 $ 82 $ 64 $ 50 $ 37 $ 63 $ 400 If we acquire additional purchased intangible assets in the future, including purchased intangible assets related to our pending acquisition of NetLogic, our cost of product revenue or operating expenses will be increased by the amortization of those assets.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets We performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill in October 2011 and 2010. Upon completion of these assessments, we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. We also believe that we have no at-risk goodwill. We recorded a purchased intangible impairment charge of $74 million related to our acquisition of Beceem and other impairment charges of $18 million in 2011. The primary factor contributing to the Beceem impairment charge was a reduction in the forecasted cash flows related to WiMAX products, as wireless service providers have accelerated their adoption of LTE products. In 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of $19million, primarily related to a technology license that was acquired in 2008 from Sunext Design, Inc. For the carrying balances of our goodwill by reporting segment and a description of our valuation techniques and significant assumptions as well as details of our other long-lived assets impairment charges taken, see the discussions in Notes 2 and 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Restructuring Costs As discussed above in Operating Results for the Year Ended December31, 2011, we recorded an aggregate of $16 million in net restructuring costs in 2011, of which $12 million was related to severance and other charges associated with our reduction in workforce across multiple locations and functions, and $4 million was related to the closure of three of our facilities. We do not expect any cost savings as we plan to reallocate funding to higher return opportunities. We currently expect to complete this plan and record additional costs of approximately $1 million in the three months ended March31, 2012.
42 Table of Contents Settlement Costs (Gains), Net In 2011 we recorded settlement gains of $55 million primarily related to the settlement of our shareholder derivative action, partially offset by net settlement costs of $37 million related to patent infringement claims, resulting in net settlement gains of $18 million. In 2010 we recorded settlement costs of $53million primarily related to licensing and settlement agreements and certain employment tax items.
For a further discussion of our settlement costs and litigation matters, see Notes 11 and 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In-Process Research and Development In 2011 and 2010 we capitalized IPR&D of $45 million and $55 million, respectively. For a description of our valuation techniques and significant assumptions underlying the valuation of the ongoing development projects that were in process at the date of acquisition and were capitalized as IPR&D in 2011 and 2010, see the discussion in Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2011 and 2010 we reclassified $3 million and $51million, respectively, of IPR&D costs to developed technology, primarily related to our acquisition of Dune Networks, Inc., which will now be amortized to cost of product revenue.
Charitable Contributions In April 2009 we established the Broadcom Foundation, or the Foundation, to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs, as well as a broad range of community services. In June 2011 we contributed an additional $25 million to the Foundation. Approximately $2 million of the $25 million contribution came from Dr.Henry Samueli, our Chief Technical Officer and member of the Board of Directors, who made such payment to Broadcom in connection with the settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation as further described in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This payment was recorded as an operating expense in consolidated statement of income in 2011.
Interest and Other Income, Net The following table presents interest and other income, net: Year Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2011 2010 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Interest income (expense), net $ (5 ) (0.1 %) $ 9 0.1 % $ (14 ) (155.6 )% Other income, net 8 0.1 6 0.1 2 33.3 Interest income (expense), net, reflects interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances offset by interest expense on our Senior Notes totaling $1.20 billion. Other income, net, primarily includes gains on foreign currency transactions.
The decrease in interest income (expense), net, for 2011 as compared to 2010 was driven primarily by interest expense related to our newly issued long-term debt. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2011 2010 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Income tax provision $ 29 0.3 % $ 15 0.2 % $ 14 93.3 % The federal statutory rate was 35% for 2011 and 2010. Our effective tax rates were 3.0% and 1.4% for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The differences between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rate primarily 43 Table of Contents relate to foreign earnings taxed at substantially lower rates than the federal statutory rate for 2011 and 2010 due principally to our tax holiday in Singapore, and for 2011 and 2010 domestic tax losses recorded without tax benefits. We recorded a tax provision of $13 million in 2011 resulting from legislation enacted in Israel on December5, 2011 which increased tax rates for 2012 and later years applicable to our Israel net deferred tax liabilities, principally related to purchased intangible assets. We realized tax benefits resulting from the reversal of certain prior period taxaccruals of $9million and $12million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. These reversals resulted primarily from the expiration of the statutes of limitation for the assessment of taxes related to certain foreign subsidiaries.Additionally, as a result of the March22, 2010 decision in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit case concerning Xilinx, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately$3million in 2010 to reverse the approximately $3million of related exposure previously recorded in 2009. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed discussions of our income taxes.
We operate under tax holidays in Singapore, which are effective through March 2014. The tax holidays are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of the Singapore tax holidays decreased Singapore taxes by $368million and $330million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was $0.65 and $0.61 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. We have begun discussions with the Singapore Economic Development Board with respect to tax incentives for periods after March31, 2014.
Years Ended December31, 2010 and 2009 Net Revenue, Cost of Product Revenue, Product Gross Margin, and Total Gross Margin The following tables present net revenue, cost of product revenue, product gross margin and total gross margin: Year Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Product revenue $ 6,589 96.7 % $ 4,273 95.2 % $ 2,316 54.2 % Income from Qualcomm Agreement 207 3.0 171 3.8 36 21.1 Licensing revenue 22 0.3 46 1.0 (24 ) (52.2 ) Total net revenue $ 6,818 100.0 % $ 4,490 100.0 % $ 2,328 51.8 Cost of product revenue $ 3,284 48.2 % $ 2,211 49.2 % $ 1,073 48.5 Product gross margin 50.2 % 48.3 % 1.9 % Total gross margin 51.8 % 50.8 % 1.0 % The following table presents net revenue from each of our reportable segments and its respective contribution to net revenue: Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Broadband Communications $ 2,134 31.3 % $ 1,525 34.0 % $ 609 39.9 % Mobile & Wireless 2,889 42.4 1,720 38.3 1,169 68.0 Infrastructure & Networking 1,588 23.3 1,056 23.5 532 50.4 All other (1) 207 3.0 189 4.2 18 9.5 Total net revenue $ 6,818 100.0 % $ 4,490 100.0 % $ 2,328 51.8 44 Table of Contents (1) Includes (i)income relating to the Qualcomm Agreement that was entered into in April 2009, (ii)royalties received pursuant to a patent license agreement that was entered into with Verizon Wireless in July 2007 which was completed in March 2009 and (iii)other revenue from certain patent agreements, each previously reported in our Mobile& Wireless reportable segment. See Notes1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The increase in net revenue from our Broadband Communications reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for digital set-top boxes and broadband modems. The increase in net revenue from our Mobile& Wireless reportable segment resulted primarily from the increase in demand for our wireless connectivity combo solutions, as well as the ramp of our cellular products. The increase in net revenue from our Infrastructure& Networking reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our Ethernet switching products. The increase in our All Other category was the result of a $36 million increase in income received from the Qualcomm Agreement, offset in part by a $19 million decrease in licensing revenue from our agreement with Verizon Wireless, which was completed in March 2009.
We recorded rebates to certain customers of $526million, or 7.7% of net revenue and $312million, or 6.9% of net revenue in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in rebates in 2010 was attributable to the increase in net revenue along with a change to the mix in sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs, primarily an increase in the Mobile& Wireless reportable segment. We reversed accrued rebates of $4million and $11million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Cost of Product Revenue, Product Gross Margin and Total Gross Margin.
Product gross margin increased from 48.3% in 2009 to 50.2% in 2010 primarily as a result of cost reductions in each of our reportable segments as we continued our transition to 40 nanometer process technology. Other factors that contributed to the increase in product gross margin were: (i)fixed costs being spread over a higher revenue base (ii)higher margins in our infrastructure and networking products offset by (iii)a net increase in excess and obsolete inventory provisions of $7million due to an increase in the provision for digital TV products.
Research and Development Expense The following table presents details of research and development expense: Year Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Salaries and benefits $ 929 13.6 % $ 770 17.2 % $ 159 20.6 % Stock-based compensation 341 5.0 352 7.8 (11 ) (3.1 ) Development and design costs 274 4.0 211 4.7 63 29.9 Other 218 3.1 202 4.5 16 7.9 Research and development $ 1,762 25.7 % $ 1,535 34.2 % $ 227 14.8 The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount of approximately 1,300personnel; bringing total headcount to approximately 6,800personnel. This represents a 23.6% increase from our December31, 2009 levels, and was predominantly in each of our reportable segments as a result of both organic growth and our 2010 acquisitions. Salary increases were also attributable to increased incentive compensation. Development and design costs increased due to increases in mask, prototyping, testing and engineering design tool costs stemming from our continued transition of products to 40 nanometer process technologies. Development and design costs vary from period to period depending on the timing, development and tape-out of various products.
45 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expense The following table presents details of selling, general and administrative expense: Year Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Salaries and benefits $ 240 3.5 % $ 194 4.3 % $ 46 23.7 % Stock-based compensation 119 1.7 120 2.7 (1 ) (0.8 ) Legal and accounting fees 140 2.1 110 2.5 30 27.3 Other 91 1.4 55 1.2 36 65.5 Selling, general and administrative $ 590 8.7 % $ 479 10.7 % $ 111 23.2 The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to an increase in headcount of approximately 300personnel, which represents a 23.1% increase from our December31, 2009 levels, as well as higher incentive compensation. The increase in legal and accounting fees in 2010 was primarily related to a 2009 recovery of legal fees of $91million under our directors and officers insurance policies, which reduced our 2009 legal fees. Legal fees consist primarily of attorneys fees and expenses related to our outstanding intellectual property and prior years stock option backdating securities litigation, patent prosecution and filings and various other transactions. Legal fees fluctuate from period to period due to the nature, scope, timing and costs of the matters in litigation. See Note12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The increase in the Other line item in the above table is primarily attributable to an increase in facilities and travel expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense The following table presents details of total stock-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income discussed above: Year Ended December31, Decrease % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Cost of product revenue $ 23 0.3 % $ 25 0.5 % $ (2 ) (8.0 )% Research and development 341 5.0 352 7.8 (11 ) (3.1 ) Selling, general and administrative 119 1.7 120 2.7 (1 ) (0.8 ) $ 483 7.0 % $ 497 11.0 % $ (14 ) (2.8 ) See Note9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of share-based awards.

Upon completion of our October 2010 and 2009 annual impairment assessments, we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. In 2010 we recorded a purchased intangible impairment charge of $19million, primarily related to a technology license that was acquired in 2008 from Sunext. In 2009 we recorded impairment charges to customer relationships, developed technology and certain other assets of $19million related to the acquisition of the DTV Business of AMD in 2008. For a description of our valuation techniques and significant assumptions as well as details of our other long-lived assets impairment charges taken, see the discussions in Note 2 and Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Settlement Costs (Gains) We recorded settlement costs of $53million in 2010 primarily related to licensing and settlement agreements and certain employment tax items. In 2009 we incurred settlement costs of $184million, partially offset by settlement gains of $66million, resulting in $118million of net settlement costs.
In December 2009 we agreed in principle to the settlement of the Stock Option Class Actions. We subsequently entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement of the Stock Option ClassActions dated as of April30, 2010, which provides for the claims against Broadcom and its current and former officers and directors to be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $161million cash payment by Broadcom. We recorded the settlement amount as a one-time charge in our statement of income for the three months and year ended December31, 2009 and subsequent payment was made in June 2010 into a settlement fund.
For further discussion of our settlement costs and litigation matters, see Notes 11 and12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We recorded settlement gains of $65million related to the Qualcomm Agreement in 2009. In addition, we recorded settlement costs of $12million related to a payment to the Israeli government associated with a post-acquisition technology transfer fee related to our acquisition of Dune Networks, Inc. We also recorded $11million in settlement costs in 2009 for estimated settlements associated with certain employment tax items, other employment matters and a patent infringement claim.
In-Process Research and Development In 2010 and 2009 we capitalized IPR&D of $55 million and $50 million, respectively. For a description of our valuation techniques and significant assumptions underlying the valuation of the ongoing development projects that were in process at the date of acquisition and were capitalized as IPR&D in 2011 and 2010, see the discussion Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2010 we reclassified $51million of IPR&D costs to developed technology, primarily related to our acquisition of Dune Networks, Inc., which will now be amortized to cost of product revenue.
Charitable Contribution In 2009 we made an unrestricted grant of $50million to the Foundation upon receiving a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income taxation under Section501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We recorded an operating expense for the contribution of $50million in 2009. We did not make any contributions to the Foundation in 2010.
47 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents interest and other income (expense), net: Year Ended December31, Increase (Decrease) % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Interest income, net $ 9 0.1 % $ 14 0.3 % $ (5 ) (35.7 )% Other income, net 6 0.1 2 0.1 4 200.0 The decrease in interest income, net, was the result of interest expense related to long-term debt and the overall decrease in market interest rates. Our cash and marketable securities balances increased from $2.37billion at December31, 2009 to $4.06billion at December31, 2010, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from exercise of stock options and stock purchase rights and proceeds from the issuance of our long-term debt. The average interest rates earned in 2010 and 2009 were 0.43% and 0.63%, respectively. The decrease in the average interest rate is a reflection of reinvestment in the current low interest rate environment.
The increase in other income, net was primarily the result of a gain on strategic investments.
Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December31, Increase % Change 2010 2009 Amount %ofNet Revenue Amount %ofNet Revenue (In millions, except percentages) Income tax provision $ 15 0.2 % $ 7 0.1 % $ 8 114.3 % The federal statutory rate was 35% for 2010 and 2009. Our effective tax rates were 1.4% and 9.6% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The differences between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rate primarily relate to foreign earnings taxed at substantially lower rates than the federal statutory rate for 2010 and 2009 due principally to our tax holiday in Singapore, and for 2010 and 2009 domestic tax losses recorded without tax benefits. We recognized federal tax benefits of approximately $3million in 2009, which resulted from the utilization of a portion of our federal credits for increasing research activities (research and development tax credits) pursuant to a provision contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009, which was enacted in February, 2009. In addition, we realized tax benefits resulting from the reversal of certain prior period taxaccruals of $12million and $8million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. These reversals resulted primarily from the expiration of the statutes of limitation for the assessment of taxes related to certain foreign subsidiaries.Additionally, as a result of the May27, 2009 and March22, 2010 decisions in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit case concerning Xilinx, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately$3million in 2010 to reverse the approximately $3million of related exposure previously recorded in 2009. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed discussions of our income taxes.
We operate under tax holidays in Singapore, which are effective through March 2014. The tax holidays are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of the Singapore tax holidays decreased Singapore taxes by $330million and $225million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was $0.61 and $0.44 for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
At December31, 2010 we had unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $188million which included $23million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. Approximately $12million of the tax benefit, if recognized would be credited to shareholders equity. The remaining $153million, if recognized, would not result in a tax benefit since it would be fully offset with a valuation allowance. We also accrued potential penalties and interest of $2million and $1million, respectively, related to these unrecognized tax benefits during 2010, and in total, as of December31, 2010, we had recorded liabilities for potential penalties and interest of $14million and $2million, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to 48 Table of Contents unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of income as income tax expense. In 2010 we had a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $273million relating to increases to our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized research and development costs, and tax credit carryforwards for previous years primarily resulting from the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit March22, 2010 ruling in the case between Xilinx, Inc. and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In addition, we had an increase in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $39million primarily relating to transactions with certain foreign subsidiaries. In 2009 our judgment changed with respect to prior period uncertain tax positions, which resulted in additional unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of approximately $380million as of December31, 2009. In 2010 we reversed approximately $273million of this amount due to the March22, 2010 decision in the Xilinx case as discussed above, and recorded $23million of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from a 2010 change in judgment regarding certain tax accruals.
Quarterly Financial Data The following table presents our quarterly financial data. In our opinion, this information has been prepared on a basis consistent with that of our audited consolidated financial statements and all necessary material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments, have been included to present fairly the quarterly financial data.

Subsequent Events In January 2012 our Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the existing dividend policy pursuant to which we intend to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 11.1% to $0.10 per share ($0.40 per share on an annual basis) and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable to holders of our common stock.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011 the FASB issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements, changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In June 2011 the FASB issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but 49 Table of Contents consecutive statements. The updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

The following table presents working capital, and cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities: December31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 (In millions) Working capital $ 4,653 $ 2,913 $ 1,740 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,146 $ 1,622 $ 2,524 Short-term marketable securities 383 1,035 (652 ) Long-term marketable securities 676 1,401 (725 ) $ 5,205 $ 4,058 $ 1,147 See the summary of cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term marketable securities by major security type and discussion of market risk that follows in Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Cash Provided and Used in 2011 and 2010 Cash and cash equivalents increased to $4.15billion at December31, 2011 from $1.62billion at December31, 2010 as a result of cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from marketable securities, proceeds from the issuance of our long-term debt, and the issuance of our ClassA common stock, offset in part by repurchases of our ClassA common stock, net cash paid for acquired companies, our quarterly dividend payments and net purchases of property and equipment.
Year Ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,838 $ 1,371 $ 987 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 863 (2,179 ) (502 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (177 ) 1,033 (279 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents 2,524 225 206 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 1,622 1,397 1,191 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 4,146 $ 1,622 $ 1,397 Operating Activities In 2011 our operating activities provided $1.84 billion in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $927 million, net non-cash operating expenses of $784 million and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $127 million. In 2010 our operating activities provided $1.37 billion in cash. This was primarily the result of net income of $1.08 billion and net non-cash operating expenses of $638 million, offset in part by net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $349 million, which includes our $161 million payment of previously accrued securities litigation settlement costs.
Our days sales outstanding decreased to 34 days for the three months ended December31, 2011 as compared to 38 days for the three months ended December31, 2010 due to our revenue linearity. We typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms. If, in the longer term, our revenue increases, it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase. Our accounts receivable could also 50 Table of Contents increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers, both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may have difficulty gaining access to sufficient credit on a timely basis.
Our inventory days on hand decreased from 57 days at December31, 2010 to 43 days at December31, 2011, primarily attributable to inventory management. In the future, our inventory levels will continue to be determined by the level of purchase orders we receive and the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles, our ability, and the ability of our customers, to manage inventory under hubbing arrangements, and competitive situations in the marketplace. Such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels.
Investing Activities Investing activities provided $863 million in cash in 2011. This was primarily the result of $1.38 billion in net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities in anticipation of our acquisition of NetLogic in the first half of 2012, offset in part by $347 million in net cash paid for our acquisitions of Provigent and SC Square and $163 million of capital equipment purchases to support our research and development efforts. Investing activities used $2.18 billion in cash in 2010, which was primarily the result of $1.47 billion in net purchases of marketable securities, $599 million in net cash paid primarily for the acquisitions of Teknovus, Innovision, Percello, Beceem and Gigle, and $109 million of capital equipment purchases, mostly to support our research and development efforts.
Financing Activities Our financing activities used $177 million in cash in 2011. This was primarily the result of $670 million in repurchases of shares of our ClassA common stock, dividends paid of $194 million, and $155 million in minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for shares issued pursuant to restricted stock units, offset in part by $494 million in proceeds from the issuance of our long-term debt and $348 million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities provided $1.03 billion in cash in 2010, which was primarily the result of $936 million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and $691 million in proceeds from the issuance of our long-term debt, offset in part by $280 million in repurchases of shares of our ClassA common stock, dividends paid of $163 million, repayment of debt assumed in our Teknovus acquisition of $15 million, and $136 million in minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for shares issued pursuant to restricted stock units.
The timing and number of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises and purchases are not within our control, and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past. Moreover, it is now our general practice to issue a combination of time-based and performance-based RSUs only to certain employees and, in most cases to issue solely time-based RSUs. While we may issue stock options in the future, we currently plan to do so only in connection with acquisitions. Unlike the exercise of stock options, the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to Broadcom and requires the use of cash, as we currently allow employees to elect to have a portion of the shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock units withheld to satisfy minimum statutory withholding taxes, which we then pay in cash to the appropriate tax authorities on each participating employees behalf.
Short and Long-Term Financing Arrangements At December31, 2011, we had the following resources available to obtain short-term or long-term financings if we need additional liquidity: Registration Statements Wehave aForm S-3 universal shelf registration statement and a Form S-4acquisition shelf registration statement onfile with the SEC. The universal shelf registration statement on FormS-3 permits Broadcom to sell, in one or more public offerings, shares of our ClassA common stock, shares of preferred stock or debt securities, or any 51 Table of Contents combination of such securities, for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $1.50billion. The 2018 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million that weissued in November 2011 (more fully described in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) were issued pursuant tothe Form S-3.The Form S-3 will expire in accordance with applicable SEC rules on February27, 2012. The acquisition shelf registration statement on FormS-4 enables us to issue up to 30million shares of our ClassA common stock in one or more acquisition transactions. These transactions may include the acquisition of assets, businesses or securities by any form of business combination. To date no securities have been issued pursuant to the S-4 registration statement, which does not have an expiration date mandated by SEC rules.
Credit Facility In November 2010 we entered into a credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $500million. We amended this credit facility in October 2011 primarily to extend the maturity date by two years to November19, 2016, at which time all outstanding revolving facility loans (if any) and accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid. The amendment to the credit facility also decreased the interest rate margins applicable to loans made under the credit facility and the commitment fee paid on the amount of the unused commitments. We did not draw on our credit facility in 2011 or 2010.
The credit facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. Financial covenants require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00.
We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December31, 2011.
Senior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior unsecured notes: December31, Increase 2011 2010 (In millions) 1.500% fixed-rate notes, due 2013 $ 300 $ 300 $  2.375% fixed-rate notes, due 2015 400 400  2.700% fixed-rate notes, due 2018 500  500 Total $ 1,200 $ 700 $ 500 In November 2010 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $700million. These notes consist of $300million aggregate principal amount which mature in November 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.500%per annum, and $400million aggregate principal amount which mature in November 2015, or the 2015 Notes, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.375%per annum. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes were utilized for general corporate purposes.
In November 2011 we issued senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amount of $500 million which mature in November 2018 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.700%per annum, or the 2018 Notes. Proceeds from the 2018 Notes are expected to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration for NetLogic.
The 2018 Notes are subject to a mandatory redemption in the event Broadcoms proposed acquisition of NetLogic is not consummated on or prior to August31, 2012, or if prior to August31, 2012, the Agreement and Plan of Merger is terminated. In such an event, the 2018 Notes will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principle amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to grant liens on assets; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or merge, consolidate or sell assets. Failure to comply with these covenants, or any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes.
52 Table of Contents We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December31, 2011.
See Note6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on our financing arrangements.
Other Notes and Borrowings We had no other significant notes or borrowings as of December31, 2011.
Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December31, 2011: Payment Obligations by Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating leases $ 121 $ 120 $ 90 $ 76 $ 69 $ 123 $ 599 Inventory and related purchase obligations 468      468 Other obligations 147 35 31 30 23 3 269 Long-term debt and related interest 27 328 23 423 13 527 1,341 $ 763 $ 483 $ 144 $ 529 $ 105 $ 653 $ 2,677 We lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements. Our leased facilities comprise an aggregate of 3.6million square feet. Our principal facilities in Irvine have lease terms that expire at various dates through 2017 with an aggregate rent of $130million (included in the table above).
Inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services. We depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services. Due to lengthy subcontractor lead times, we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the ensuing six months. Our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders, but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation. To date we have not incurred significant cancellation charges.
Other obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment, computer hardware, information systems infrastructure, mask and prototyping costs, intellectual property licensing arrangements and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business.
For purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon. We have additional purchase orders (not included in the table above) that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.
Unrecognized tax benefits were $212million, of which $25million would result in potential cash payment of taxes and $187million would result in a reduction in net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We are not including any amount related to uncertain tax positions in the table presented above because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of settlements with the respective taxing authorities. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, we have also recorded a liability for potential tax penalties and interest of $11million and $3million, respectively, at December31, 2011.
Prospective Capital Needs We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations and from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans, will be 53 Table of Contents sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, commitments, repurchases of our ClassA common stock and quarterly dividends for at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may choose to raise additional funds or draw on our existing credit facility to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies, including our pending acquisition of NetLogic. If needed, we may be able to raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial institutions. We could also reduce certain expenditures, such as repurchases of our ClassA common stock.
We expect our acquisition of NetLogic for $50 per share, or approximately $3.7 billion, net of cash assumed, to close in the first half of 2012. We currently expect to fund the acquisition with our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. For at least the next 12 months, we have sufficient cash in the U.S. and expect domestic cash flow to sustain our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as acquisitions, quarterly dividends, share buy-backs and repayment of debt. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months.
If we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations, any taxable income that could result from the repatriation of our foreign earnings would be offset by our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards, which are currently subject to a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, and would not be expected to have a material effect on our tax liabilities.
In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or utilize or increase our existing credit facilities for other reasons. However, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on a timely basis at acceptable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our ClassA common stock.
As of December31, 2011 we have approximately $1.93 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the June30, 2011 closing of our IRS audit and agreed adjustments to income for the 2001 through 2006 tax years, $802 million was paid from our foreign subsidiaries to Broadcom Corporation during the three months ended September30, 2011. This amount was not subject to additional income tax. The income resulting from the IRS adjustments was offset by net operating loss carryforwards. Any potential additional income, which could result if we were to repatriate the remaining $1.93 billion of foreign cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would be offset by existing net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards and should not have a material effect on our tax liabilities. Our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards are currently subject to a full valuation allowance.
Although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. We anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors, including:  general economic and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry, trends in the wired and wireless communications markets in various geographic regions, including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated;  acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies;  the unavailability of credit and financing, which may lead certain of our customers to reduce their levels of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us;  litigation expenses, settlements and judgments;  the overall levels of sales of our semiconductor products, licensing revenue, income from the Qualcomm Agreement and product gross margins; 54 Table of Contents  our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans, and product and technology roadmaps;  the market acceptance of our products;  payment of cash dividends;  required levels of research and development and other operating costs;  repurchases of our ClassA common stock;  volume price discounts and customer rebates;  intellectual property disputes, customer indemnification claims and other types of litigation risks;  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain;  licensing royalties payable by us;  changes in our compensation policies;  the issuance of restricted stock units and the related cash payments we make for withholding taxes due from employees;  capital improvements for new and existing facilities;  technological advances;  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products;  our relationships with suppliers and customers;  the availability and cost of sufficient foundry, assembly and test capacity and packaging materials; and  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan.
In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future long-term growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December31, 2011 we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We manage our total portfolio to encompass a diversified pool of investment-grade securities to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. The average credit rating of our marketable securities portfolio by major credit rating agencies was Aa2/AA. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income, net, may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded fixed income investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any fixed income securities we hold are classified as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders equity, net of tax.
In the current interest rate environment, as short-term investments mature, reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates. Given the short-term nature of certain investments, the current interest rate environment may continue to negatively impact our investment income.
To assess the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of December31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of December31, 2010, a similar 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $23 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.
55 Table of Contents Actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December31, 2011 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions.
A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in short-term interest rates would not have a material impact on our revolving credit facility, which bears a floating interest rate. This sensitivity analysis assumes all other variables will remain constant in future periods.
Our Senior Notes bear fixed interest rates, and therefore, would not be subject to interest rate risk.
Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Currently, sales to customers and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future.
Other Risks We believe we do not have material direct or indirect exposure to European sovereign or non-sovereign debt.

Item9A.
Controls and Procedures We are committed to maintaining disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures and implementing controls and procedures based on the application of managements judgment.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December31, 2011, the end of the period covered by this Report.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
56 Table of Contents Inherent Limitations on Internal Control A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of management override or improper acts, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to management override, error or improper acts may occur and not be detected. Any resulting misstatement or loss may have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV.

59 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Broadcom Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the consolidated financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Broadcom Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2011 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Testing Goodwill for Impairment , and in 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 605, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements , and FASB ASC Topic 985, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Broadcom Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February1, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Broadcom Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Broadcom Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Broadcom Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February1, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

F-6 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December31, 2011 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Broadcom Corporation (including our subsidiaries, referred to collectively in this Report as Broadcom, we, our and us) is a global innovation leader in semiconductor solutions for wired and wireless communications. Broadcom products seamlessly deliver voice, video, data and multimedia connectivity in the home, the office and the mobile environment. We provide the industrys broadest portfolio of state-of-the-art system-on-a-chip, or SoC, and software solutions.
Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and our subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In 2011 we early adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Testing Goodwill for Impairment . In 2010 we adopted the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 605, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangement , and FASB ASC Topic 985, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements . The adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency The functional currency for most of our international operations is the U.S.dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates on the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Any translation adjustments resulting from this process are shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in other income, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of total net revenue and expenses in the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, rebates, allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, warranty obligations, inventory valuation, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations, strategic investments, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, self-insurance, restructuring costs or reversals, litigation and other loss contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results we experience may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.
Revenue Recognition We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, royalties and license fees for our intellectual property and software and related services. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized for each arrangement depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (i)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii)delivery has occurred, (iii)the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and F-7 Table of Contents (iv)collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. These criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment. However, we do not recognize revenue when any future performance obligations remain. We record reductions of revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as competitive pricing programs and rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor. We reverse the accrual for unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. See Note 2 for a summary of our rebate activity.
Multiple Element Arrangements Excluding Software We occasionally enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met for each deliverable in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the arrangement consideration between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could affect our results of operations. When we enter into an arrangement that includes multiple elements, the allocation of value to each element is derived based on managements best estimate of selling price when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable.
Distributor Revenue A portion of our product sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and/or rights of return. These pricing credits and/or right of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the inventory to be sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements. As a result, the fixed and determinable revenue recognition criterion has not been met at the time we deliver products to our distributors. Accordingly, product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers.
Software, Royalties and Cancellation Fee Revenue Revenue from software licenses is recognized when all of the software revenue recognition criteria are met and, if applicable, when vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists to allocate the total license fee to each element of multiple-element software arrangements, including post-contract customer support. Post-contract support is recognized ratably over the support period. When a contract contains multiple elements wherein the only undelivered element is post-contract customer support and VSOE of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Software royalty revenue is recognized in arrears on a quarterly basis, based upon reports received from licensees during the period, unless collectability is not reasonably assured, in which case revenue is recognized when payment is received from the licensee. Revenue from cancellation fees is recognized when cash is received from the customer.
Licensing Revenue We license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or utilized in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to ten years. We recognize licensing revenue on the sale of patents when all of the following criteria are met: (i)persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist, (ii)delivery has occurred, (iii)the price to be paid by the purchaser is fixed or determinable and (iv)collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured. These criteria are usually met at the time of patent transfer. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees and when other revenue recognition criteria are met, which is generally a quarter in arrears from the period earned.
F-8 Table of Contents Income from the Qualcomm Agreement On April26, 2009 we entered into a four-year Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement, or the Qualcomm Agreement, with Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm. The Qualcomm Agreement is a multiple element arrangement which includes: (i)an exchange of intellectual property rights, including in certain circumstances, by a series of covenants not to assert claims of patent infringement under future patents issued within one to four years of the execution date of the agreement, (ii)the assignment of certain existing patents by Broadcom to Qualcomm with Broadcom retaining a royalty-free license under these patents, and (iii)the settlement of all outstanding litigation and claims between us and Qualcomm. The proceeds of the Qualcomm Agreement were allocated amongst the principal elements of the transaction. A gain of $65 million from the settlement of litigation was immediately recognized as a reduction in settlement costs that approximates the value of awards determined by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The remaining consideration was predominantly associated with the transfer of current and future intellectual property rights and is being recognized within net revenue over the performance period of four years as a single unit of accounting. However this income will be limited to the lesser of the cumulative straight-line amortization over the four year performance period or the cumulative cash proceeds received.
Deferred Revenue and Income We defer revenue and income when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Deferred revenue does not include amounts from products delivered to distributors that the distributors have not yet sold through to their end customers.
Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue comprises the cost of our semiconductor devices, which consists of the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries, costs associated with our purchase of assembly, test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products, as well as royalties paid to vendors for use of their technology. Also included in cost of product revenue is the amortization of purchased technology, and manufacturing overhead, including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support, product warranty costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support.
Concentration of Credit Risk We sell the majority of our products throughout North America, Asia and Europe. Sales to our recurring customers are generally made on open account while sales to occasional customers are typically made on a prepaid or letter of credit basis. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our recurring customers and generally do not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses, which losses historically have not been significant.
We invest our cash in U.S.Treasury instruments, in deposits and money market funds with major financial institutions and in commercial paper, asset-backed securities and corporate and agency bonds. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. It is generally our policy to invest in instruments that have a final maturity of no longer than three years, with a portfolio weighted average maturity of no longer than 18months.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. The fair value of our long-term debt is determined by using estimated market prices. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether or not the inputs are observable in the F-9 Table of Contents market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is prioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows: Level 1: Inputs are based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.
Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and/or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active near the measurement date.
Level 3: Inputs include managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instruments valuation.
The fair value of the majority of our cash equivalents and marketable securities was determined based on Level 1 inputs. The fair value of certain marketable securities and our long-term debt were determined based on Level 2 inputs. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our Level 2 instruments were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We do not have any marketable securities in the Level 3 category. We believe that the recorded values of all our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The cost of these investments approximates their fair value. We maintain an investment portfolio of various security holdings, types and maturities. We define marketable securities as income yielding securities that can be readily converted into cash. Marketable securities short-term and long-term classifications are based on remaining maturities at each reporting period. Examples of marketable securities include U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, commercial paper, asset-back securities and corporate bonds. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet various parameters, including credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy. We do not use derivative financial instruments.
We account for our investments in debt and equity instruments as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders equity, net of tax. We assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired. Unrealized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income, net in the consolidated statements of income.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customers ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale, we will record an allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience.
Inventory Inventory consists of work in process and finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. We write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, among other factors. Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of product revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Inventory acquired through business combinations is recorded at its acquisition date fair value which is the net realizable value less a normal profit margin depending on the stage of inventory completion.
F-10 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the assets estimated remaining useful lives, ranging from one to ten years. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements are computed using the shorter of the remaining lease term or ten years.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets. Other long-lived assets primarily represent purchased intangible assets including developed technology, customer relationships and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to fifteen years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We capitalize IPR&D projects acquired as part of a business combination. On completion of each project, IPR&D assets are reclassified to developed technology and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In 2011 we early adopted the new provisions issued by the FASB that intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing. The updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. We determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach, as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount, by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.
During development, IPR&D is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Once an IPR&D project is complete, it becomes a definite lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for long-lived assets.
We test long-lived assets and purchased intangible assets (other than goodwill and IPR&D in development) for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist. We determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable, based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset are expected to generate. If an asset is not recoverable, we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and purchased intangible assets.
Warranty Our products typically carry a one to three year warranty. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon our historical warranty experience, and additionally for any known product warranty issues. If actual costs differ from our initial estimates, we record the difference in the period they are identified. Actual claims are charged against the warranty reserve. See Note2 for a summary of our warranty activity.
Guarantees and Indemnifications In some agreements to which we are a party, we have agreed to indemnify the other party for certain matters, including, but not limited to product liability. We include intellectual property indemnification provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale for our products and have also included such provisions in certain agreements with third parties. We have and will continue to evaluate and provide reasonable assistance for these other parties.
F-11 Table of Contents This may include certain levels of financial support to minimize the impact of the litigation in which they are involved. To date, there have been no known events or circumstances that have resulted in any material costs related to these indemnification provisions and no liabilities therefor have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. However, the maximum potential amount of the future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant.
We have obligations to indemnify certain of our present and former directors, officers and employees to the maximum extent not prohibited by law. Under these obligations, Broadcom is required (subject to certain exceptions) to indemnify each such director, officer and employee against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and settlements, paid by such individual. The potential amount of the future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant. We maintain directors and officers insurance policies that may generally limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of the amounts paid with respect to such obligations.
Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of income as income tax expense.
Research and Development Expense Research and development expenditures are expensed in the period incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation Broadcom has in effect stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. We also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. We are required to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant. The value of the award is principally recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. The fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our ClassA common stock on the date of grant less our expected dividend yield. We have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant or assumption using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable. The Black-Scholes model considers, among other factors, the expected life of the award, the expected volatility of our stock price and the expected dividend yield. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights on a quarterly basis. The fair values generated by the Black-Scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards, as it does not consider other factors important to those awards to employees, such as continued employment, periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability.
Litigation and Settlement Costs Legal costs are expensed as incurred. We are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. We continually evaluate uncertainties associated with litigation and record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i)information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii)the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. This generally occurs when an agreement in principle has been reached by both parties that include substantive terms, conditions and amounts. We account for settlement agreements as multiple F-12 Table of Contents element arrangements and allocate the consideration to the identifiable elements based on relative fair value. Generally the identifiable elements are the licensing of intellectual property for future use and payments related to alleged prior infringement.
Self-Insurance We are self-insured for certain healthcare benefits provided to our U.S.employees. The liability for the self-insured benefits is limited by the purchase of stop-loss insurance. The stop-loss coverage provides payment for aggregate claims exceeding $0.3million per covered person for any given year.
Accruals for losses are made based on our claim experience and actuarial estimates based on historical data. Actual losses may differ from accrued amounts. Should actual losses exceed the amounts expected and if the recorded liabilities are insufficient, an additional expense will be recorded.
Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on investments. This information is provided in our statements of shareholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets at December31, 2011 and 2010 represents accumulated translation adjustments and unrecognized gains and losses on investments classified as available for sale.
Net Income Per Share Net income per share (basic) is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Net income per share (diluted) is calculated by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming any dilutive effects of options and restricted stock units calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of our ClassA common stock results in a greater dilutive effect from outstanding options, stock purchase rights and restricted stock units. Additionally, the exercise of employee stock options and stock purchase rights and the vesting of restricted stock units results in a further dilutive effect on net income per share.

We recorded $16 million in net restructuring costs in 2011, of which $12 million was related to severance and other charges associated with our reduction in workforce across multiple locations and functions, and $4 million was related to the closure of three of our facilities. We currently expect to complete this plan and record additional costs of approximately $1 million in the three months ended March31, 2012.

F-17 Table of Contents Income from the Qualcomm Agreement As part of the Qualcomm Agreement, each party granted certain rights under its patent portfolio to the other party including, in certain circumstances, under future patents issued within one to four years after April26, 2009. The term of the Qualcomm Agreement commenced April26, 2009 and will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of the covered patents. In addition, certain existing patents were assigned by Broadcom to Qualcomm with Broadcom retaining a royalty-free license under these patents. The Qualcomm Agreement also resulted in the parties dismissing with prejudice all outstanding litigation between them, and in Broadcom withdrawing its complaints with foreign competition authorities. Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm is expected to make payments to Broadcom totaling $891million, of which $632million has been paid through December31, 2011. The remaining balance of $259million is expected to be paid in six equal and successive quarterly payments of $43 million each, continuing in the three months ending March31, 2012 and concluding in the three months ending June30, 2013.
We allocated the payment due us under the Qualcomm Agreement amongst several elements. In 2009 we recorded a gain from the settlement of litigation related to intellectual property of $65million, which was recorded as a reduction in settlement costs and approximated the value of the settlements determined by the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
The fair value associated with the transfer of intellectual property rights, as well as the settlement of other outstanding litigation, of $826million, has been accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized within net revenue over the Qualcomm Agreements performance period of four years; recognition is limited to the lesser of the cumulative straight-line amortization over the four year performance period or the cumulative cash proceeds received. As a result, income from the Qualcomm Agreement will never be recorded ahead of cash payments received. We also recognized income from the Qualcomm Agreement of $31million in 2009 related to previous payments made to us by Qualcomm for shipments from May 2007 through December31, 2008, related to a court-ordered permanent injunction. We had deferred the recognition of these amounts, which were received during 2008, due to continuing litigation appeals. These appeals were resolved through the Qualcomm Agreement.
Income from the Qualcomm Agreement is expected to be recognized as follows: 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (In millions) Income from Qualcomm Agreement $ 186 $ 86 $  $ 272 At December31, 2011 we had deferred income of $13million related to the Qualcomm Agreement related to the initial payment by Qualcomm of $200million in April 2009.
Charitable Contributions In April 2009 we established the Broadcom Foundation, or the Foundation, to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs, as well as a broad range of community services. In June 2009 we made an unrestricted grant of $50million to the Foundation upon receiving a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income taxation under Section501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In June 2011 we contributed an additional $25 million to the Foundation. Approximately $2 million of the $25 million contribution came from Dr.Henry Samueli, our Chief Technical Officer and member of the Board of Directors, who made such payment to Broadcom Corporation in connection with the settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation as further described in Note 12. These payments were recorded as operating expenses in consolidated statements of income in 2009 and 2011.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information In 2011 we paid $1 million related to share repurchases that had not settled by December31, 2010. In 2011 we received $4 million related to stock option exercises that had not settled by December31, 2010. In 2010 we received $1million related to stock option exercises that had not settled by December31, 2009.
At December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 we had billings of $43 million, $12million and $8million, respectively, for capital equipment that were accrued. The amounts accrued for capital equipment purchases have been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows and were paid in the subsequent period.

Certain of the cash consideration in the above acquisitions is currently held in escrow pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreements and is reflected in goodwill as we believe the likelihood of the escrow fund being utilized by us is remote.
Our primary reasons for the above acquisitions were to enter into or expand our market share in the relevant wired and wireless communications markets, reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and enhance our technological capabilities. The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill was that the purchase price for each acquisition was based on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology and products with our products, which is of considerably greater value than utilizing each acquired companys technology or product on a standalone basis.
F-19 Table of Contents We allocated the purchase price of these acquisitions to tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of acquisition. Based upon those calculations, the purchase prices for the acquisitions were allocated as follows: 2011 Acquisitions 2010 Acquisitions 2009 Acquisitions (In millions) Fair Market Values Cash and cash equivalents $ 11 $ 26 $ 28 Accounts receivable, net 12 24 5 Inventory 30 27 8 Prepaid and other current assets 4 5 1 Property and equipment, net 3 6 1 Other assets  5  Goodwill 134 336 53 Purchased intangible assets 233 266 136 Total assets acquired 427 695 232 Accounts payable (7 ) (14 ) (2 ) Wages and related benefits (4 ) (8 ) (3 ) Debt  (15 )  Accrued liabilities (2 ) (15 ) (29 ) Long-term liabilities (57 ) (13 )  Total liabilities assumed (70 ) (65 ) (34 ) Purchase price allocation $ 357 $ 630 $ 198 Useful Life 2011 Acquisitions 2010 Acquisitions 2009 Acquisitions (Inyears) (Inmillions) Purchased Intangible Assets: Developed technology 1-13 $ 148 $ 156 $ 58 In-process research and development 2-10 45 55 51 Customer relationships 1-8 37 47 27 Other 1-10 3 8  $ 233 $ 266 $ 136 Purchased Intangible Assets Developed technology represents patented technology and completed technology. Patented technology is the fundamental technology that survives multiple product iterations, while completed technology is specific to certain products acquired: both of these technologies have passed technological feasibility. We generally use a relief-from-royalty method to value patented technology, based on market royalties for similar fundamental technologies. The relief-from-royalty method estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset that would otherwise be payable as royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The royalty rate used is based on an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets. Typically, revenue is projected over the expected remaining useful life of the patented technology. The market-derived royalty rate is then applied to estimate the royalty savings. To value completed technology, we generally use a multi-period excess earnings approach which calculates the value based on the risk-adjusted present value of the cash flows specific to the products, allowing for a reasonable return.
F-20 Table of Contents Customer relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from the sale of products to existing customers of the acquired companies.
In-Process Research and Development The fair value of the IPR&D for our acquisitions was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital, the return on assets, as well as the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. Each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations, the existence and reliance on patented technology, the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility, and the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development. Future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs, taking into account the expected product life cycles, market penetration and growth rates. We believe the amounts recorded as IPR&D, as well as developed technology, represented the fair values and approximate the amounts a market participant would pay for these projects as of the respective acquisition dates.
The following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations of the ongoing development projects that were in process at the date of acquisition and were capitalized as IPR&D in 2011, 2010 and 2009: Company Acquired Development Projects Weighted Average Estimated Percent Complete Average Estimated Time to Complete Estimated Cost to Complete Risk Adjusted Discount Rate IPR&D (In years) (Inmillions) (Inmillions) 2011 Acquisitions Provigent, Inc.

In 2011 and 2010 we reclassified $3 million and $51million, respectively, of IPR&D costs to developed technology, primarily related to our acquisition of Dune Networks, Inc., and such costs will be now be amortized to cost of product revenue. Research and development costs to bring the products of the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Actual results to date have been consistent, in all material respects, with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions.
Contingent Earn-out Consideration In connection with certain of our acquisitions, additional cash consideration of up to $20 million may be paid to former shareholders upon satisfaction of certain future performance goals. In connection with this contingent earn-out consideration, we originally recorded an estimated $1 million liability. In 2011 we recorded a change in contingent earn-out consideration of $1 million and reversed the associated liability. This benefit is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December31, 2011 we do not have any liabilities recorded in connection with any remaining contingent earn-out consideration.
F-21 Table of Contents Supplemental Pro Forma Data (Unaudited) The unaudited pro forma statements of income data below gives effect to the 2011 and 2010 acquisitions, described above, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the year prior to their respective acquisition dates. The following data includes the amortization of purchased intangible assets, the amortization of inventory valuation step-up and stock-based compensation expense. This pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of future operations or of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions taken place in the periods noted above.

The expected purchase consideration is approximately $3.7 billion, net of cash assumed, based on the shares outstanding on September11, 2011.
Under the agreement, each issued and outstanding share of NetLogic common stock (other than (i)shares held by Broadcom, NetLogic or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries and (ii)shares held by NetLogic stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive $50 in cash. The agreement further provides for, subject to certain limited exceptions, (i)the assumption of all in-the-money options to acquire NetLogic common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger held by employees, (ii)the cash-out of all in-the-money stock options held by non-employees, (iii)the conversion of all unvested restricted stock units held by NetLogic employees into Broadcom restricted stock units and (iv)the cash-out of all unvested restricted stock units held by persons other than NetLogic employees.
The transaction has been approved by the Broadcom and NetLogic boards of directors and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of clearance by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce under the Chinese Antimonopoly Law. There are no financing contingencies related to the acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012.

All of our long-term marketable securities had maturities of between one and three years in duration at December31, 2011. Our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities at December31, 2011 consisted of $3.28billion held domestically, with the remaining balance of $1.93billion held by foreign subsidiaries.
At December31, 2011 we had 140 investments that were in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. Our gross unrealized losses of $2 million at December31, 2011 were due to changes in interest rates. We have determined that the gross unrealized losses on these investments at December31, 2011 are temporary in nature. We evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment is evaluated considering numerous factors, and their relative significance varies depending on the situation. Factors considered include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value.

We operate under tax holidays in Singapore, which are effective through March 2014. The tax holidays are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of the Singapore tax holidays decreased Singapore taxes by $368million, $330 million and $225million for 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively.
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. As a result of our recent cumulative tax losses in the U.S.and certain foreign jurisdictions, and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities, we have concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded in such jurisdictions. In certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses, we had net deferred tax liabilities of $62million and $17million at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively.
Our deferred tax assets at December31, 2011 and 2010 do not include $677million and $632million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of our net operating loss carryovers, research and development credits, and capitalized research and development expenses. Shareholders equity will be increased by $677million if and when such excess tax benefits are ultimately realized.
If and when recognized, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December31, 2011 will be accounted for as follows: approximately $1.62billion will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense and $11million will be recorded as an increase in shareholders equity. In 2011 we recorded a $45million increase in foreign net deferred tax liabilities relating to acquisitions.
At December31, 2011 for our income tax filings we had federal, state, United Kingdom, Israel and Spain net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.19billion, $2.05billion, $126 million, $29 million and $12million, respectively. A valuation allowance has been provided on substantially all of these loss carryforwards. If unutilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2019 and 2031, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2012 and 2031, and the Spain net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2021 and 2025. The United Kingdom and Israel net operating losses have no expiration date. At December31, 2011 we had Canada scientific research and experimental development expenditures of $30million available for tax deduction in future tax years. These future tax deductions can be carried forward indefinitely. At December31, 2011, we also had $8million of Israel research and development expenditures which are deductible over the next two tax years. Also, for federal purposes, we had approximately $50million and $2million of charitable and capital loss carryovers, respectively. Charitable contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income and will expire in 2014 if not utilized. Capital losses may only be utilized to offset capital gains and will expire in 2012 if not utilized.
At December31, 2011 for our income tax filings we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $56 million, and federal, state, Canada and Spain research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $691million, $634million, $31 million and $7million, respectively. A valuation allowance has been provided on substantially all of these credit carryforwards. These foreign tax credit carryforwards expire between 2016 and 2021, and these research and development credit carryforwards expire between 2019 and 2031, if not previously utilized. Certain state research and development credit carryforwards have no expiration date.
In 2010, we acquired companies with significant net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards. These attributes are offset with a full valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets at December31, 2010. Internal Revenue Code Sections382 and 383 can limit the amount of net operating losses and credits that can be utilized if certain changes to a companys ownership occur. We determined that there were no material limitations resulting from Internal Revenue Code Sections382 and 383 with respect to these acquired tax attributes.
F-26 Table of Contents At December31, 2011, deferred taxes have not been provided on the excess of book basis over tax basis in the amount of approximately $2.11billion in the shares of certain foreign subsidiaries because their bases differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and are considered permanent in duration. These bases differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of these foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely. The bases differences could reverse through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from the subsidiaries, or various other events. We believe that U.S.income taxes and foreign withholding taxes would be substantially offset upon reversal of this excess book basis due to the existence of domestic net operating loss and credit carryforwards.
The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits: Year Ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 187 $ 401 $ 21 Increases in current year 59 38 7 Expiration of the statutes of limitation for the assessment of taxes (3 ) (3 ) (4 ) Increases (decreases) related to prior year tax positions (31 ) (249 ) 377 Ending balance $ 212 $ 187 $ 401 The unrecognized tax benefits of $212million at December31, 2011 included $36million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. Approximately $2million of the tax benefit, if recognized, would be credited to shareholders equity. The remaining $174million, if recognized, would not result in a tax benefit since it would be fully offset with a valuation allowance. We reversed penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of $4million and $1million, respectively, during 2011, resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitation. We also accrued potential penalties and interest of $2million and $1million, respectively, related to these unrecognized tax benefits during 2011, and in total, as of December31, 2011, we recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $11million and $3million, respectively. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of income as income tax expense.
In 2011 we had an increase in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $59million, primarily relating to transactions with certain foreign subsidiaries. In 2010 we had a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $273million relating to increases to our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized research and development costs, and tax credit carryforwards for previous years primarily resulting from the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit March22, 2010 ruling in the case between Xilinx, Inc. and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and recorded $23million of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from a 2010 change in judgment regarding certain tax accruals. In addition, we had an increase in unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $38million in 2010 primarily relating to transactions with certain foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.
On May27, 2009, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the case between Xilinx, Inc. and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue overturned a 2005 U.S.Tax Court ruling regarding treatment of certain compensation expenses under a Companys research and development cost-sharing arrangements with affiliates. The Court of Appeals originally held that related parties to such an arrangement must share stock-based compensation expenses, notwithstanding the fact that unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not share such costs. As a result of this May27, 2009 decision, we reduced our gross deferred tax assets for federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and capitalized research and development costs, increased our deferred tax assets for certain tax credits, and increased our tax provision in 2009 by approximately $3million. However, on January13, 2010, the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit withdrew its May27, 2009 ruling in the Xilinx case and subsequently issued a new decision in favor of Xilinx on March22, 2010, thereby affirming the August30, 2005 decision of the U.S.Tax Court. Consequently, during the quarter ended March31, 2010, we reversed the amounts we had previously recorded in 2009 related to the courts May27, 2009 decision. As a result, in the quarter ended March31, 2010, we reduced our tax provision by approximately $3million and adjusted certain of our gross deferred tax assets. Included in these adjustments was an increase in our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately F-27 Table of Contents $665million and $455million, respectively, an increase of federal and state capitalized research and development costs of approximately $10million each, an increase in our deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation of approximately $65million, and a decrease in certain tax credits of approximately $10million. These changes in our gross deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance adjustment, and therefore did not result in any change in our net deferred tax assets or our income tax expense for the three months ended March31, 2010. In addition to the adjustments related to the March22, 2010 Xilinx decision, in the three months ended March31, 2010, we reduced our federal and state net operating losses by approximately $60million for adjustments to our intercompany charges to foreign affiliates for the years ended 2001 to 2009. This reduction to our net operating losses was fully offset by a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting in no net change to net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet and no adjustment to our income tax expense.
We file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation. The 2007 through 2011 tax years generally remain open subject to assessment of tax by federal and most state tax authorities. In significant foreign jurisdictions, the 2002 through 2011 tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities. Our income tax returns for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 tax years are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, or (IRS), beginning in the quarter ended December31, 2011. We do not expect that the results of these examinations will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. On June30, 2011 we concluded the IRS examination of our income tax returns for 2004 through 2006, executed a closing agreement covering the 2001 through 2006 tax years, and agreed to certain adjustments for the 2001 through 2006 tax years, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing transactions. Those audit adjustments were offset by federal net operating losses and credits, and did not result in any income tax expense or cash tax liability for the Company. As a result of the IRS examination, taking into account effects on post-audit periods, we reduced our federal and state net operating losses by approximately $620 million and $430 million, respectively, and we reduced amounts relating to federal and state uncertain tax benefits by approximately $180 million and $100 million, respectively, as of June30, 2011. This reduction in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards was fully offset with a reduction in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and had no impact on our operating results or financial position.
In December, 2011 legislation was enacted in Israel which increased tax rates for 2012 and later years. As a result of this legislation, we recorded a $13 million tax provision in 2011 for the effect of this tax rate increase on our Israel net deferred tax liabilities, which were principally related to purchased intangible assets. In December, 2010 the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 was enacted. A provision in this legislation provided for the extension of the research and development tax credit for qualifying expenditures paid or incurred from January1, 2010 through December31, 2011. As a result of this new legislation, we generated federal research and development tax credits of $118 million and $145million for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These tax credits, if unutilized, will carry forward to future periods. No tax benefit was recorded for these carryovers since we have a full valuation allowance on our U.S.deferred tax assets.
6.Long-Term Debt Senior Notes The following table presents details of our long-term debt liabilities: December31, 2011 2010 (In millions) 1.500% fixed-rate notes, due 2013 $ 300 $ 300 2.375% fixed-rate notes, due 2015 400 400 2.700% fixed-rate notes, due 2018 500  1,200 $ 700 Unaccreted discount (4 ) (3 ) $ 1,196 $ 697 F-28 Table of Contents In November 2010 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $700million. These notes consist of $300million aggregate principal amount which mature in November 2013, or the 2013 Notes, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.500%per annum, and $400million aggregate principal amount which mature in November 2015, or the 2015 Notes, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.375%per annum. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on May1 and November1 of each year, beginning on May1, 2011. The 2013 Notes were issued at an effective yield of 1.605% and an original issue discount at 99.694% and the 2015 Notes were issued at an effective yield of 2.494% and an original issue discount at 99.444%.
In September 2011 we entered into and completed an exchange offer registration statement to issue registered notes with substantially identical terms as the original 2013 and 2015 Notes. Nearly all of the original notes were exchanged. The exchange offer was made in order to satisfy certain obligations of Broadcom contained in a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November1, 2010.
In November 2011 we issued senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amount of $500 million which mature in November 2018 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.700%per annum, or the 2018 Notes. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on May1 and November1 of each year, beginning on May1, 2012. The 2018 Notes were issued at an effective yield of 2.762% and an original issue discount at 99.609%.
The 2018 Notes are subject to a mandatory redemption in the event Broadcoms proposed acquisition of NetLogic is not consummated on or prior to August31, 2012, or if prior to August31 2012, the Agreement and Plan of Merger is terminated. In such an event, the 2018 Notes will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principle amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
We may redeem the 2013 Notes, the 2015 Notes or 2018 Notes, or the Notes at any time, subject to a specified make-whole premium as defined in the indenture governing the respective Notes. In the event of a change of control triggering event, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Default can be triggered by any missed interest or principal payment, breach of covenant, or in certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.
The Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to grant liens on assets; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; or merge, consolidate or sell assets. Failure to comply with these covenants, or any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes.
These Notes are recorded as long-term debt, net of original issue discount. The discount and debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the Notes are amortized to interest expense over their respective terms. The effective rates for the fixed-rate debt include the interest on the notes and the accretion of the original issue discount. Based on the market prices, the fair value of our Notes was $1.22 billion and $687 million as of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively.
Relative to our overall indebtedness, the Notes rank in right of payment (i)equal with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness (ii)senior to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness, and (iii)effectively subordinated to all of our subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness and other obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness and other obligations, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness and other obligations.
Credit Facility In November 2010 we entered into a credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $500million. We amended this credit facility in October 2011 primarily to extend the maturity date by two years to November19, 2016, at which time all outstanding revolving facility loans (if any) and accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid.
F-29 Table of Contents The amendment to the credit facility also decreased the interest rate margins applicable to loans made under the credit facility and the commitment fee paid on the amount of the unused commitments. We did not draw on our credit facility in 2011 or 2010.
Any advances under a Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan will accrue interest at the British Bankers Association LIBOR, or BBA LIBOR, plus the Applicable Rate. Any advances under a USDollar Base Rate Committed Loan will accrue interest at rates that are equal to the Applicable Rate plus the higher of (a)the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b)Bank of Americas prime rate as announced from time to time, or (c)BBA LIBOR plus 1.0%. The Applicable Rate is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard& Poors Rating Services and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and can range between 0.625% and 1.500% for Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans and 0.000% to 0.500% for US Dollar Base Rate Committed Loans. We are also required to pay a commitment fee on the actual daily unused amount of commitments. We may also, upon the agreement of the existing lenders, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $100million. Borrowings of swing line loans bear interest at a rate equivalent to the US Dollar Base Rate Committed Loans noted above.
The credit facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. Financial covenants require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00.
7.Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our commitments and other contractual obligations as of December31, 2011: Payment Obligations by Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In millions) Operating leases $ 121 $ 120 $ 90 $ 76 $ 69 $ 123 $ 599 Inventory and related purchase obligations 468      468 Other obligations 147 35 31 30 23 3 269 Long-term debt and related interest 27 328 23 423 13 527 1,341 $ 763 $ 483 $ 144 $ 529 $ 105 $ 653 $ 2,677 Facilities rent expense in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $84 million, $71million and $70million, respectively.
Inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services. We depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services. Due to lengthy subcontractor lead times, we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the ensuing six months. Our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders, but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation.
Other obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment, computer hardware, information systems infrastructure, mask and prototyping costs, intellectual property licensing arrangements and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business.
For purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon. We have additional purchase orders (not included in the table above) that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.
F-30 Table of Contents 8.Shareholders Equity Common Stock At December31, 2011 we had 2.5 billion authorized shares of ClassA common stock and 400million authorized shares of ClassB common stock. The shares of ClassA common stock and ClassB common stock are substantially identical, except that holders of ClassA common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, and holders of ClassB common stock are entitled to ten votes for each share held, on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders. In addition, holders of ClassB common stock are entitled to vote separately on the proposed issuance of additional shares of ClassB common stock in certain circumstances. The shares of ClassB common stock are not publicly traded. Each share of ClassB common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of ClassA common stock and in most instances automatically converts upon sale or other transfer. The ClassA common stock and ClassB common stock are sometimes collectively referred to herein as common stock. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, 1million, 3million and 6million shares, respectively, of ClassB common stock were automatically converted into a like number of shares of ClassA common stock upon sale or other transfer pursuant to the terms of our Articles of Incorporation.
Share Repurchase Programs From time to time our Board of Directors has authorized various programs to repurchase shares of our ClassA common stock depending on market conditions and other factors. In February 2010 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized an evergreen share repurchase program intended to offset dilution of incremental grants of stock awards associated with our stock incentive plans. The maximum number of shares of our ClassA common stock that may be repurchased in any one year (including under an ASR or other arrangement) is equal to the total number of shares issued pursuant to our equity awards in the previous year and the current year. Our February 2010 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended at any time at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
In February 2011 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement to repurchase $300 million of our ClassA common stock, which was recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity. Under the ASR program we received and cancelled 7million shares of our ClassA common stock with a weighted average price of $42.64 per share.
In addition to the shares repurchased under the ASR in February 2011, we repurchased 10million shares of our ClassA common stock at a weighted average price of $36.84 per share in 2011. We repurchased 9million and 15million shares of our ClassA common stock at a weighted average prices of $30.86 and $28.12 per share in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Repurchases under our share repurchase programs were and are intended to be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
Quarterly Dividend In January 2010 our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08per common share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of 2010. In January 2011 our Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the existing dividend policy pursuant to which we increased the quarterly cash dividends by 12.5% to $0.09 per common share ($0.36 per share on an annual basis) and declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of 2011. In 2011 and 2010 we paid $194 million and $163million, respectively, in dividends to holders of our ClassA and ClassB common stock. These dividends were paid from U.S.domestic sources other than our retained earnings and are accounted for as reductions of shareholders equity.
F-31 Table of Contents Registration Statements Wehave aForm S-3 universal shelf registration statement and a Form S-4acquisition shelf registration statement onfile with the SEC. The universal shelf registration statement on FormS-3 permits Broadcom to sell, in one or more public offerings, shares of our ClassA common stock, shares of preferred stock or debt securities, or any combination of such securities, for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $1.5billion. The 2018 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million that weissued in November 2011 (more fully described in Note 6) were issued pursuant tothe Form S-3.The Form S-3 will expire in accordance with applicable SEC rules on February27, 2012. The acquisition shelf registration statement on FormS-4 enables us to issue up to 30million shares of our ClassA common stock in one or more acquisition transactions. These transactions may include the acquisition of assets, businesses or securities by any form of business combination. To date no securities have been issued pursuant to the S-4 registration statement, which does not have an expiration date mandated by SEC rules.
9.Employee Benefit Plans Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, for all eligible employees. Under the ESPP, employees may purchase shares of our ClassA common stock at six-month intervals at 85% of fair market value (calculated in the manner provided in the plan). Employees purchase such stock using payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of their total cash compensation. Shares of ClassA common stock are offered under the ESPP through a series of successive offering periods, generally with a maximum duration of 24months, subject to an additional 3-month extension under certain circumstances. The plan imposes certain limitations upon an employees right to acquire ClassA common stock, including the following: (i)no employee may purchase more than 9,000shares of ClassA common stock on any one purchase date, (ii)no employee may be granted rights to purchase more than $25,000 worth of ClassA common stock for each calendar year that such rights are at any time outstanding, and (iii)the maximum number of shares of ClassA common stock purchasable in total by all participants in the ESPP on any purchase date is limited to 4million shares. The number of shares of ClassA common stock reserved for issuance under the plan automatically increases in January each year. The increase is equal to a percentage of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last trading day of the immediately preceding year, subject to an annual share limit.
In 2011, 2010 and 2009, 4million, 6million and 6million shares, respectively, were issued under this plan at average per share prices of $29.93, $15.21 and $14.59, respectively. At December31, 2011, 14million shares were available for future issuance under this plan.
Stock Incentive Plans We have in effect stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Our 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, or 1998 Plan, is the successor equity incentive program to our 1994 Stock Option Plan, or 1994 Plan and our 1998 Special Stock Option Plan, together, the Predecessor Plans. The number of shares of ClassA common stock reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan automatically increases in January each year. The increase is equal to 4.5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last trading day of the immediately preceding year, subject to an annual share limit.
The Board of Directors or the Plan Administrator determines eligibility, vesting schedules and exercise prices for options granted under the plans. Options granted generally have a term of 10years, and in the case of new hires generally vest and become exercisable at the rate of 25% after one year and ratably on a monthly basis over a period of 36months thereafter; subsequent option grants to existing employees generally vest and become exercisable ratably on a monthly basis over a period of 48months measured from the date of grant. However, certain options that have been granted under our 1998 Plan or that were assumed by us in connection with certain of our acquisitions provide that the vesting of the options granted thereunder will accelerate in whole or in part upon the occurrence of certain specified events.
F-32 Table of Contents In addition, we grant restricted stock units to certain employees as part of our regular annual employee equity compensation review program as well as to selected new hires and to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Restricted stock units are share awards that entitle the holder to receive freely tradable shares of our ClassA common stock upon vesting. Generally, restricted stock units vest ratably on a quarterly basis over 16 quarters from the date of grant. On a limited basis, we grant certain restricted stock units that vest in their entirety after three years.
In January 2011 the Compensation Committee adopted a Performance Restricted Stock Units Incentive Award Program, or the PRSU Program. In 2011 we granted 0.2 million PRSUs that were based on 2010 performance targets under the PRSU Program. Under the terms of the PRSU Program, the award recipients were also awarded grants of the same number of PRSUs to be made in the subsequent two calendar years on the basis of having met the 2010 performance targets.
In connection with certain acquisitions, we have assumed stock options granted under stock option plans or agreements established by the acquired company. As of December31, 2011, 1million shares of ClassA commonstock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options assumed under these stock option plans.
Combined Incentive Plan Activity Activity under all stock option incentive plans is set forth below: Options Outstanding Number of Shares Exercise PriceRange perShare Weighted Average Exercise Price perShare Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share (Inmillions) Balance at December31, 2008 122 $ .01-81.50 $ 25.42 $ 15.66 Options granted under the 1998 Plan 3 17.83-29.07 23.26 10.91 Options cancelled (4 ) .01-48.63 31.12 15.71 Options exercised (8 ) .01-31.08 17.93 13.23 Balance at December31, 2009 113 .01-81.50 25.71 15.71 Options granted under the 1998 Plan 3 29.39-42.34 29.64 9.43 Options issued in connection with acquisitions 1 0.55 - 41.57 14.26 25.76 Options cancelled (1 ) .01 - 81.50 36.47 15.24 Options exercised (38 ) .01 - 44.99 22.56 16.88 Balance at December31, 2010 78 .01 - 48.63 27.05 15.05 Options granted under the 1998 Plan  45.82 45.82 11.72 Options cancelled (2 ) 0.55 - 48.63 30.08 11.87 Options exercised (10 ) .01 - 45.05 23.48 15.86 Balance at December31, 2011 66 $ .01 - 48.63 $ 27.47 $ 15.10 At December31, 2011 outstanding options to purchase 63million shares were exercisable with an average per share exercise price of $27.57. The weighted average remaining contractual lives of options outstanding and of options exercisable as of December31, 2011 were 3.7years and 3.6years, respectively.
The total pretax intrinsic value of options exercised in 2011 was $163million. This intrinsic value represents the difference between the fair market value of our ClassA common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option. Based on the closing price of our ClassA common stock of $29.36 on December31, 2011, the total pretax intrinsic value of all outstanding options was $300million. The total pretax intrinsic value of exercisable options at December31, 2011 was $286million.
F-33 Table of Contents Restricted stock unit activity is set forth below: RestrictedStock Units Outstanding Numberof Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value perShare (Inmillions) Balance at December31, 2008 28 $ 27.61 Restricted stock units granted 14 24.06 Restricted stock units cancelled (2 ) 24.51 Restricted stock units vested (11 ) 28.84 Balance at December31, 2009 29 25.58 Restricted stock units granted 13 30.91 Restricted stock units cancelled (1 ) 26.04 Restricted stock units vested (13 ) 27.44 Balance at December31, 2010 28 27.17 Restricted stock units granted 10 42.45 Restricted stock units cancelled (2 ) 31.63 Restricted stock units vested (14 ) 28.84 Balance at December31, 2011 22 $ 32.88 The total pretax intrinsic value of restricted stock units that vested in 2011 was $397million. Based on the closing price of our ClassA common stock of $29.36 on December31, 2011, the total pretax intrinsic value of all outstanding restricted stock units was $659million.
The per share fair values of stock options granted in connection with stock incentive plans and rights granted in connection with the employee stock purchase plan have been estimated with the following weighted average assumptions: EmployeeStockOptions EmployeeStockPurchaseRights 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Expected life (in years) 3.60 4.08 4.98 1.70 1.23 0.92 Implied volatility 0.34 0.39 0.53 0.37 0.39 0.53 Risk-free interest rate 1.56 % 1.61 % 1.83 % 0.50 % 0.25 % 0.46 % Expected dividend yield 0.80 % 1.00 % 0.00 % 0.99 % 0.76 % 0.00 % Weighted average fair value $ 11.72 $ 13.47 $ 10.91 $ 11.01 $ 11.83 $ 7.39 Stock-Based Compensation Expense The following table presents details of total stock-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item on our consolidated statements of income: YearEndedDecember31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Cost of product revenue $ 24 $ 23 $ 25 Research and development 364 341 352 Selling, general and administrative 126 119 120 $ 514 $ 483 $ 497 F-34 Table of Contents The following table presents details of unearned stock-based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in 2012 through 2015 related to unvested share-based payment awards at December31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total (In millions) Unearned stock-based compensation $ 357 $ 228 $ 119 $ 21 $ 725 The weighted-average period over which the unearned stock-based compensation is expected to be recognized is 1.3years.
If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. Future stock-based compensation expense and unearned stock-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.
SharesReserved For Future Issuance We had the following shares of common stock reserved for future issuance upon the exercise or issuance of equity instruments: NumberofShares (In millions) Stock options outstanding 66 Authorized for future grants under stock incentive plans 112 Authorized for future issuance under stock purchase plan 14 Restricted stock units outstanding 22 Balance at December31, 2011 214 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan We sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) savings and investment plan, established in 1996, covering substantially all of our U.S.employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements. At our discretion, we may make contributions to this plan. We have a limited matching contribution policy under which we made $14 million, $11million and $7million in contributions to participants in this plan in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
10.Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets In 2011 we made a qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment exists. Since we did not determine that it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we were not required to perform the current two-step goodwill impairment test. At December31, 2011 the book value of the Company was $6.52 billion while the market capitalization was $15.99 billion. We performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill in October 2010 and 2009. We compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units that existed at those times to its estimated fair value.
We estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method, taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as a validation of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered perpetual earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies. Future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating appropriate present value techniques.
F-35 Table of Contents Specifically, the income approach valuations included the following assumptions for 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Discount Rate 12.0%-17.7 % 12.0%-17.5 % Perpetual Growth Rate 4.0 % 4.0 % Tax 17.0 % 17.0 % Risk Free Rate 3.4 % 4.0 % Peer Company Beta 1.26-1.52 1.24-1.69 Upon completion of the October 2011, 2010 and 2009 annual impairment assessments, we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value.
In 2011 we recorded a purchased intangible impairments charge of $74 million related to our acquisition of Beceem. The primary factor contributing to this impairment charge was a reduction in the forecasted cash flows related to WiMAX products, as wireless service providers have accelerated their adoption of competing Long Term Evolution, or LTE, products. In addition we recorded other impairment charges of $18 million in 2011.
In 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of $19million, primarily related to a technology license that was acquired in 2008 from Sunext Design, Inc. In 2009 we recorded impairment charges to customer relationships, developed technology and certain other assets of $19million related to the acquisition of the DTV Business of AMD in 2008. The primary factor contributing to these impairment charges was the continued reduction in our revenue outlook for these businesses, and the related decrease to the estimated cash flows identified with the impaired assets.
In determining the amount of these impairment charges we calculated fair values as of the impairment date for acquired developed technology, IPR&D and customer relationships. The fair value for the first two assets was determined using the multiple period excess earnings method, which method is described above in Note 3. The fair value of acquired customer relationships was based on the benefit derived from the incremental revenue and related cash flow as a direct result of the customer relationship. The fair values were determined using significant unobservable inputs categorized as Level 3 inputs.
11.Settlement Costs (Gains), Net In 2011 we recorded settlement gains of $55 million primarily related to the settlement of the federal consolidated shareholder derivative action, or the Derivative Settlement, partially offset by net settlement costs of $37 million related to patent infringement claims, resulting in net settlement gains of $18 million. In 2010 we recorded settlement costs of $53million primarily related to licensing and settlement agreements and certain employment tax items. In 2009 we incurred settlement costs of $184million, partially offset by settlement gains of $66million, resulting in $118million of net settlement costs.
On March18, 2011 Broadcom announced that the remaining defendants in the federal consolidated shareholder derivative action relating to the companys historical stock option accounting practices entered into a settlement. On May23, 2011, the District Court entered an order granting final approval of the Derivative Settlement. Pursuant to the Derivative Settlement: - Broadcom received a payment from Henry T. Nicholas, III, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and former Co-Chairman of the Board, of approximately $27 million; - Broadcom cancelled unexercised Broadcom stock options held by Dr.Henry Samueli, our Chief Technical Officer and member of our Board of Directors, valued at approximately $14 million, using a Black-Scholes analysis based on the closing price of Broadcoms ClassA common stock on the date the settlement was deemed final (such stock options were originally valued at $24 million for purposes of the settlement (using the same methodology used to value equity granted to employees in the February annual focal compensation review)); and - Dr.Samueli contributed approximately $2 million in cash to the Broadcom Foundation (through Broadcom Corporation).
F-36 Table of Contents We entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement of the Stock Option ClassActions dated as of April30, 2010, which provides for the claims against Broadcom and its current and former officers and directors to be dismissed with prejudice and released in exchange for a $161million cash payment by Broadcom. We recorded the settlement amount as a one-time charge in our statement of income for the three months and year ended December31, 2009 and subsequent payment was made in June 2010 into a settlement fund.
We recorded settlement gains of $65 million related to the Qualcomm Agreement in 2009. For a further discussion of this agreement, see Note2. In addition, we recorded settlement costs of $12 million related to a payment to the Israeli government associated with a post-acquisition technology transfer fee related to our acquisition of Dune Networks. We also recorded $11million in settlement costs in 2009 for estimated settlements associated with certain employment tax items, other employment matters and a patent infringement claim.
For further discussion of litigation matters, see Note 12.
12.Litigation We and certain of our subsidiaries are currently parties to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. Unless otherwise noted below, during the period presented we have not: recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with such legal proceedings; determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible; or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable. We are engaged in numerous other legal actions not described below arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.
From time to time we may conclude it is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and customers to settle one or more litigation matters, and any such settlement could include substantial payments; however, other than as noted below, we have not reached this conclusion with respect to any particular matter at this time. There are a variety of factors that influence our decisions to settle and the amount we may choose to pay, including the strength of our case, developments in the litigation, the behavior of other interested parties, the demand on management time and the possible distraction of our employees associated with the case and/or the possibility that we may be subject to an injunction or other equitable remedy. It is difficult to predict whether a settlement is possible, the amount of an appropriate settlement or when is the opportune time to settle a matter in light of the numerous factors that go into the settlement decision.
Intellectual Property Proceedings In September 2009 we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Emulex Corporation, or Emulex, alleging infringement of ten patents generally relating to networking technologies. In subsequent filings, we added two additional patents and withdrew six patents, bringing the total to six asserted patents. In its answers, Emulex denied liability and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the asserted patents are invalid and not infringed. A trial occurred in September and October 2011, and the Court heard post-trial motions in December 2011.
The Court has found that all six asserted Broadcom patents are not invalid. The Court further found Emulex infringed U.S. Patent No.7,058,150 and 7,471,691. On January6, 2012, we filed a motion for injunctive relief on the 150 and 691 patents, which motion is scheduled to be heard in March 2012. On the remaining four patents, the jury found one patent not infringed and failed to reach a verdict on the other three, resulting in a mistrial on those three patents. The Court has not yet scheduled a new trial on the three patents.
In November 2009 we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or CSIRO, seeking a declaratory judgment that a certain U.S. patent number is invalid, unenforceable and not infringed. CSIRO has answered the complaint and counterclaimed for infringement against Broadcom wireless LAN products and seeking damages, attorneys fees, and an injunction. In connection with an ex parte reexamination, the Patent Office has issued a Reexamination Certificate allowing the original claims of CSIROs patent and adding some amended claims. However, the Patent Office subsequently initiated a reexamination and rejected all effective claims of the patent-in-suit, including the amended claims. Trial has been set for April 2012.
F-37 Table of Contents In August 2010, Broadcom filed a motion to intervene (i.e., to be added as a party) in U.S. Ethernet Innovations, LLC v. Acer, Inc.
, Case No.10-cv-03724-JW (N.D. Cal.). In this case, U.S. Ethernet Innovations, LLC, or USEI, filed a patent infringement complaint alleging that numerous companies, including certain Broadcom customers, infringe four patents relating generally to Ethernet technology. USEI seeks monetary damages, attorneys fees, and an injunction. Defendants have filed answers denying the allegations in USEIs complaint and asserting counterclaims for declaratory judgment that USEIs patents are invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed. Broadcom contends that it has a license related to USEIs patents and is seeking to assert this license as a defense. In December 2010, the Court granted Broadcoms motion to intervene. A claims construction hearing was held on October21, 2011, and no trial date has been set.
Since December 2006 Broadcom and its subsidiary, Global Locate, Inc., were engaged in various litigation matters with SiRF Technology, Inc., which company was later acquired by CSR plc. On January10, 2011, Broadcom and CSR announced that the parties had settled all outstanding litigation between themselves and their subsidiaries. The consideration received and to be received under the agreement was allocated on a relative fair value basis between a settlement gain and patent licensing royalty revenue. Revenue derived from the patent license will be recognized as licensing revenue.
Since December 2010, Broadcom was engaged in litigation with Rambus, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States International Trade Commission. In the district court, Rambus alleged that certain Broadcom products infringe nineteen patents relating generally to memory controller and high speed interface technologies. In the International Trade Commission Rambus asserted that Broadcom engaged in unfair trade practices by importing certain memory controllers and devices having certain accused interface technologies that allegedly infringe six patents. On December22, 2011 the parties settled all outstanding litigation, and signed a five year patent license, whereby we were required to pay certain amounts for alleged prior infringement and the licensing of intellectual property. On December29, 2011, the United States District Court entered a dismissal of the litigation between Rambus and Broadcom. Also on December29, 2011, Rambus and Broadcom filed a joint motion to terminate the International Trade Commission investigation as to Broadcom, which was granted by the Administrative Law Judge on January 17, 2012, and is currently pending with the Commission. The settlement was treated as a multiple element arrangement and the consideration was allocated to alleged prior infringement and licensing of intellectual property for future use. The consideration allocated to alleged prior infringement was recognized as a settlement cost in our consolidated statement of income in 2011.
We and our subsidiaries are also involved in other intellectual property proceedings, claims and litigation. We will disclose the nature of any such matter if we believe it to be material. Particularly in the early stages of such proceedings, an assessment of materiality may be complicated by limited information, including, without limitation, limited information about the patents-in-suit and Broadcom products against which the patents are being asserted. Accordingly, our assessment of materiality may change in the future based upon availability of discovery and further developments in the proceedings at issue. Some of these intellectual property proceedings may involve, for example, non-practicing entities asserting claims addressing certain of our products. The resolution of intellectual property litigation can include, among other things, payment of damages, royalties, or other amounts, which could adversely, impact our product gross margins in future periods, or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees may perform for us. In addition, from time to time we are approached by holders of intellectual property, including non-practicing entities, to engage in discussions about our obtaining licenses to their intellectual property. We will disclose the nature of any such discussion if we determine that (i)it is probable an intellectual property holder will assert a claim of infringement, (ii)there is a reasonable possibility the outcome (assuming assertion) will be unfavorable, and (iii)the resulting liability would be material to our financial condition.
Other Litigation In November 2009 Emulex filed a complaint in the Central District of California against Broadcom alleging violation of the antitrust laws, defamation, and unfair competition. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees. In January 2010, Emulex filed an amended complaint in which Emulex removed, among other things, the claim of unfair competition. In February 2010, we F-38 Table of Contents filed motions to dismiss the case and a motion to strike. In June 2010, the District Court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss and denied our motion to strike. In July 2010, we filed a notice of appeal of the District Courts denial of our motion to strike. In November 2010, the parties agreed to a voluntary stay of the appeal. Trial has been scheduled for January 2013.
In April 2011 Motorola Mobility, Inc., or MMI, filed a third-party complaint against Broadcom in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that we breached a duty to defend, indemnify, and hold MMI harmless for certain patent infringement claims that MMI is defending. In the same action, MMI is defending itself against claims for patent infringement brought by Biax Corporation involving certain U.S. patents. In December 2011 we entered into a settlement agreement with MMI, pursuant to which MMI filed a motion to dismiss its claims against Broadcom without prejudice. On January6, 2012 the Court granted MMIs motion to dismiss.
As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2010, in 2006 a number of purported Broadcom shareholders filed putative shareholder derivative actions in state and federal court against Broadcom, each of the then members of our Board of Directors and certain current or former officers, alleging, among other things, that the defendants improperly dated certain Broadcom employee stock option grants. In August 2009 Broadcom plaintiffs and certain defendants executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Partial Settlement in the federal derivative action, which resolved all claims except those against three individuals: Dr.HenryT. Nicholas, III, our former President and Chief Executive Officer and former Co-Chairman of the Board, William J. Ruehle, our former Chief Financial Officer, and Dr.Henry Samueli, our Chief Technical Officer and member of our Board of Directors.
In March 2011, Broadcom, plaintiffs and the three remaining defendants executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, or Derivative Settlement, in the federal derivative action. On May23, 2011, the District Court entered an order granting final approval of the Derivative Settlement. Pursuant to the Derivative Settlement, among other things: (i)Broadcom received a payment from Dr.Nicholas of approximately $27 million, which was recorded as a settlement gain in our consolidated statements of income; (ii)Broadcom cancelled unexercised Broadcom stock options held by Dr.Samueli valued at approximately $14 million, using a Black-Scholes analysis based on the closing price of Broadcoms ClassA common stock on the date the settlement was deemed final, which amount was recorded as a settlement gain in our consolidated statements of income; (iii)Dr.Samueli contributed approximately $2 million in cash to the Broadcom Foundation (through Broadcom Corporation), which was recorded as a settlement gain in our consolidated statements of income; (iv)Mr.Ruehle executed and filed a Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice of an action filed by him against Broadcom , which sought damages in excess of $26 million; and (v)Dr.Nicholas, Mr.Ruehle and Dr.Samueli were dismissed with prejudice from the federal consolidated shareholder derivative litigation.
Upon Court approval of the Derivative Settlement, Broadcom paid plaintiffs counsel $25 million of the settlement proceeds for attorneys fees, expenses, and costs, which was recorded as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of income. In addition, Broadcom contributed approximately $25 million to the Broadcom Foundation (which included the $2 million payment from Dr.Samueli discussed above). Such amount was recorded as a charitable contribution in the consolidated statements of income. On July1, 2011, the plaintiffs in the state derivative action filed a request for dismissal with prejudice of that action. The Court entered an order dismissing the state derivative action on July8, 2011.
In April 2008 we delivered a Notice of Arbitration and Arbitration Claim to our former independent registered public accounting firm Ernst& Young LLP, or E&Y, and certain related parties. The arbitration relates to the issues that led to the restatement of Broadcoms financial statements for the periods from 1998 through March31, 2006 as disclosed in an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December31, 2005 and an amended Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the three months ended March31, 2006, each filed with the SEC January23, 2007. In May 2008 E&Y delivered a Notice of Defense and Counterclaim. The arbitration hearing has been scheduled for October 2012.
In September 2011, two lawsuits were filed by stockholders of NetLogic Microsystems Inc. purporting to assert claims arising from Broadcoms entry into a definitive merger agreement with NetLogic under which a subsidiary of Broadcom, I&N Acquisition Corp., will be merged with and into NetLogic. On November11, 2011, all parties to F-39 Table of Contents these actions, captioned New Jersey Carpenters Pension Fund v. Broyles et al., (Cal. Super. Ct. County of Santa Clara, Case No.1-11-CV-209381) (referred to as the California Action), and Danielo v. NetLogic Microsystems, et al., (Del. Ct. of Chancery, Case No.6881-VCG) (referred to as the Delaware Action), executed a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, respecting a proposed settlement of the claims in each of those actions.The terms of the proposed settlement required NetLogic to make certain supplemental disclosures regarding the Merger in a Form 8-Kfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission by NetLogic on November14, 2011, and contemplatethe payment by NetLogicof attorneys fees and costs to counsel representing the plaintiffs in the amount of $795,000, or such lower amount as the Court may order.The terms of the MOU also provide for a general stay of proceedings in both actions, excluding proceedings related to finalizing and seeking court approval of theproposed settlement and any necessary confirmatory discovery.The parties in the California Action are currently negotiating the terms of a Stipulation of Settlement to present to the Court for preliminary approval. Under the terms of the MOU and the stipulation, the Delaware Action will be voluntarily dismissed with prejudice upon the Courts final approval of the stipulation in the California Action.
General We and our subsidiaries are also involved in other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We will disclose the nature of any such matter if we believe it to be material.
The pending proceedings described above involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. The results of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are possible. From time to time we may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of pending intellectual property or other litigation or other proceedings; however, there can be no assurance that any such discussions will occur or will result in a settlement. In the course of such settlement discussions, if we conclude that a settlement is probable and the settlement amount is estimable we may record settlement costs, notwithstanding not having reached a final settlement agreement. In the three months ended September30, 2011 and December31, 2011 we recorded net settlement costs of $27 million and $5 million, respectively, related to the actual and potential settlements of patent infringement claims referenced above. Upon the occurrence of certain events, we may be required to record additional settlement costs of up to $20 million. The settlement of any pending litigation or other proceeding could require us to incur substantial settlement payments and costs. Furthermore, the settlement of any intellectual property proceeding may require us to grant a license to certain of our intellectual property rights to the other party under a cross-license agreement. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. See Note 11 for an additional breakout of our settlement costs (gains).
13.Business Enterprise Segments, Significant Customer, Supplier and Geographical Information Business Enterprise Segments Broadcom has three reportable segments consistent with our target markets. Our three reportable segments are: Broadband Communications (Home), Mobile& Wireless (Hand) and Infrastructure& Networking (Infrastructure). Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information at the reporting segment level. In January 2011, our Mobile Platforms and Wireless Connectivity businesses were combined for internal reporting purposes, which aligns with our externally reported Mobile& Wireless segment.
We also report an All Other category that primarily includes licensing revenue from our agreement with Verizon Wireless and income from the Qualcomm Agreement since they are principally the result of corporate efforts. All Other also includes operating expenses that we do not allocate to our other operating segments as these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by our CODM. Operating costs and expenses that are not allocated include stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, net settlement costs, net restructuring costs, charitable contributions, employer payroll tax on certain stock option exercises, and other miscellaneous expenses related to corporate allocations that were either over or under the original projections at the beginning of the year. We include stock-based compensation and acquisition-related items in the All Other category as decisions regarding equity F-40 Table of Contents compensation are made at the corporate level and our CODM reviews reportable segment performance exclusive of these charges. In 2010, we reclassified the amortization of acquired inventory valuation step-up from its respective reportable segment into the All Other category, as these charges are the result of acquisition accounting and we believe these amounts should not be included when measuring our reportable segments operating performance. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Four independent third-party foundries located in Asia manufacture a majority of our semiconductor devices in current production. Any sudden demand for an increased amount of semiconductor devices or sudden reduction or elimination of any existing source or sources of semiconductor devices could result in a material delay in the shipment of our products. In addition, substantially all of our products are assembled and tested by one of six independent third-party subcontractors in Asia. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these suppliers. Any problems associated with the fabrication facilities or the delivery, quality or cost of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have an international distribution center that includes engineering design and administrative facilities in Singapore as well as engineering design facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Greece, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. At December31, 2011, $105million, or approximately 25.8%, of our tangible long-lived assets were located outside the United States.
