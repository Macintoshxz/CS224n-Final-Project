Overview Alcoa is the worlds leading producer of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina, and is active in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent approximately two-thirds of Alcoas revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include precision castings, 3 Table of Contents industrial fasteners, vinyl siding, consumer products, food service and flexible packaging products, plastic closures and electrical distribution systems for cars and trucks. Alcoas products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, consumer products, building and construction, and industrial applications.
Alcoas operations consist of five worldwide segments: Alumina and Chemicals, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, Engineered Products, and Packaging and Consumer. Alcoa businesses that are not reported to management as part of one of these five segments are combined and reported as Other.
The Alumina and Chemicals segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Generally, Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited (formerly WMC Limited) owns 40% of these entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos.10(a) through 10(e) to this report.
Alcoa Aluminio S.A. (Aluminio), an integrated aluminum producer in Brazil, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa. Aluminio operates mining, refining, smelting and fabricated products facilities at various locations in Brazil. In August 2003, Alcoa acquired the 40.9% shareholding in Aluminio held by affiliates of Camargo Correa S.A. (collectively the Camargo Group). Prior to the acquisition, Alcoa had owned approximately 59% of Aluminio and the Camargo Group had been the principal minority shareholder since 1984. For more information on this acquisition, see Note F to the financial statements.
Recent Developments In January 2005, Alcoa completed its acquisition of RUSALs controlling interests in two fabricating facilities in Samara and Belaya Kalitva in the Russian Federation for $257 million in cash.
In early January 2005, the company and BHP Billiton announced that they had completed the sale of their respective equity interests in Integris Metals, Inc., a metals service center company engaged in the processing and distribution of metals, to Ryerson Tull for $410 million in cash plus assumption of debt, which was approximately $234 million. Alcoa and BHP Billiton each owned 50% of Integris Metals.
In December 2004, Alcoa signed a letter of intent with Fujikura Ltd. of Japan in which Alcoa will obtain complete ownership of the Alcoa Fujikura Ltd. (AFL) automotive business based in Detroit, MI, and Fujikura will obtain complete ownership of the AFL telecommunications business, based in Nashville, TN. Alcoa and Fujikura currently hold a 51-49% respective ownership of both through the AFL joint venture. The transaction, expected to be implemented through a share exchange by Fujikura of all of its AFL shares for all shares in a new telecommunications subsidiary, including cash, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2005.
Also in December 2004, the company announced that it had sold a portion of its interest in the Juruti (Brazil) bauxite project to AWAC. In exchange for Alcoas interest in the Juruti project, Alumina Limited, Alcoas partner in AWAC, contributed $40 million to AWAC.
In October 2004, Alcoa announced a reorganization of its management structure to better align itself with global markets. Alcoa created a new global primary business to serve the aluminum and alumina markets, and a new global extruded products business. It also created an integrated North American & European business to serve the mill products markets. The rigid packaging business, with major operations in the U.S. and Australia, will be organized into a new global business group, and combined with Alcoas Asia operations and the global industrial foil business. These four new businesses, along with two existing global businesses serving the packaging and transportation markets, will give Alcoa a more simplified structure better suited to serve its customers.
4 Table of Contents Bauxite Interests Aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earths crust. Aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The company obtains bauxite from reserves held by AWAC, from the companys interests in Brazil, and under both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2004, Alcoa consumed 31.0 million metric tons (mt) of bauxite from its own reserves, 6.9 million mt from related third parties and 2.7 million mt from unrelated third parties. Alcoas present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future. The following table provides information regarding the companys bauxite interests: Alcoa Active 1 Bauxite Interests Country Project Mining Rights (% Entitlement ) Expiration Date of MiningRights Australia DarlingRangeMines Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA) 2 (100%) 2045 Brazil Poos de Caldas Aluminio (100%) 2017 3 Guinea Bok Compagnie des Bauxites de Guine (CBG) 4 (100%) 2038 5 Jamaica Clarendon/ManchesterPlateau Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica, L.L.C.

Aluminio holds an 8.6% interest, Abalco S.A. (Abalco) holds a 4.6% interest and Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) holds a 5% interest in Minerao Rio do Norte S.A. (MRN), a mining company jointly owned with affiliates of Alcan Inc. (Alcan), Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. MRN owns the Trombetas bauxite-mining project in Brazil. Aluminio and Abalco purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts. AWA LLC has agreed to purchase bauxite from the Trombetas project through 2019. In December 2004, Alcoa announced that it entered into an agreement with Alumina Limited to sell a portion of Alcoas interests in the Juruti (Brazil) bauxite project to AWAC. In exchange, Alumina Limited, Alcoas partner in AWAC, contributed $40 million to AWAC. The Juruti deposit is being considered for development to supply bauxite to AWAC and third party operations, including the Alumar refinery.
2 AofA is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.
3 Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the complete exhaustion of the deposit. Based on proven bauxite reserves and the currently anticipated needs of the Poos de Caldas alumina refinery, Aluminio estimates that the concessions will last at least until 2017. Depending, however, on the refinerys actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are explored and government approval, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.
4 AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 51% and the Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in a 10,000 square-mile area in northwestern Guinea.
5 Alcoa has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that will provide Alcoa with bauxite through 2011.
6 This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies, owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.
7 Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Government of Jamaica.
8 While mining rights extend until 2033, bauxite reserves proven to date extend until 2023.

3 This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies, owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.
4 In 2004, Alcoa received the Western Australian Governments environmental approval for its previously announced Pinjarra alumina refinery efficiency upgrade, which will increase production at the facility by 600,000 mt per year. Completion of the upgrade is expected by the end of 2005.
5 The named company or an affiliate holds this interest.
In December 2004, AWAC and the Government of Jamaica signed an agreement in principle to expand the Jamalco alumina refinery in Clarendon, Jamaica by at least an additional 1.5 million mt per year (mtpy). The expansion will more than double the refinerys total capacity to at least 2.8 million mtpy. In addition, AWAC ownership in the refinery will increase from 50% to 70%. The Government of Jamaica through Clarendon Alumina Production, Ltd. will continue to own the remaining 30%. A final decision to move forward on the project is expected to be made in the first half of 2005. Upon approval, it is expected that the expansion project will be completed by the end of 2007.
In November 2004, AWA LLC, Alcan Inc. and the Government of the Republic of Guinea signed a protocol for developing jointly a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea, West Africa. This protocol sets out the items and framework for the alumina refinery project that will be negotiated as part of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by AWA LLC and Alcan in May 2004. A detailed feasibility study for the refinery is expected to be completed by mid-2005, with construction to begin shortly thereafter. The refinery, which would be operated by Alcoa, would be expected to have an initial 1.5 million mtpy capacity, with expansion capability. Production is expected by early 2008.
6 Table of Contents Alcoa and other joint venture owners of the Alumar refinery in So Lus, Brazil have expedited the engineering efforts and work toward securing permits for the 2 million mtpy expansion of the Alumar alumina refinery. The expansion calls for a retrofit of the existing unit and the addition of a second, state-of-the-art unit at the refinery. Upon completion, the facilitys capacity will be 3.3 million mtpy. It is expected that the project will be completed by early 2007.
In January 2003, Suralco and BHP Billiton signed an MOU with the Government of Suriname providing for (i) continuation and expansion of mining and refining activities in eastern Suriname and (ii) various exploration and other activities over the next two years relating to the feasibility of bauxite and alumina investments in western Suriname. Under the MOU, Suralco and BHP Billiton have exclusive rights in western Suriname and have committed to spend up to $8.5 million over 21-25 months to explore this opportunity, shared 55% (Alcoa) and 45% (BHP Billiton).
In 2003 Suralco broke ground on its capacity expansion at the Paranam alumina refinery in Suriname by 250,000 mtpy, an increase of approximately 13% that will bring total capacity of the plant to approximately 2.2 million mtpy. The expansion is substantially completed as of February 2005, six months ahead of schedule. Suralco and BHP Billiton have also signed an agreement extending the terms of their existing joint venture agreement on bauxite mining and alumina refining in eastern Suriname to 2025.

2 The figures in this column include the minority interests in facilities owned by AofA. Alcoa takes 100% of the production from these facilities.
3 In July 2004, Alcoa cut production from two pot lines to one at the Bcancour aluminum smelter due to a strike at the facility, cutting production to one third of the facilitys capacity. In November 2004, the Syndicat des Mtallurgistes unis d Amerique (local 9700) approved a new five-year labor agreement at the Bcancour smelter. With the new agreement, Alcoa plans to restart the two idled potlines, with full production expected to be reached by the end of April 2005.
4 The Warrick facility currently has one idled potline.
5 The Badin, North Carolina facility has been idled since August 2002.
6 In August 2004, Alcoa announced that it would restart 60,000 mtpy of capacity at its Massena and St. Lawrence, New York facilities which had been idled in May 2003. Upon completion of the restart, the smelters will operate at capacity.
7 Two (of eight) potlines were physically removed from the Rockdale, Texas facility.
8 Table of Contents 8 In November 2003, Alcoa idled an additional potline. Currently, one potline is operating.
9 The Wenatchee, Washington facility has been idled since July 2001. In October 2004, Alcoa announced that workers at the facility, represented by the United Steelworkers of America and the Aluminum Trades Council of Wenatchee, Washington, accepted a new labor agreement. Two of the four lines at the smelter are expected to be restarted by mid-2005, based on availability of acceptable power contracts.
In 2004, Alcoa made significant progress toward restarting smelting capacity at the Wenatchee, Washington; Bcancour, Canada; and Massena and St. Lawrence, New York facilities. Once these restarts are complete, Alcoa will have 361,000 mtpy of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,004,000 mtpy.
In January 2005, Alcoa and the Government of the Republic of Ghana announced that they signed an MOU to evaluate the development an integrated aluminum industry in Ghana that would include bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production and rail transportation infrastructure upgrades. Alcoa will now work with the Government to conduct expedited feasibility studies, including a study on the creation of an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of up to 1.5 million mtpy. These studies are expected to be completed in 2006, at which time the parties would negotiate definitive agreements on mining, refining, smelting, rail upgrades and ownership structure, as well as total investment costs. The MOU also calls for the initial restart of three of the five existing potlines, representing 120,000 mtpy, at the Tema, Ghana smelter owned by Volta Aluminum Company Limited (Valco). Valco is owned 90% by the Government of the Republic of Ghana and 10% by Alcoas subsidiary, Reynolds Metals Company. The smelter, which is currently idled, will be restarted as soon as practical under an interim power rate agreement with the Volta River Authority, with alumina supply arranged by Alcoa.
In November 2004, Alcoa announced that it will invest approximately $284 million to build a new anode plant in Mosjen, Norway. The facility, which will be built together with Elkem ASA, will produce anodes for Alcoas Fjardal, Iceland and Elkem Aluminium ANS Mosjen, Norway smelters. Construction of the anode plant, which is contingent on government approvals, is expected to be completed by 2007.
In October 2004, Alcoa announced that the 2003 MOU between it and the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain was no longer in force. Under the terms of that MOU, Alcoa would have acquired a 26% stake in Alba, a Bahrain company that owns and operates an aluminum smelter with 512,000 mtpy of capacity. The company and the Government were unable to reach mutually acceptable terms to finalize the terms of the MOU.
In September 2004, Alcoa announced the start of an environmental impact assessment under terms of reference established by the Trinidad and Tobago Environmental Authority for a potential aluminum smelter in southwest Trinidad. This followed the signing in May 2004 by Alcoa and the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago of an MOU for a state-of-the-art, low emission smelter with a capacity of at least 250,000 mtpy. The MOU calls for Alcoa to take at least a 60% ownership stake in the smelter, with a Government state enterprise having responsibility for the remainder. Alcoa will take a lead role in the management and operation of the smelter and will have a right to 60% of the metal produced, with the Government state enterprise having a right to the remaining 40%, but with the commitment to make this metal available to downstream investors, including Alcoa.
In July 2004, Alcoa broke ground on its new 322,000 mtpy Fjardal aluminum smelter in East Iceland. Bechtel Group, Inc. and its partner, HRV, an Icelandic engineering consortium, will manage the smelter construction. The smelter is scheduled to begin production in the spring of 2007. In January 2005, an Icelandic district court found, in part, in favor of a plaintiff who was challenging the Icelandic Planning Agencys procedures in performing the environmental assessment which resulted in an Environmental Operating Permit being issued to the Fjardal smelter. The case has been appealed to the Icelandic Supreme Court by both sides. The actual impact of the decision is unknown at this time.
9 Table of Contents In July 2004, Alcoa announced that Aluminio would expand capacity at its share of the So Lus (Alumar) aluminum smelter by 30% or 63,000 mtpy, bringing Aluminios share of smelting capacity there to 262,000 mtpy. When complete, Alcoas share of output from the overall smelter will grow from 54 to 60%. Construction of the expansion began in the fourth quarter of 2004, with production expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In June 2004, Alcoa announced that despite good faith negotiations between the company and the Quebec Government, it could not reach an agreement that would have allowed Alcoa to implement its previously announced plan to expand and upgrade its Baie Comeau, Quebec aluminum smelter. Despite this situation, Alcoa intends to keep the smelter in operation at least until 2010, as long as environmental requirements, energy availability and market conditions will allow.
In February 2004, Alcoa sold its 10% stake in the Alscon smelter in Ikot Abasi, Nigeria to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Alscon smelter was 70% owned by the Federal Government and 20% held by Ferrostaal AG. Only a portion of the facility has ever been operated and has been idle since mid-1999. The Bureau of Public Enterprise, an agency of the Nigerian Government, is working to privatize Alscon. In connection with the sale, the company also terminated its entitlement to purchase all aluminum produced at the smelter for export.
Alcoa also will explore the aluminum smelting and associated hydroelectric power opportunities in western Suriname. In January 2003, Suralco signed an MOU with the Government of Suriname providing for an initial 18-month exclusive period of investigation of the feasibility of smelting and associated hydroelectric power investment in western Suriname. In December 2004, the parties agreed to extend the MOU through December 31, 2005. Under the MOU Alcoa has budgeted $1.5 million - $7.5 million in expenditures over this period to assess the investment potential and, if favorable, to negotiate an investment agreement with the Government.
Alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis method. The capacity associated with these facilities is not included in Alcoas consolidated capacity.

2 In 2003, the smelter was idled due to a power shortage. In 2004, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation sold its 90% interest in the facility to the Government of the Republic of Ghana.
10 Table of Contents Energy Alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power. Electric power accounts for approximately 25% of the companys primary aluminum costs. Alcoa generates approximately 24% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and material long-term power arrangements for Alcoas smelters.
North America - Electricity For its 13 North American smelters, the company (largely through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI)) generates approximately 25% of the power requirements, and generally purchases the remainder under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates two hydroelectric projects consisting of eight dams under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses. The Tapoco hydroelectric project received its new license in January 2005; the Yadkin hydroelectric project license is up for renewal in 2008.
In the Pacific Northwest, Alcoa has a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District located in the State of Washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the Wenatchee smelter through October 2011. In addition, Alcoa has a contract through September 2006 for a limited amount of power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) that can be used at the Wenatchee smelter as well as at the Intalco smelter. Alcoa is currently returning part of its BPA power through the end of the contract period.
The company, through APGI, generates substantially all of the power used at its Warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves. A 1996 coal supply contract satisfies up to 70% of the smelters fuel requirements through June 2006. Annual contracts satisfy the remainder of the fuel requirements. In April 2001, under the terms of an operating agreement, the company assumed operation of the power plants that supply the Warrick smelter from Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company until at least 2008.
Power for the Rockdale smelter is generated by company-owned generating units and TXU Generation Company LP-owned generating units, both using lignite supplied by the companys Sandow Mine. The company is in the process of opening a new lignite mine, the Three Oaks Mine, on adjacent land it owns or controls. Company-owned generating units supply about one half of the total electricity requirements of the smelter, although this capacity will retire not later than 2007. TXU Generation Company LP supplies the balance through a long-term power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038, with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price.
APGI hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at Alcoa, Tennessee and Badin, North Carolina. APGI received a renewed 40-year FERC license for the Tapoco project in 2005. The Tennessee smelter also purchases power from the Tennessee Valley Authority under a contract that extends to 2010. With the Badin smelter idled, power generated from APGIs Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing, Inc.
In the Northeast, the purchased power contracts for the Massena and St. Lawrence, New York smelters expire not earlier than June 30, 2013, following their extension for 10 years upon New York Power Authority having relicensed one of its hydroelectric projects. The company, however, may terminate either of these contracts with one years notice.
The Deschambault and Bcancour smelters located in Quebec purchase electricity under long-term contracts with Hydro-Quebec that expire in 2014, subject to extension provisions. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Quebec purchases approximately 65% of its power needs under the Hydro-Quebec contract and receives the rest of its power needs from a 40%-owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Company.
11 Table of Contents The Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland and the Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina purchase electricity under contracts that expire December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2015, respectively, subject to certain extension provisions.
Australia - Electricity Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by AofA, and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for the companys smelter in Point Henry, Victoria. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively.
Brazil - Electricity The Alumar smelter conducted an auction to purchase electric power for the period from July 2004 to December 2024, as its prior agreement expired in June 2004. Centrais Elctricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.  Eletronorte won the auction, and a new electric power supply contract was entered into in June 2004.
Aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil, which began to generate power at full capacity in 2002. Aluminio receives its share of the plants output, which is sufficient to cover the remaining 51% of its operating needs at the Poos de Caldas smelter.
Aluminio also has a 42% interest in Energtica Barra Grande S.A.  BAESA, which is building the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. Barra Grande is expected to reach full generating capacity in 2006. Aluminios share of the project will cover an additional portion of its currently purchased needs at the Poos de Caldas smelter.
Europe - Electricity The company purchases electricity for its Italian smelters in the recently deregulated market, under annual contracts and special conditions expiring in December 2005 for the Fusina smelter, and in June 2007 for the Portevesme smelter, which benefits from some new measures applicable to heavy industry located on the island of Sardinia. These new measures are, however, under a state aid inquiry by the European Union (EU), and the Italian government will respond to the EU in the first half of 2005.
The companys smelters at San Ciprin, La Corua and Avils, Spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in December 2006, which possibly may be extended to 2010.
Iceland  Electricity As noted above, Alcoa broke ground in 2004 on construction of its new Fjaral smelter in Eastern Iceland. Central to those arrangements is a 40-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, will build a dam and power project, and supply competitively priced electricity to the smelter.
Minority Interests - Electricity The smelters in Germany, Ghana, Norway and Venezuela, in which Alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager, have made a variety of long-term electricity purchase arrangements, under the managing partner or entity. The power contract for Germany runs through December 2005; discussions are underway with the supplier, HEW, regarding a possible extension. The other contracts are up for renewal at various times, the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020.
12 Table of Contents Canada & U.S. - Natural Gas The company generally procures natural gas on a competitively bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoas larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or NYMEX price. The company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.
Australia - Natural Gas AofA holds a 20% equity interest in a consortium which bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline transports gas from the North West gas fields to Alcoas alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials The major purchased raw materials in 2004 for each of the companys segments are listed below.
Alumina & Chemicals Primary Metals bauxite alumina caustic soda aluminum fluoride electricity calcined petroleum coke fuel oil carbon natural gas cathode blocks caustic soda electricity liquid pitch natural gas silicon carbide Flat-Rolled Products Engineered Products alloying materials cobalt aluminum scrap electricity coatings natural gas electricity nickel natural gas nitrogen primary aluminum (rolling ingot) primary aluminum (billet) steel titanium Packaging & Consumer Other aluminum aluminum tape electricity copper natural gas glass fiber paper photopolymer polyethylene resin compound polyvinyl chloride resin compound polypropylene resin compound polyvinyl chloride resin compound 13 Table of Contents Other materials generally are purchased from third party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. The company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available.

In December 2004, Alcoa and Fujikura signed a Letter of Intent in which Alcoa will obtain complete ownership of the AFL automotive business. The transaction, which is expected to be implemented through a share exchange by Fujikura of all of its AFL shares for all shares in a new telecommunications subsidiary, including cash, should be completed in the first half of 2005.
Alcoa Kobe Transportation Products, Inc. and Kobe Alcoa Transportation Products Ltd.
These joint ventures, owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe), continue despite the termination in 2003 of the Alcoa-Kobe joint ventures in rolled aluminum sheet products for aluminum cans. The focus of these ventures, consisting of one company in the U.S. and one in Japan, is to expand the use of aluminum sheet products in passenger cars and light trucks. As a result of a restructuring of the venture in 2000, the U.S. company focuses on research and development efforts, while the Japanese company engages in commercial (manufacturing, marketing and sales) as well as research and development efforts, to serve the transportation industry. In 2003, Alcoa and Kobe further agreed to discuss extending this cooperation into joint research and development products related to other aluminum automotive products such as applied technology of aluminum extrusion and casting.
Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Company Limited.
Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Company Limited is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Shanghai Light Industry Equipment (Group) Co., Ltd. It produces aluminum foil products in Shanghai, China.
Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco).
In November 2001, Alcoa entered into a strategic alliance with Chalco and its parent company, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco). Under this alliance, in 2001 Alcoa became a strategic investor in Chalcos global offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Alcoas investment is 8% of the issued and outstanding shares. In connection with its investment, Alcoa is entitled to one seat on Chalcos board of directors. In early 2004, Chalco made an additional public share offering in which Alcoa purchased sufficient shares to maintain its holdings in Chalco at the 8% level. Chinalco remains the largest shareholder in Chalco. As part of the strategic alliance, Alcoa and Chalco also agreed that they would enter into a Sino-foreign joint venture at Chalcos facility in Pingguo. Pingguo is one of the most efficient alumina and aluminum production facilities in China and is located in the Guangxi region. The Pingguo joint venture will be owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Chalco. Alcoa will transfer management, operational and technical expertise, and best practices to the Pingguo joint venture. The parties continue to work diligently on terms of their joint venture and to obtain the necessary government approvals.

Alcoa is currently in the process of evaluating the offer, which remains open through March 8, 2005.
Yunnan Xinmeilu Aluminum Foil Co., Ltd.
This joint venture is owned 56% by Alcoa and 44% by Yunnan Aluminum Processing Factory. It produces aluminum foil products in Kunming, China. Alcoa does not have management control of this facility.
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks The company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The companys rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoas business is not, however, materially dependent on patents, and no individual patent is of material importance to any segment.
The company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.
The company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer level, and others that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include Alcoa and the Alcoa Symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck fasteners, Kawneer building panels, Dura Bright surface treatments, Presto storage bags, Cut-Rite wax paper, Baco household wraps, Reynolds plastic wrap and Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil. The companys rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.
Competitive Conditions Alcoa is the worlds leading producer of alumina, primary aluminum and fabricated aluminum. Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoas markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials  such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications; steel, plastics and glass for packaging applications; and wood and vinyl for building and construction applications  aluminums diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability and flexibility, are also significant factors. For Alcoas segments that market products under Alcoas brand names, brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role.
Research and Development Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Alcoa conducts these activities within its businesses and at the Alcoa Technical Center near Pittsburgh. Expenditures for R&D activities were $182 million in 2004, $190 million in 2003 and $209 million in 2002.
15 Table of Contents Most of the major process and product areas within the company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding product and process area, developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Certain business units alternatively conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center. Technical personnel from the TMRBs, the Technical Center and such business units also participate in the corresponding Market Sector Lead Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.
During 2004, the company continued work on new developments in inert anode technology and the pursuit of patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world related to these advanced technologies. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of anode assembly testing, although there remain technical and cost targets to overcome. Technical targets include improvement of anode life, optimization of pot operating conditions and maintenance of metal purity. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the company believes that it would be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology, resulting in significant operating cost savings. The new technology would also generate environmental benefits by reducing and eliminating certain emissions. No timetable has been established for commercial use.
Environmental Matters Information relating to environmental matters is included in three areas of the Annual Report: under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Environmental Matters on pages 33 and 34, in Note A to the financial statements under the caption Environmental Expenditures on page 45 and in Note Y to the financial statements on pages 61 and 62.
Employees Total worldwide employment at year-end 2004 was 119,000 people.
In November 2004, the Syndicat des Mtallurgistes unis d Amerique (local 9700) approved a new five-year labor agreement at the Bcancour, Quebec smelter.
In October 2004, Alcoa and the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and the Aluminum Trades Council of Wenatchee, Washington, an affiliate of the USWA, reached an agreement at Alcoas idled smelter in Wenatchee. Upon union approval of the agreement, Alcoa took steps to restart two of the four lines at the smelter, which has been idled since July 2001. The restart is expected to be completed by mid-2005.
Also in October 2004, Alcoa and the USWA jointly announced that the parties had resolved their dispute over contracting-out work that resulted in four Alcoa locations being served with 5-day notices. Union members at Alcoa plants in Alcoa, Tennessee; Evansville, Indiana; Rockdale, Texas; and Davenport, Iowa each asked for five days of talks with Alcoa management in July 2004 regarding grievances involving subcontracting.
On October 12, 2001, the USWA ratified a new five-year labor agreement that covers 19 locations in the United States and about 12,000 employees. The contract is effective from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2006.
Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Forward-Looking Statements This report and the portions of the Annual Report incorporated by reference herein contain (and oral communications made by Alcoa may contain) forward-looking statements that may be identified by their use of words like anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, hopes, targets, should, will, will likely result, 16 Table of Contents forecast, outlook, projects or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address Alcoas expectations or projections about the future, including statements about Alcoas strategy for growth, cost reduction goals, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on Alcoas estimates, assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Alcoa cannot guarantee that these estimates, assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. Alcoa disclaims any intention or obligation (other than as required by law) to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Risk Factors In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in Managements Discussion and Analysis in the Annual Report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause Alcoas actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements:  Alcoa is the worlds leading producer of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina. The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences. Prices can be volatile. Although Alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers, as well as forward, futures and options contracts, to manage its exposure to the volatility of LME-based prices, and is product and segment diversified, Alcoas results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by Alcoa, including the transportation, building, construction, distribution, packaging, industrial gas turbine and other markets.
Alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations. Although Alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, the following could affect Alcoas results of operations:  significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;  significant increases in natural gas prices;  unavailability of electrical power due to droughts;  interruptions in energy supply due to equipment failure or other causes; or  inability to extend contracts upon expiration on economical terms.
Alcoas ability to grow earnings will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, including caustic soda, calcined petroleum coke and resins, in addition to energy. Alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.
As part of its strategy for growth, Alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met.
Alcoa has investments, activities and significant expansion projects in numerous countries outside the U.S. and in emerging markets, including Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, India, Jamaica, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Suriname and Trinidad. These significant expansion projects are in various stages of development and, depending on business and/or regulatory circumstances, may not be completed. Changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which Alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and Alcoas results of operations.
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and competitive factors in the countries in which Alcoa operates, could affect its revenues, expenses and results of operations. In particular, lower valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, particularly the Australian dollar, may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies, while products generally are sold in U.S. dollars.
17 Table of Contents  The markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive. In addition, aluminum competes with other materials, such as steel, plastics and glass, among others, for various applications in Alcoas key markets. The willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by Alcoa, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting Alcoas competitors or customers could affect Alcoas results of operations.
A significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by Alcoa could affect Alcoas results of operations in a particular period.
Alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance, including deployment of company-wide business process models, such as the Alcoa Business System and the Alcoa Enterprise Business Solution, an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across Alcoa for data, processes and supporting software. Alcoa also has undertaken a three-year cost savings challenge aimed at eliminating $1.2 billion in costs by the end of 2006. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.
Alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies, including inert anode technology. There can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Alcoa.
Alcoas operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to several sites. Climate change agreements in several parts of the world may result in emission restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or intepretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Alcoa, including product liability, safety and health and other claims.
Alcoas estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). Alcoas results of operations, liquidity or shareholders equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions.
Unexpected events, including supply disruptions, labor disputes, failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications, war or terrorist activities may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact Alcoas financial performance.
The above list of important factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.

Alcoa leases some of its facilities; however, it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or their values. The company leases a portion of the equipment and facilities at its Texarkana, Texas plant. AFL and Southern Graphic Systems, Inc. lease most of their facilities. The portion of the packaging group that runs former Ivex Packaging Corporation plants, leases certain of its facilities.
Alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of properties owned by Alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report, the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties. See Notes H and U to the financial statements for information on properties, plants and equipment and lease expense.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
In the ordinary course of its business, Alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. It is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies. Management believes, however, that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company.
Environmental Matters Alcoa is involved in proceedings under the Superfund or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites.
Since 1989, Alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the Grasse River, adjacent to Alcoas Massena, New York plant site, under order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under Section 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA). Sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). In the fourth quarter of 1999, Alcoa submitted an Analysis of Alternatives Report to the EPA. This Report identified potential courses of remedial action related to the PCB contamination of the river. The EPA indicated to Alcoa that it believed additional remedial alternatives needed to be included in the Analysis of Alternatives Report. During 2000 and 2001, Alcoa completed certain studies and investigations on the river, 21 Table of Contents including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies. In February 2002, Alcoa submitted a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report based on these additional evaluations and included additional remedial alternatives required by the EPA. The range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report is between $2 million and $525 million. Alcoa believes that rational, scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or man-made processes. Based on the current assessment of the EPA decision-making process, the company has now concluded that the selection of the $2 million alternative, based on natural recovery only, is remote. Because the selection of the $2 million alternative was considered remote, Alcoa adjusted the reserve for the Grasse River in 2002 to $30 million. In June 2003, based on river observations during the spring of 2003, the EPA requested that Alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered. The results of these additional studies, submitted in a report to the EPA in April of 2004, suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios. Those evaluations were submitted to EPA along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river. In May 2004, EPA approved these additional studies, known as Remedial Options Pilot Studies (ROPS). Most of the work for this study should be completed by the fourth quarter of 2005. It is anticipated that a report of findings will be issued to the EPA in 2006. Subsequent to this submittal, a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report will be submitted to EPA at a date to be determined. This information will be used by the EPA to propose a remedy for the entire river.
Alcoa has reserved an additional $35 million to perform the study described above in 2005.
Even while the reserve was adjusted to account for the ROPS activity, once that field work is completed, including capping and potentially substantial sediment removal, the company is not now able to know with certainty when the EPA will reach a final remedial decision nor estimate how such a decision will be valued.
Representatives of various U.S. federal and state agencies and a Native American tribe, acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources, have asserted that Alcoa and Reynolds Metals Company (Reynolds) may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on Alcoas and Reynolds operations at their Massena, New York and St. Lawrence, New York facilities. While formal proceedings have not been instituted, the company continues to actively investigate these claims.
Since 1990, Alcoa has undertaken investigations and evaluations concerning alleged releases of mercury from its Point Comfort, Texas facility into the adjacent Lavaca Bay pursuant to a Superfund order from the EPA. In March 1994, the EPA listed the Alcoa (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay Site on the National Priorities List, and Alcoa and Region VI of the EPA entered into an administrative order on consent, EPA docket no. 6-11-94, concerning the site. The administrative order required the company to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study under EPA oversight. Following submission by the company of all required information, in December 2001, the EPA issued its Record of Decision selecting the final remedial approach for the site. In addition, the company and certain federal and state natural resource trustees, who previously served Alcoa with notice of their intent to file suit to recover damages for alleged loss or injury of natural resources in Lavaca Bay, have cooperatively identified restoration alternatives and approaches for resource injuries at the site.
Negotiations between Alcoa and the EPA and other federal and state agencies responsible for remediation and natural resource damage assessment were completed and two Consent Decrees covering those matters, respectively, were concluded. The Consent Decrees were lodged in federal district court in Texas on December 10, 2004. After a period for public comment, the Consent Decrees are expected to be formally entered by the court early in 2005. The actions required by those Consent Decrees which are consistent with the Record of Decision and the identified resource restoration alternatives, are fully reserved.
In May through October 2002, eleven lawsuits were filed against Reynolds and Alcoa in the District Court of Wharton County, Texas and one in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Victoria Division .
The lawsuits seek to recover damages relating to the presence of trichloroethylene in the groundwater near a former Reynolds extrusion facility in El Campo, Texas. Three of the cases were later dismissed, and all except one of the remaining cases have been consolidated into a single case in the District Court of Wharton County, Texas. None of the defendants have been served in the unconsolidated case, and 22 Table of Contents there has been no activity in that case since filing. Bon L Campo Limited Partnership and its parent, Tredegar Corporation, operators of the plant from 1997-2000, have also been listed among the defendants in some of the lawsuits, and Reynolds has brought its predecessor in interest, Whittaker Corporation, into the litigation. Several of the Petitions indicate that plaintiffs will request certification of class status for other allegedly affected individuals; however, none of the plaintiffs have filed motions for class certification to date. The only significant personal injury claim settled in 2003. Alcoa, on behalf of itself, Reynolds, a Reynolds subsidiary, Bon L Campo LP, and Tredegar, has settled with most of the plaintiffs with property within the known affected area. After a number of dismissals, approximately 655 plaintiffs remain unsettled. Motions for summary judgment are pending against these remaining plaintiffs, but the Court has not ruled on them. No trial date has been set for these remaining claims.
In August 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) notified IPC, Inc. (IPC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ivex Packaging Corporation (Ivex), and Consolidated Fibers, Inc. (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of IPC, that they were potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA at the Agriculture Street Landfill Superfund Site, New Orleans, Louisiana. In August 2002, the EPA and DOJ extended an offer to CFI to engage in pre-filing settlement discussions regarding the United States claim for response costs at the Site. The EPA and DOJ stated that the government had incurred approximately $40.6 million in response costs at the Site and sought a settlement amount of approximately $13.8 million to be paid collectively by CFI and other PRPs. Ivex contends that CFIs involvement with the site was minimal. The United States filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on December 6, 2002 for recovery of its response costs. CFI was named as a defendant. On December 10, 2004, the parties agreed to settle the case with CFI paying $1.75 million. The parties have reached agreement on final consent decree language.
On September 26, 2003, EPA Region VI filed an administrative Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against Howmet Corporations Wichita Falls, Texas facility for violations of hazardous waste regulations relating to shipments of used potassium hydroxide to a fertilizer manufacturer from 1997 until 2000. The Complaint proposes a penalty of $265,128. In addition, the EPA ordered Howmet Corporation (Howmet) to cease sending used potassium hydroxide to fertilizer manufacturers or employing used potassium hydroxide in any use constituting disposal and to certify compliance with hazardous waste regulations within 30 days. On October 22, 2003, EPA Region II issued an almost identical Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against Howmets Dover, New Jersey facility, seeking $180,021 in penalties. On October 28, 2003 and December 8, 2003, Howmet filed its Answers to EPA Region VIs and EPA Region IIs Complaints, respectively. Howmets Answers denied the substance of EPAs Complaints, requested that no penalties be imposed and requested Hearings on both the hazardous waste allegations and the Compliance Orders. These matters are pending before the EPA.
In September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck the United States Virgin Islands, including the St. Croix Alumina LLC facility on the island of St. Croix. That facility, at the time, was under 60% ownership by Alcoa through various intermediate entities. The wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas. Various clean-up and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on behalf of St. Croix Alumina. A Notice of Violation was issued by the Division of Environmental Protection of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources of the Virgin Islands Government, and has been contested by the company. A civil suit was commenced in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands by certain residents of St. Croix in February 1999 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries and property damages associated with bauxite or red dust from the St. Croix Alumina facility. The suit, which has been removed to the District Court of the Virgin Islands, names St. Croix Alumina LLC, Alcoa Inc. and Glencore Ltd. (a former owner of the facility) as defendants and in August 2000 was accorded class action treatment. The class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who suffered damages and/or injuries as a result of exposure during and after Hurricane Georges to red dust and red mud blown during Hurricane Georges. All of the defendants have denied liability, and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since 1999. In October 2003, the defendants received plaintiffs expert reports. These reports claim that the material blown during Hurricane Georges consisted of bauxite and red mud, and contained crystalline silica, chromium and other substances. The reports go on to claim, among other things, that the population of the six subject neighborhoods as of the 23 Table of Contents 2000 census (a total of 3,730 people) has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants, and hence will be able to show entitlement to lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and punitive relief. These opinions are in the process of being contested by the defendants. Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina LLC have turned over the defense of this matter to their insurance carriers .
The Court has ordered the parties to attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation.
In 2001 and 2002, two companion lawsuits were filed in the Court of Lafayette County, Arkansas on behalf of nearly 400 current or former residents of the City of Stamps, Arkansas, the City of Stamps and former employees of Red River Aluminum, Inc. (RRA), a dross processor. The 2001 action has been transferred to Miller County, Arkansas. The suits name 12 defendants (including Alumax, Reynolds and Alcoa) that sent dross to RRA for processing. Plaintiffs have filed claims for personal injuries and property damage and have alleged that the defendants violated Arkansas environmental statutes relating to the alleged contamination associated with RRAs operations in Stamps. The 2001 action was settled in May 2004. The cost of the settlement was previously reserved for and was not material to Alcoa. The 2002 action was dismissed, without prejudice, at the requests of plaintiffs in June 2004. In June 2004, the City of Stamps withdrew its claims, without prejudice. It now has one year in which to re-file its claims. Should the City of Stamps re-file, any result of that suit is at this time neither estimable nor probable.
Other Matters Along with various asbestos manufacturers, distributors and premises users, Alcoa and/or its subsidiaries are defendants in several hundred active individual lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos at various company facilities. In addition to the above cases, an Alcoa subsidiary has been routinely named, along with a large common group of industrial companies, in a standardized complaint utilized by one particular law firm where the companys involvement is not evident. Since 1999 several thousand such complaints have been filed. To date, Alcoas subsidiary has been dismissed from almost every case that was actually placed in line for trial. Alcoa, its subsidiaries and acquired companies, all have had numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims. Many of these policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations. Alcoa believes that between its reserves and insurance it is adequately covered for its known asbestos exposures. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the financial condition of the company.
In July 1999, Alcoa Aluminio S.A. received notice that an administrative proceeding was commenced by Brazils Secretary of Economic Law of the Ministry of Justice against Brazilian producers of primary aluminum, including Alcoa Aluminio. The suit alleges collusive action in the pricing of primary aluminum in violation of Brazilian antitrust law. Alcoa Aluminio has presented its defense and is awaiting the decision of the Secretary of Economic Law. If the Secretary of Economic Law determines that the antitrust law was violated, then the action may be further prosecuted by the Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE). Brazilian law provides for civil and criminal sanctions for violations of antitrust law, including fines ranging from 1% to 30% of a companys revenue during the last fiscal year. On July 6, 2004, the Office of Economic Law of the Ministry of Justice decided not to pursue the case in light of the lack of evidence of infringement of the antitrust law. This decision will be referred to the CADE for review.
As previously reported, in the first half of 2002, Alcoa discovered that a former Reynolds distribution entity, RASCO, may have sold approximately 750,000 pounds of aluminum plate made by an unrelated company for use in the Northwest maritime industry that may not be suitable for that use. Reynolds and the current owner of the business and the manufacturer of the metal are working jointly to identify the issues and find resolutions. All identified customers have been notified of the issue, inspection protocols have been put into place and the U.S. Coast Guard has been notified and is involved in the resolution process. Three lawsuits were originally filed by ship owners or operators and each has been resolved. The parties have been working cooperatively toward satisfactory resolutions. During 2004, Alcoa reached resolution of a coverage suit with one of its carriers and used a portion of the proceeds to establish a reserve to cover the expected remaining claims. A suit has been filed against the manufacturers and sellers of the material.
24 Table of Contents On January 28, 2005, in the context of an informal investigation being conducted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to certain trade payables financing, the company received a request for the voluntary provision of documents and related information concerning the classification and disclosure of certain trade accounts payable transactions for periods beginning after December 31, 2002 that involve, directly or indirectly, an intermediary. The SEC staff has advised the company that the inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred, or as an adverse reflection upon any person or security. Alcoa is fully cooperating with this inquiry.

4 The Alcoa Fee Continuation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, adopted in 1990, provided fee continuation payments for persons who met a minimum service requirement as a non-employee director. Each of the ten eligible participants receives (or will receive) such cash and stock payments for life upon retirement from the Board, or age 65 (whichever is later), based upon the cash retainer fee for directors and an annual stock grant under the companys former Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. In 1995, the Board froze future annual payments to eligible directors at a maximum of $30,000 and 2,000 shares (or a lesser proportion based on service). The Plan was otherwise terminated at that time. Alcoas practice has been to use treasury shares for such share payments. All current fees and other compensation for directors are outlined under Directors Compensation on page 11 of the Proxy Statement.
