Overview Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent approximately three-fourths of Alcoas revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum 3 Table of Contents products include precision castings, industrial fasteners, consumer products, food service and flexible packaging products, plastic closures, and electrical distribution systems for cars and trucks. Alcoas products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, consumer products, building and construction, and industrial applications.
Alcoa is a global company operating in 44 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, North America and Europe generated 57% and 25%, respectively, of Alcoas sales. In addition, Alcoa has investments and activities in Australia, Brazil, China, Iceland, Jamaica, Guinea, and Russia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.
Alcoas operations consist of six worldwide segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, Extruded and End Products, Engineered Solutions, and Packaging and Consumer.
The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10 (a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.
Recent Developments In October 2007, Alcoa announced that it had reviewed strategic alternatives related to its Electrical and Electronic Solutions business (formerly the Alcoa Fujikura Limited wire harness business) and approved a targeted restructuring plan to improve future returns and profitability.
In November 2007, Alcoa completed the sale of its automotive castings business to Compass Automotive Group, LLC, a portfolio company of Monomoy Capital Partners, L.P. The Alcoa business had 2006 revenues of approximately $150 million and employed approximately 530 employees in two operating locations: Fruitport, MI and Farsund, Norway. Alcoa will continue to operate its other automotive businesses globally, including its facility in Soest, Germany.
In December 2007, Alcoa agreed to sell its packaging and consumer businesses to New Zealands Rank Group Limited for $2.7 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2008. Alcoas packaging and consumer businesses include Closure Systems International, Consumer Products, Flexible Packaging and Reynolds Food Packaging. These businesses generated approximately $3.3 billion in revenues in 2007 and employed approximately 9,300 employees in 22 countries around the world. Alcoa will continue to operate its flat-rolled can sheet products business serving the packaging market.
On February 1, 2008, Alcoa announced that the company joined with the Aluminum Corporation of China to acquire 12% of the U.K. common stock of Rio Tinto plc (RTP) for approximately $14 billion. Of this amount, Alcoa contributed $1.2 billion on February 6, 2008. The investment was made through a special purpose vehicle called Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. (SPPL), which is a private limited liability company, created for the purpose of acquiring the RTP shares. The RTP shares were purchased on the open market through an investment broker.
Bauxite Interests Aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earths crust. Aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The company obtains bauxite from resources held by AWAC, from the companys interests in the countries listed in the chart below, and under both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2007, Alcoa consumed 34.8million metric tons (mt) of bauxite from its own resources, 5.9million mt from related third 4 Table of Contents parties and 3.5million mt from unrelated third parties. Alcoas present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future. The following table provides information regarding the companys bauxite interests: Alcoa Active Bauxite Interests 1 Country Project Owners Mining Rights (% Entitlement ) Expiration Date of Mining Rights Australia DarlingRangeMines Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA) 2 (100%) 2045 Brazil PoosdeCaldas Alcoa Aluminio S.A.

2 AofA is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.
3 Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the complete exhaustion of the deposit. The company estimates that (i)the concessions at Poos de Caldas will last at least until 2020 and (ii)the concessions at Trombetas will last until 2046. Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are explored and government approval, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.
4 Aluminio holds an 8.6% interest, Abalco S.A. (Abalco) holds a 4.6% interest and Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) holds a 5% interest in MRN. Abalco and AWA LLC are both part of the AWAC group of companies and are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. MRN is jointly owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (formerly Alcan Inc.), Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. Aluminio, Abalco, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts.
5 AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 100% of Bok Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of CBG. The Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile perimeter in northwestern Guinea.
6 AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that will provide Alcoa with bauxite through 2011.
7 This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.
8 Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Government of Jamaica.
9 In addition to the other named Suriname interests, Lelydorp was an active site until the mine was exhausted and closed in February 2007. While mining rights at Caramacca extend until 2012 and rights at the remaining Suriname locations extend until 2033, it is likely that all Suriname bauxite resources will also be exhausted within the next several years. Alcoa is evaluating alternate sources of bauxite including resources located in western Suriname.

3 This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.
4 In 2004, Alcoa received the Western Australian Governments environmental approval for its previously announced Pinjarra alumina refinery efficiency upgrade, which increased production at the facility by 657,000 mtpy. Full production was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2006. Ramp up to full production at the Pinjarra refinery was impacted in December 2006 and 2007 due to a power failure at the refinery and de-bottlenecking requirements related to the upgrade.
5 The named company or an affiliate holds this interest.
6 In August 2007, production at the Clarendon refinery was temporarily curtailed as part of safety precautionary measures in advance of Hurricane Dean. The bauxite mine and refinery suffered little damage from the storm, but the refinery was temporarily shut down due to loss of power. The Rocky Point port from which Jamalco ships alumina sustained substantial damage and required significant repairs, as well as temporary logistical support for shipping alumina while repair work was completed. Repair work included preparing storage for alumina which resulted in limiting production from the facility to 50 percent of capacity. Alcoa declared force majeure to its customers. The refinery has restarted and is expected to achieve pre-shutdown production levels in the 2008 first quarter. The port has been temporarily repaired and shipments are currently being made from that facility. Permanent repairs to the port are expected to be completed during 2008.
7 Production at Point Comfort was temporarily affected during the first quarter 2007 due to a general labor disturbance in Guinea that closed the port from which the Guinea Bok mine supplies this facility with bauxite.
In January 2005, Alcoa and the Government of the Republic of Ghana announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), under which the parties would evaluate the possible development of an integrated aluminum industry in Ghana, including bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production, and rail transportation infrastructure upgrades. The parties are no longer pursuing the contemplated projects.
6 Table of Contents In September 2005, Alcoa announced that its Board of Directors approved plans to make further investments in the companys Brazilian upstream operations. Investments include (i)a 2.1million mtpy expansion of the Alumar consortium alumina refinery in So Lus, state of Maranho (expected to increase the refinerys current capacity to approximately 3.5million mtpy in 2009, with Alcoas share of the total facility output more than doubling to 1.89million mtpy based on its 54% ownership stake through Aluminio and AWAC) and (ii)the modernization of the Poos de Caldas aluminum smelter, in the state of Minas Gerais.
In November 2005, Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. announced the signing of a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. The Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly in May of 2006 and was promulgated into law by decree of the President of Guinea in July of 2006.
In April 2006, AWAC signed an MOU with Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) under which the parties will explore the feasibility of creating a joint venture to develop a bauxite mine and alumina refinery in the Dak Nong province of Vietnam. The cooperation between AWAC and Vinacomin is subject to approval by the Government of Vietnam. The Government of Vietnam issued a Master Plan for the aluminum industry in November 2007. The investment model stipulated in the Master Plan is a Joint Stock Company. If established, the venture would be 51% owned by Vinacomin, with the ownership share of AWAC to be agreed.
In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2million mtpy. This approval includes a variety of environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa can seek construction approval for the project. The environmental approval paves the way for Alcoa to proceed to the next stage of project design, the feasibility study. The pre-feasibility phase of the project has been extended into 2008.
In 2007, Jamalco completed the Early Works Program at its Clarendon, Jamaica refinery, which added 146,000 mtpy of production, increasing the total capacity to 1.421 million mtpy. As a result of the Early Works Program, AWACs ownership in Jamalco has increased to approximately 55%, with the Government of Jamaica owning approximately 45%.
The 1.5 million mtpy planned expansion of Jamalcos Clarendon, Jamaica refinery is subject to supply of natural gas by the Government of Jamaica and acceptable market conditions. As of December 31, 2007, AWAC has capitalized approximately $84 million of engineering costs related to this project (Alcoas share of these costs is approximately $50 million).

3 Figures include the minority interest of Alumina Limited in facilities owned by AofA. From these facilities, Alcoa takes 100% of the production allocated to AofA.
4 In March 2006, Aluminio completed a 30% expansion of the capacity of its share of the So Lus (Alumar) aluminum smelter, increasing Aluminios share of smelting capacity there by 62,000 mtpy and Aluminios share of smelter output from 53.66% to 60%.
8 Table of Contents 5 Owned through Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. subsidiary Pechiney Reynolds Quebec, Inc.
6 In April 2007, Alcoa began production at its new Fjaral aluminum smelter in east Iceland. Full production is expected to be achieved in the 2008 first quarter.
7 The Warrick facility currently has one idled potline.
8 At the end of 2005, all production was temporarily curtailed at the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland. In July 2006, Alcoa acquired the minority interest in this smelter from Mitsui& Co. Ltd. resulting in Alcoa owning 100% of the facility.
9 The Badin, North Carolina facility has been idled since August 2002. In addition, one of the two idled potlines was fully decommissioned in 2007 and will not be returned to service. The decommissioning has reduced Nameplate and Alcoa Consolidated Capacities by 60,000 mtpy.
10 A power line failed during a severe storm at Tennessee Operations in April 2007. Although full power was quickly restored, one of the two potlines, representing approximately 107,000 mpty, remained idle until late May 2007. Production on the line increased throughout 2007 and is expected to be fully restored by the end of the first quarter of 2008 .
11 In May 2007, one potline was temporarily idled at Rockdale, Texas. The restart of the line was completed during the fourth quarter of 2007.
12 In July 2006, Alcoa acquired the minority interest in the Intalco smelter from Mitsui& Co. Ltd. resulting in Alcoa owning 100% of the facility. Intalco had been operating at one-third of its capacity but re-energized a second of its three potlines in February 2007, increasing annual production to approximately 190,000 mtpy.
13 Wenatchee is operating at approximately one-half of its capacity.
Alcoa currently has 452,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 4,573,000 mtpy.
In February 2006, Alcoa signed an Agreement in Principle with the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago to build a 341,000 mtpy aluminum smelter in the Cap-de-Ville area in southwestern Trinidad. This agreement followed the signing of an MOU in May 2004 for participation by Alcoa in the development of an aluminum industry in Trinidad and Tobago. In December 2006, the Government advised Alcoa of its intention to relocate the smelter. Although the parties had expected to resume negotiations in 2007, they have not done so.
Alcoa and the Government of Iceland have begun detailed feasibility studies for the development of a 250,000 mtpy aluminum smelter at Bakki near Hsavk in north Iceland. Additionally, separate MOU agreements between Alcoa and Landvirkjun and Alcoa and Landsnet covering development of power generation and transmission for this smelter project were signed in May 2006. If the feasibility studies prove the viability of the proposed smelter, it is expected that ground would not be broken before 2010.
In May 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Cabinet entered into an MOU regarding cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 340,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. Under the MOU, the parties will begin site selection, environmental studies, engineering assessments, and other aspects of the project. If the viability of the project is proved, ground breaking for the hydroelectric power system would be expected in 2010 and for the smelter in 2012.
In September 2007, Alcoa opened a new 280,000 mtpy anode plant in Mosjen, Norway. The facility, built together with Elkem Aluminium ANS which has a 36% share in the plant, will produce anodes for Alcoas Fjaral, Iceland and Elkem Aluminium ANS Mosjen, Norway smelters. Anodes were delivered to both smelters during the third quarter of 2007. Elkem Aluminium ANS is a partnership owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Orkla ASA, through Orklas subsidiary Elkem AS, as further described in the Joint Ventures and Investments section below.
In January 2008, Alcoa and the Brunei Economic Development Board signed an MOU to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam. The MOU extends a memorandum signed originally in 2003. Phase one of the feasibility study will determine scope and dimensions of the proposed facility, power-delivery strategy, location, as well as an associated port and infrastructure. At completion of phase one, the parties will determine whether a more detailed phase two study is warranted. If completed, it is expected that the smelter would have an initial operating capacity of 360,000 mtpy with the potential for future increase.
9 Table of Contents Alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis method. The capacity associated with these facilities is not included in Alcoas consolidated capacity.

2 In 2003, the smelter at the Tema facility was idled due to shortage of available power. As of year-end 2005, two potlines had been restarted. Throughout 2006, however, the smelter operated at approximately 38% capacity due to limited power availability resulting from low water levels at Lake Volta. In April 2007, the facility was fully idled again. Ghana continues to be subject to power limitations and future production of the smelter will be subject to energy availability.
Energy Alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power. Electric power accounts for approximately 30% of the companys primary aluminum costs. Alcoa generates approximately 24% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoas smelters.
North America  Electricity The companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 25% of the power requirements for Alcoas North American smelters. The company generally purchases the remainder under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates two hydroelectric projects, Tapoco and Yadkin, consisting of eight dams under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses. APGI hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at Alcoa, Tennessee and Badin, North Carolina. The Tennessee smelter also purchases power from the Tennessee Valley Authority under a contract that extends to 2010.
APGI received a renewed 40-year FERC license for the Tapoco project in 2005. The relicensing process is well underway for the Yadkin hydroelectric project license that is up for renewal in 2008. In May 2007, APGI filed with FERC a Relicensing Settlement Agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues. The National Environmental Policy Act process is underway, with a draft environmental impact statement having been issued in September 2007. This process is expected to be completed during 2008, with a new project license issued shortly thereafter. With the Badin smelter idled, power generated from APGIs Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and then sold into the wholesale market.
In the Pacific Northwest, Alcoa has a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) located in the State of Washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the Wenatchee smelter through October 2011. In December 2007, the Chelan PUD Commissioners approved the terms of an agreement under which Alcoa and Chelan PUD would enter into a new contract beginning in November 2011 and running through October 2028 under which Alcoa would receive approximately 25% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUDs Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. Definitive agreements are expected to be finalized in the course of the year. In addition, Alcoa has a 10 Table of Contents contract through September 2011 with the Bonneville Power Administration under which Alcoa is receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the Intalco smelter.
The company, through APGI, generates substantially all of the power used at its Warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves. In May 2005, Alcoa acquired mining rights to the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves and subsequently hired Vigo Coal Company, Inc to manage and operate the mine. The mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year, 45% of the Warrick power plants requirements. The balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local Illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration. In April 2001, under the terms of an operating agreement, the company assumed from Vectren (formerly Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company) operation of the power plant that supplies the Warrick smelter. In July 2005, Alcoa announced its plans to invest approximately $525 million at the Warrick power plant to improve environmental performance and operational efficiency, as well as to lower costs. This project is well underway.
Power for the Rockdale smelter was historically generated by company-owned generating units and TXU Generation Company LP (TXU)-owned generating units, both of which used lignite supplied by the companys Sandow Mine. Upon completion of lignite mining in the Sandow Mine in 2005, lignite supply transitioned to the company-owned Three Oaks Mine. The company retired its three wholly-owned generating units in late 2006, and transitioned to an arrangement under which TXU supplies all of the Rockdale smelters electricity requirements under a long-term power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038, with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price. In August 2007, TXU and Alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which TXU will construct, own and operate a new circulating fluidized bed power plant adjacent to the existing Sandow Unit Four Power Plant, and in September 2007, on the sale of the Three Oaks Mine to TXU.
In the northeast, the purchased power contracts for both the Massena East and Massena West smelters in New York expire not earlier than June30, 2013, following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon New York Power Authority (NYPA) having relicensed its St. Lawrence-FDR Hydro Project. In December 2007, Alcoa and NYPA reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the Massena East and Massena West smelters for 30 years, beginning on July1, 2013. Work on a definitive agreement is underway.
The Deschambault and Bcancour smelters in Quebec purchase electricity under long-term contracts with Hydro-Quebec that expire in 2014, subject to extension provisions. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Quebec purchases approximately 65% of its power needs under the Hydro-Quebec contract and receives the remainder from a 40%-owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Company.
The Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina purchases electricity from Santee Cooper under a contract that expires December31, 2015, subject to certain extension provisions.
At the end of 2005, all production was temporarily curtailed at the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland. The curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelters power contract on December31, 2005, as a competitively-priced replacement power supply could not be obtained. Alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power source for Eastalco.
Australia  Electricity Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by AofA, and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for the companys smelter in Point Henry, Victoria. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively.
Brazil  Electricity The Alumar smelter is supplied by Eletronorte (Centrais Eltricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.) through a long-term power purchase agreement expiring in June 2024. Eletronorte has supplied the Alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984.
11 Table of Contents Aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil, which began to generate power at full capacity in 2002. Aluminio receives its share of the plants output, which is sufficient to cover 55% of its operating needs at the Poos de Caldas smelter. In January 2007, Aluminio exercised pre-emptive rights to acquire an additional ownership interest of 4.67% in Machadinho. This additional investment provides an additional 15 megawatts of assured energy. This transaction was approved by the Brazilian Energy Agency, antitrust regulators, and other third parties. In September 2007, Aluminios ownership interest of 31.89% was reduced by 0.9% due to the admission of a new investor to the Machadinho consortium.
Aluminio also has a 42.18% interest in Energtica Barra Grande S.A.  BAESA, which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. Barra Grande began operating in November 2005, and reached full generating capacity in 2006. Aluminios share of the project covers a substantial portion of its remaining needs at the Poos de Caldas smelter.
With Machadinho and Barra Grande, Aluminios current power self-sufficiency is approximately 40%, to meet a total energy demand of approximately 690 megawatts from Brazilian primary plants.
Aluminio is also participating in a number of other Brazilian hydropower projects. Two of these projects have received the Environmental Installation License from the Federal Government and started construction in 2007:  Estreito , northern Brazil  Aluminios share is 25.49%  Serra do Faco , in the southeast of Brazil  Aluminios share is 34.97% Serra do Faco and Estreito generation of power is expected to begin in 2010.
A third project, Pai Quer in southern Brazil (Aluminio share is 35.00%), is still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses.
If these projects are completed, the power will be used in Aluminios smelters or sold into the Brazilian grid.
In December 2007, Aluminio concluded the sale of its 42% participation in ETAU, a Brazilian company that holds and operates an electric transmission line in southern Brazil.
Europe  Electricity The company purchases electricity for its smelters at Portovesme and Fusina, Italy in the recently deregulated market, under contracts expiring in December 2009 for both locations. A new law went into effect on May14, 2005, that extends through December 2010 the special tariff conditions applicable to the Italian smelters. That measure provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the Italian Government. However, in July 2006 the European Union (EU) opened an ongoing investigation into whether this provision should be considered unlawful state aid, which may not be compatible with European legislation. It is Alcoas understanding that the Italian Governments continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations. While Alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the decision of the EU Commission (EC) on this matter, it is possible that the EC could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to January 2006. A decision by the EC is not expected until late in 2008. On November29, 2006, Alcoa filed an appeal before the European Court of First Instance seeking the annulment of the decision of the EC to open the investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules. This appeal, which may be withdrawn by Alcoa at any time, is expected to be resolved late in 2008, as well.
The companys smelters at San Ciprin, La Corua and Avils, Spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in January 2009. On January25, 2007, the EC announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with EU state aid rules. Alcoa has been operating in Spain for more than nine years under a power supply 12 Table of Contents structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983. The investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energy-intensive consumers and the distribution companies. It is Alcoas understanding that the Spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system. A decision by the EC is not expected until late 2008. If the ECs investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful, Alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the EU courts.
Iceland  Electricity As noted above, Alcoas new Fjaral smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a 40-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, built the Krahnjkar dam and power project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. First power was supplied to the Fjaral smelter in April 2007, and with the completion of the Krahnjkar project in late 2007, the smelter is now ramping up to full production, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008.
Minority Interests  Electricity The smelters in Ghana, Norway and Venezuela, in which Alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager, have made a variety of electricity purchase arrangements, through their respective managing or majority partners. Power for the smelter in Ghana is provided under an interim power rate agreement with the Volta River Authority. The other contracts are up for renewal at various times, the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020.
Canada& U.S.  Natural Gas In order to supply its refineries and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoas larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.
Australia  Natural Gas AofA holds a 20% equity interest in a consortium that bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to Alcoas alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries.

Joint Ventures and Investments The companys principal alliances and joint ventures are included in its upstream operating segments (alumina and primary metals) as shown in the tables above relating to those segments.
14 Table of Contents Alcoas other significant joint ventures and investments are as follows: Alcoa Bohai Aluminum Industries Company Limited.
In October 2005, Alcoa inaugurated a restructured joint venture with China International Trust & Investment (CITIC), its equity partner, to produce aluminum rolled products in Qinghuangdao, China. Alcoa is the managing partner in the new venture, holding a 73% stake, with CITIC holding a 27% stake. The joint venture operates existing aluminum cold rolling and foil facilities and is undertaking a major expansion, which includes a hot rolling mill and related equipment. The expansion is expected to start at 40,000 tons in 2008 and reach full capacity of 150,000 tons in 2010.
Alcoa Kunshan Aluminum Products Company Ltd.
In September 2006, Alcoa completed the acquisition of its 70% interest in the aluminum brazing sheet venture in Kunshan City, China. Alcoa is the managing partner in the venture, with the remaining 30% shares held by Shanxi Yuncheng Engraving Group. Kunshan Aluminum is designed to produce 50,000 mtpy of aluminum brazing sheet primarily for the Asian automotive market. It is the third flat-rolled products facility managed by Alcoa in China including those owned and operated by Alcoa Bohai Aluminum Industries Company Limited and Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Limited.
Elkem Aluminium ANS.
This Norwegian partnership is owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Elkem AS, one of Norways largest industrial companies and a leading supplier of metals and materials, with Elkem as managing partner. The partnership is the second largest aluminum producer in Norway and operates two smelters: Mosjen and Lista. These facilities supply extrusion billets, rolling ingots and foundry ingots to leading rolling mills, extrusion plants and foundries in Europe.
In 2007, Alcoa formed or sold the following joint ventures and investments: Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco).
In November 2001, Alcoa entered into a strategic alliance with Chalco and its parent company, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco). Under this alliance, in 2001 Alcoa became a strategic investor in Chalcos global offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Chinalco is the largest shareholder in Chalco and Alcoa was the largest holder of the shares of Chalco listed on stock exchanges outside China. In September 2007, Alcoa disposed of its interest in Chalco through a placement of the shares.
Orkla ASA (Orkla) and SAPA AB (Sapa).
In 2006, Alcoa and Orkla signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture with Orklas subsidiary Sapa, to be majority owned and operated by Sapa, to combine Alcoas soft alloy extrusion business with Sapas extruded aluminum business. Alcoas soft alloy extrusion business then operated 22 facilities in eight countries; Sapas profiles business consisted of 18 facilities in 12 countries. This transaction was completed in the second quarter of 2007. Alcoa will continue to own and operate its hard alloy extrusion business which serves the aerospace, automotive, and selected other markets.
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks The company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The companys rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoas business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark.
The company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.
The company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer level, and others that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include 15 Table of Contents Alcoa and the Alcoa Symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck  fasteners, Kawneer building panels and Dura-Bright  surface treatments. Presto  storage bags, Cut-Rite  wax paper, Baco  household wraps, Reynolds  plastic wrap and Reynolds Wrap  aluminum foil are expected to be assigned to Rank Group Limited upon completion of its purchase of Alcoas packaging and consumer business. The companys rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.
Competitive Conditions Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and nonaluminum businesses. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoas markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials  such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications; steel, plastics and glass for packaging applications  aluminums diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability and flexibility, are also significant factors. For Alcoas segments that market products under Alcoas brand names, brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role.
Research and Development Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Expenditures for R&D activities were $249 million in 2007, $213 million in 2006 and $192 million in 2005.
Most of the major process areas within the company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area, developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Certain business units alternatively conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center. Technical personnel from the TMRBs, the Technical Center and such business units also participate in the corresponding Market Sector Lead Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.
During 2007, the company continued work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. In Primary Metals, progress was made on inert anode technology. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies, although there remain technical and cost targets to achieve. Technical targets include optimization of pot operating conditions and maintenance of metal purity. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the company believes that it would be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology, resulting in significant operating cost savings. The new technology would also generate environmental benefits by reducing and eliminating certain emissions, especially carbon dioxide. No timetable has been established for commercial use. Progress was also made on carbothermic projects, which if commercially feasible may reduce capital and energy costs, as well as provide environmental benefits related to waste reduction.
In the semi-fabrication businesses, new alloys including Aluminum-Lithium (Al Li) and a very high strength alloy were developed and applied to aerospace products. The combined Al Li alloy development and application was awarded the global R&D 100 award, given annually by R&D magazine to the worlds 100 most significant innovations, for its enabling ability to significantly reduce aircraft weight. In the manufacturing arena, the simultaneous multi-alloy casting process was developed with plans to commercialize it in 2008. The company has also moved from the research and development stage to pilot scale on its continuous cast-rolled products process. In addition, a number of low grade scrap use technologies were developed and implemented providing both cost and environmental benefits.
A number of products were commercialized in 2007 such as those included in the Dura Bright  wheels with XBR Technology brand and Reynobond  brand products co-branded with Kevlar  - brand products, unique surface sheet 16 Table of Contents for the consumer electronics market, lightweight armor applications for the defense market and high performance products for the oil and gas markets. For the aerospace market, new multi-material technologies have been developed to compete effectively with composites.
The company currently has at least 60 new products in various development stages. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world.
Environmental Matters Information relating to environmental matters is included in three areas of the Annual Report: under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Environmental Matters on pages 35 and 36, in Note A to the financial statements under the caption Environmental Expenditures on pages 50 through 54, and in Note Y to the financial statements beginning on page 77.
Employees Total worldwide employment at year-end 2007 was 107,000 employees in 44 countries. About 60,000 of these employees are represented by labor unions. The company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good.
In the United States, 14,000 employees are represented by various labor unions. The master collective bargaining agreement between Alcoa and the United Steelworkers covering 14 locations and approximately 9,000 United States employees is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2010. There are 43 other collective bargaining agreements in the United States with varying expiration dates. Various collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover about 23,000 employees in Europe, 9,000 employees in Mexico, 7,000 employees in South America, 4,000 employees in Australia and 3,000 employees in Canada.
Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Forward-Looking Statements This report and the portions of the Annual Report incorporated by reference herein contain (and oral communications made by Alcoa may contain) statements that relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, hopes, targets, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address Alcoas expectations or projections about the future, including statements about Alcoas strategy for growth, cost reduction goals, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on Alcoas estimates, assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Alcoa to be different from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, Alcoa cannot guarantee that these estimates, assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. Alcoa disclaims any intention or obligation (other than as required by law) to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Item1A.Risk Factors.
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in Managements Discussion and Analysis in the Annual Report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause Alcoas actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements: 17 Table of Contents Alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in LME prices, economic conditions generally, and aluminum end-use markets.
The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences. Prices can be volatile. Alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers, as well as forward, futures and options contracts, to manage its exposure to the volatility of LME-based prices as market conditions warrant from time to time, and is product and segment diversified. However, Alcoas results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by Alcoa, including the transportation, building and construction, distribution, packaging, industrial gas turbine and other markets.
Alcoas operations consume substantial amounts of energy; profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted.
Alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations. Although Alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, the following could affect Alcoas results of operations:  significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;  significant increases in natural gas prices;  unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts, hurricanes or other natural causes;  unavailability of energy due to energy shortages resulting in insufficient supplies to serve consumers;  interruptions in energy supply due to equipment failure or other causes; or  curtailment of one or more refineries or smelters due to inability to extend energy contracts upon expiration or negotiate new arrangements on cost-effective terms.
Alcoas profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials.
Alcoas results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, including caustic soda, calcined petroleum coke and resins, and freight costs associated with transporting raw materials to refining and smelting locations, in addition to energy. Alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.
Union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Alcoas financial results.
Some of Alcoas employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Alcoas facilities in the future. Alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy.
Alcoa has an organic growth strategy focused on its upstream businesses. Significant expansion or growth projects are in various stages of development or negotiation in several countries including Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Greenland, Guinea, Iceland, Jamaica and Trinidad. These projects may not be completed or may be completed at higher cost than expected due to shortages of labor or materials, inability to obtain energy sources at competitive rates, inability to negotiate favorable contracts, inability to finance the construction of projects at favorable rates of interest, currency fluctuations, political unrest, regulatory developments and commercial risks, including but not limited to adverse developments in the global supply and demand for alumina and aluminum.
18 Table of Contents As part of its strategy for growth, Alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met.
Alcoas operations are exposed to business and operational risks, changes in conditions and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates.
Alcoa has investments, activities and expansion projects in numerous countries outside the U.S. and in emerging markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, member countries of the European Union, Ghana, Greenland, Guinea, Iceland, India, Jamaica, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Suriname, and Vietnam. Changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which Alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and Alcoas results of operations.
Alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates.
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and competitive factors in the countries in which Alcoa operates, could affect its revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Euro and Australian dollar, may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies, while products generally are sold in U.S. dollars.
The influence of China may negatively impact our results in the event of a slowdown in consumption.
The Chinese market has become a significant source of global demand for commodities. China now represents in excess of 25percent of aluminum demand. Chinas demand for aluminum has more than doubled in the last five years. Consequently, in response to its increased demand for commodities, China is increasingly seeking self-sufficiency in key commodities, including investments in additional developments in other countries. These investments may impact future demand and supply balances and prices.
Alcoa faces significant price competition from other aluminum producers and end-use markets for certain Alcoa products that are highly competitive, such that customers may be willing to accept substitutes for products sold by Alcoa.
The markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive. In addition, aluminum competes with other materials, such as steel, plastics, composites, and glass, among others, for various applications in Alcoas key markets. See also Competitive Conditions above. The willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by Alcoa, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products, or other developments by or affecting Alcoas competitors or customers could affect Alcoas results of operations.
Further metals industry consolidation could impact our business.
The metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future. Although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted our business, further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict.
19 Table of Contents Alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers.
A significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by Alcoa could affect Alcoas results of operations in a particular period. Alcoas customers may experience delays in the launch of new products due to technical and design difficulties and if Alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers, profitability may be adversely affected.
Alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.
Alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance, including deployment of company-wide business process models, such as the Alcoa Business System and the Alcoa Enterprise Business Solution, an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across Alcoa for data, processes and supporting software. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.
Alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives.
Alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies, including inert anode and carbothermic technology, in addition to multi-alloy casting processes. There can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Alcoa.
Alcoa is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws.
Alcoas operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to several sites.
Climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.
Energy is a significant input in a number of Alcoas operations. There is growing recognition that energy consumption is a contributor to global warming, greenhouse effects and potentially climate change.
A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. There is also current and emerging regulation, such as the mandatory renewable energy target in Australia, or potential carbon trading regimes that will affect energy prices. Alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gas-intensive assets and energy-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates. These regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact Alcoas operations directly or indirectly through customers. Inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the companys assets. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which Alcoa operates.
The potential physical impacts of climate change on the companys operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of Alcoas operations.
20 Table of Contents Alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in law.
Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Alcoa, including product liability, safety and health and other claims.
Alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets.
Alcoas estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). Alcoas results of operations, liquidity or shareholders equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions.
Unexpected events may increase Alcoas cost of doing business or disrupt Alcoas operations.
Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters, war or terrorist activities, unplanned outages, supply disruptions, or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications, may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact Alcoas financial performance. Further, existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.
The above list of important factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.

23 Table of Contents Alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of properties owned by Alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report, the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties. See Notes H and N to the financial statements for information on properties, plants and equipment and lease expense.
Item3.Legal Proceedings.
In the ordinary course of its business, Alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. It is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies. Management believes, however, that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company.
Environmental Matters Alcoa is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA) or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites.
As previously reported, since 1989, Alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the Grasse River, adjacent to Alcoas Massena, New York plant site, under order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under Section106 of CERCLA. Sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). In early 2002, Alcoa submitted a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report to EPA. This Report identified potential remedial actions related to PCB contamination of the river, including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by EPA. It also reflected certain recent studies and investigations on the river, including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies. The range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 Report was between $2 million and $525 million. Alcoa believes that rational, scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or man-made processes. Because the selection of the $2 million alternative (natural recovery) was considered remote, the company adjusted the reserve for the Grasse River in 2002 to $30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives, as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others. In June 2003, based on then recent river observations, EPA requested that Alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered. The results of these additional studies, submitted in a report to EPA in April of 2004, suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios. Those evaluations were submitted to EPA along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river. In May 2004, EPA approved Alcoas proposed Remedial Options Pilot Study (ROPS) that includes sediment removal and capping, the installation of an ice control structure, and significant monitoring. At the same time, Alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the $35 million estimated cost of the ROPS, in addition to the $30 million previously reserved. Most of the construction work for the ROPS was completed in 2005 with monitoring proposed through 2008. The findings from the ROPS program and from these additional investigations will be incorporated into a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report that is expected to be submitted in 2008. EPA will use this information to develop a remedy for the river. With the exception of the natural recovery remedy, none of the existing alternatives in the 2002 Analysis of Alternatives Report is more probable than the others and the results of the ROPS are necessary to revise the scope and estimated cost of many of the current alternatives. EPAs ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability. Alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time EPAs Record of Decision is issued, which is expected in 2009 or later.
24 Table of Contents As previously reported, representatives of various U.S. federal and state agencies and a Native American tribe, acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources, have asserted that Alcoa and Reynolds Metals Company (Reynolds) may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on Alcoas and Reynolds operations at their Massena, New York and St. Lawrence, New York facilities. While formal proceedings have not been instituted, the company continues to actively investigate these claims. The company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, in September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck the U.S. Virgin Islands, including the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. facility on the island of St. Croix. The wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas. Various clean-up and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on behalf of St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. A Notice of Violation was issued by the Division of Environmental Protection of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources of the Virgin Islands Government, and has been contested by the company. A civil suit was commenced in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands by certain residents of St. Croix in February 1999 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries and property damages associated with bauxite or red dust from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. facility. The suit, which has been removed to the District Court of the Virgin Islands, names St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C., Alcoa Inc. and Glencore Ltd. as defendants, and in August 2000 was accorded class action treatment. The class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who suffered damages and/or injuries as a result of exposure during and after Hurricane Georges to red dust and red mud blown during Hurricane Georges. All of the defendants have denied liability, and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since 1999. In October 2003, the defendants received plaintiffs expert reports. These reports also claim that the material blown during Hurricane Georges consisted of bauxite and red mud, and contained crystalline silica, chromium and other substances. The reports go on to claim, among other things, that the population of the six subject neighborhoods as of the 2000 census (a total of 3,730 people) has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants, and hence will be able to show entitlement to lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and punitive relief. These opinions have been contested by the defendants expert reports, that state, among other things, that plaintiffs were not exposed to the substances alleged and that in any event the level of alleged exposure does not justify lifetime medical monitoring. In August 2005, Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. moved to decertify the plaintiff class, and in March 2006, the assigned magistrate judge issued a recommendation that class certification be maintained for liability issues only, and that the class be decertified after liability issues have been resolved. This recommendation has been adopted by the assigned district judge. Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. have turned over this matter to their insurance carriers who are providing a defense. Glencore Ltd. is jointly defending the case with Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. and has a pending motion to dismiss. The company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, on September26, 2003, EPA Region VI filed an Administrative Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against the Wichita Falls, Texas facility of Howmet Corporation (Howmet) for violations of hazardous waste regulations relating to shipments of used potassium hydroxide to a fertilizer manufacturer from 1997 until 2000. The Complaint proposes a penalty of $265,128. In addition, EPA ordered Howmet to cease sending used potassium hydroxide to fertilizer manufacturers or employing used potassium hydroxide in any use constituting disposal and to certify compliance with hazardous waste regulations within 30 days. On October22, 2003, EPA Region II issued an almost identical Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against Howmets Dover, New Jersey facility, seeking $180,021 in penalties. Howmet filed its Answers to EPA Region VIs and EPA Region IIs Complaints. Howmets Answers denied the substance of EPAs Complaints, requested that no penalties be imposed and requested Hearings on both the hazardous waste allegations and the Compliance Orders. On April25, 2005, the administrative Court granted EPAs motions for partial accelerated decision with respect to both cases, finding that Howmet violated the cited regulatory provisions alleged in the Complaint and moved the case to the penalty phase. The Court rejected Howmets interlocutory appeal of this decision on May16, 2005. On September2, 2005, EPA and Howmet stipulated to a penalty amount of $309,091 for the consolidated matters should the finding of liability be upheld and Howmet appealed the administrative Courts decision to the Environmental Appeals Board on September28, 2005. On May24, 2007, the Environmental Appeals Board upheld the administrative Courts liability 25 Table of Contents finding against Howmet and assessed the parties stipulated penalty of $309,091. On July23, 2007, Howmet appealed the Environmental Appeals Board decision to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
As previously reported, in May 2005 , Alcoa World Alumina LLC and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. were among the defendants listed in a lawsuit brought by the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources, Dean Plaskett, in his capacity as Trustee for Natural Resources of the Territory of the United States Virgin Islands in the District Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. The complaint seeks damages for alleged injuries to natural resources caused by alleged releases from an alumina refinery facility in St. Croix that was owned by St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. from 1995 to 2002. Also listed in the lawsuit are previous and subsequent owners of the alumina refinery and the owners of an adjacent oil refinery. Claims are brought under CERCLA, U.S. Virgin Islands law, and common law. The plaintiff has not specified in the complaint the amount it seeks in damages. The defendants have filed motions to dismiss and, in September 2006, filed a motion for an order staying discovery pending resolution of those motions. All of these motions are pending and discovery has not begun. In September 2007, the court asked the parties to brief the issue of whether the natural resource provisions of the federal Superfund law preempted territorial statutory and common law claims in the case. The parties have complied. In October 2007, the plaintiff and St. Croix Renaissance Group, L.L.L.P. (SCRG) filed a joint Agreement and Consent Decree to resolve SCRGs liability in the lawsuit, along with any CERCLA liability it may have with respect to the facility. The remaining defendants each filed objections to the Agreement and Consent Decree. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, in August 2005, Dany Lavoie, a resident of Baie Comeau in the Canadian Province of Quebec, filed a Motion for Authorization to Institute a Class Action and for Designation of a Class Representative against Alcoa Canada Inc., Alcoa Limitee, Societe Canadienne de Metaux Reynolds Limitee and Canadian British Aluminum in the Superior Court of Quebec in the District of Baie Comeau. Plaintiff seeks to institute the class action on behalf of a putative class consisting of all past, present and future owners, tenants and residents of Baie Comeaus St. Georges neighborhood. He alleges that defendants, as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in Baie Comeau, have negligently allowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter, specifically Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons or PAHs, that have been deposited on the lands and houses of the St. Georges neighborhood and its environs causing damage to the property of the putative class and causing health concerns for those who inhabit that neighborhood. If allowed to proceed as a class action, plaintiff seeks to compel additional remediation to be conducted by the defendants beyond that already undertaken by them voluntarily, seeks an injunction against further emissions in excess of a limit to be determined by the court in consultation with an independent expert, and seeks money damages on behalf of all class members. A hearing on plaintiffs motion for class certification was held on April24-26, 2007. On May23, 2007, the court issued its ruling which granted the motion in part and authorized a class action suit to include only people who suffered property damage or personal injury damages caused by the emission of PAHs from the smelter. On September13, 2007, the plaintiff filed its claim against the original defendants, which the court had authorized in May. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, on December5, 2005, Alcoa received service of a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and styled as Margaret George, et al., v. General Motors Corporation and Alcoa Inc., Docket No.05-CV-1482. The complaint alleges personal injury and damages arising from exposure to PCB released from the defendants industrial facilities in Massena, New York and seeks certification of a class of plaintiffs comprised of individual Mohawk Indians residing on the Akwesane Territory, a Mohawk Indian Reservation, situated along the St. Lawrence River in the United States and Canada. The suit alleges that approximately 12,000 individuals reside on the reservation. The company is investigating the allegations and has filed an answer denying liability. The defendants substantial defenses to liability have now become evident to plantiffs, facilitating settlement negotiations based on cost of defense valuations. A settlement is likely and an appropriate reserve has been established.
As previously reported, in January 2006, in Musgrave v. Alcoa, et al, Warrick Circuit Court, County of Warrick, Indiana; 87-C01-0601-CT-0006, Alcoa Inc. and a subsidiary were sued by an individual, on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated, claiming harm from alleged exposure to waste that had been disposed in designated pits at 26 Table of Contents the Squaw Creek Mine in the 1970s. During February 2007, class allegations were dropped and the matter now proceeds as an individual claim.
Also as previously reported, in October 2006, in Barnett, et al. v. Alcoa and Alcoa Fuels, Inc., Warrick Circuit Court, County of Warrick, Indiana; 87C01-0601-PL-499, forty-one plaintiffs sued Alcoa Inc. and a subsidiary, asserting claims similar to the Musgrave matter, discussed above. On November19, 2007, Alcoa Inc. and its subsidiary filed motions to dismiss both the Musgrave and Barnett cases. The Musgrave and Barnett matters are in their preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, on April5, 2006, Alcoa was notified by the Court of Venice (Tribunal di Venezia) that Alcoa Trasformazioni S.r.l., Fusina site (Venice), was sued by the Italian Minister of Environment and Minister of Public Works for an alleged liability for environmental damages. The plaintiffs asserted that Alcoa, as present owner of the site contaminated by previous activities, had the duty to act promptly to prevent the site from contaminating the Venice Lagoon and its surrounding natural resources. Alcoa Trasformazioni denies responsibility for the pre-existing condition and for failing to eliminate or circumscribe the pollution which was already the object of initiatives by the public authorities and a clear duty of the previous owner and plant seller. Alcoa has sued Alumix and Efim (the sellers of the Fusina site) before the Court of Rome for indemnification against any liability related to the pollution of former Alumix sites, purchased by Alcoa in 1996. Plaintiffs seek compensation for damages to the environment plus costs of installing a physical barrier along the plants border with the Lagoon. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, in December2006, St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. was sued by the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR), U.S. Virgin Islands, in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. The plaintiff alleges violations of the Coastal Zone Management Act and a construction permit issued thereunder. The complaint seeks a civil fine of $10,000 under the Coastal Zone Management Act, civil penalties of $10,000 per day for alleged intentional and knowing violations of the Coastal Zone Management Act, exemplary damages, costs, interest and attorneys fees, and other such amounts as may be just and proper. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, in December 2006, St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (SCA), along with unaffiliated prior and subsequent owners, were sued by the Commissioner of the DPNR, U.S. Virgin Islands, in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. This second suit alleges violations by the defendants of certain permits and environmental statutes said to apply to the facility. The complaint seeks the completion of certain actions regarding the facility, a civil fine from each defendant of $10,000 under the Coastal Zone Management Act, civil penalties of $50,000 per day for each alleged violation of the Water Pollution Control Act, $10,000 per day for alleged intentional and knowing violations of the Coastal Zone Management Act, exemplary damages, costs, interest and attorneys fees, and other such amounts as may be just and proper. In October 2007, Plaintiff and defendant SCRG entered into a settlement agreement resolving claims against SCRG. Plaintiff filed a notice of dismissal with the court, and the court entered an order dismissing SCRG on November2, 2007. SCA objected to the dismissal and requested that the court withdraw its order, and the parties have briefed SCAs objection and request. A decision from the court is pending. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
As previously reported, on January22, 2007, the City of Point Comfort, Texas filed suit against Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Victoria Division. Served on January31, 2007, the suit alleges that air emissions from AWAs Point Comfort facility have caused personal injury and property damage to the city and its residents. The complaint seeks injunctions prohibiting operation and unspecified damages. The parties are currently engaged in settlement discussions. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.
27 Table of Contents Other Matters As previously reported, along with various asbestos manufacturers and distributors, Alcoa and its subsidiaries as premises owners are defendants in several hundred active lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos at various company facilities. In addition, an Alcoa subsidiary company has been named, along with a large common group of industrial companies, in a pattern complaint where the companys involvement is not evident. Since 1999, several thousand such complaints have been filed. To date, the subsidiary has been dismissed from almost every case that was actually placed in line for trial. Alcoa, its subsidiaries and acquired companies, all have had numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims. Many of these policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations. Alcoa believes that between its reserves and insurance it is adequately covered for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the financial condition of the company.
As previously reported, during the first quarter of 2005, in the context of an informal investigation being conducted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to certain trade payables financing, the company received a request for the voluntary provision of documents and related information concerning the classification and disclosure of certain trade accounts payable transactions for periods beginning after December31, 2002 that involve, directly or indirectly, an intermediary. The SEC staff has advised the company that the inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred, or as an adverse reflection upon any person or security. During the second quarter of 2005, Alcoa completed its production of documents and information in response to the SECs request. The company has had no further contact from the SEC since that time. Accordingly, the company now considers this matter closed.
As previously reported, in the 2006 second quarter, Alcoa Aluminio S.A. (Alcoa Aluminio) received a Notice of Violation and Fine from Brazils Federal Revenue Department seeking payment of an isolated fine for alleged non-anticipation of payment of annual Corporate Income (CI) and Social Contribution Taxes (SCT), calculated under the presumed monthly taxable income mechanism. The claim was based on Alcoa Aluminio not qualifying for the alternative method of anticipation of payment of CI and SCT used by the company, consisting of calculating such anticipations based on the actual taxable income mechanism, in accordance with applicable legislation. The claim sought payment of Brazilian real $669 million and encompassed fiscal years from 2000 to 2005. On September4, 2006, a favorable first administrative level decision was rendered finding the claim against Alcoa Aluminio to be without merit. On September12, 2007, a favorable second administrative level decision was rendered finding the claim against Alcoa Aluminio to be without merit. In early January 2008, the Federal Revenue Department informed Alcoa that the claim against Alcoa has been fully cancelled. Accordingly, the company now considers this matter closed.
As previously reported, on July20, 2006, the European Commission (EC) announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff granted by Italy to some energy intensive industries complies with European Union state aid rules. The new Italian power tariff modifies the preferential tariff that was in force until December31, 2005 and extends it through 2010. Alcoa has been operating in Italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the EC in 1996. That measure, like the new one, was based on Italian state legislation that provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the Italian Government. The ECs announcement states that it has doubts about the measures compatibility with European Union legislation and concerns about distortion of competition in the European market of primary aluminum, where energy is an important part of the production costs. The opening of an in-depth investigation gives interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures. It does not prejudge the outcome of the procedure. It is Alcoas understanding that the Italian Governments continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations. Alcoa believes that the total potential impact from a loss of the tariff would be approximately $20 million (pre-tax) per month in higher power costs at its Italian smelters. The estimated total potential impact has increased since 2006 due predominantly to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, as the liability would be payable in Euros in the event of a negative outcome. While Alcoa believes that any additional 28 Table of Contents cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the ECs decision on this matter, it is possible that the EC could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to January 2006. If the ECs investigation concludes that extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff is unlawful, Alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg in November of 2006 in response to the investigation.
As previously reported, on November17, 2006, in Curtis v. Alcoa Inc., Civil Action No.3:06cv448 (E.D. Tenn.), a class action was filed by plaintiffs representing approximately 13,000 retired former employees of Alcoa or Reynolds Metals Company and spouses and dependents of such retirees alleging violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Labor-Management Relations Act by requiring plaintiffs, beginning January1, 2007, to pay health insurance premiums and increased co-payments and co-insurance for certain medical procedures and prescription drugs. Plaintiffs allege these changes to their retiree health care plans violate their rights to vested health care benefits. Plaintiffs additionally allege that Alcoa has breached its fiduciary duty to plaintiffs under ERISA by misrepresenting to them that their health benefits would never change. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, back payment of benefits and attorneys fees. Alcoa has consented to treatment of plaintiffs claims as a class action. During the fourth quarter, following briefing and argument, the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction with trial, certified a plaintiff class, bifurcated and stayed the plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claims, struck the plaintiffs jury demand, but indicated it would use an advisory jury, and set a trial date of September17, 2008. Alcoa estimates that, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, the maximum exposure would be an additional postretirement benefit liability of approximately $300 million and approximately $40 million (includes an interest cost component) of expense annually, on average, for the next 11 years. Alcoa believes that it has valid defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously. However, as this litigation is in its preliminary stages, the company is unable to predict the outcome.
As previously reported, on January25, 2007, the EC announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with EU state aid rules. Alcoa has been operating in Spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983. The investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energy-intensive consumers and the distribution companies. The investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the EC. With respect to the energy-intensive consumers, the EC is opening the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than the pool price mechanism, therefore being, in principle, artificially below market conditions. Alcoa has submitted comments in which the company has provided evidence that prices paid by energy-intensive consumers were in line with the market, in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the Spanish tariff system. Therefore, it is Alcoas understanding that the Spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system. While Alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005, it is possible that the EC could extend its investigation to later years. Alcoa believes that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision would be approximately $11 million (pre-tax) for 2005. If the ECs investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful, Alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the EU courts.
Item4.Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

4 The Alcoa Fee Continuation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, adopted in 1990, provided fee continuation payments for persons who met a minimum service requirement as a non-employee director. Each of the eligible participants (ten at December31, 2007) was entitled to receive such cash and stock payments for life upon retirement from the Board based upon the cash retainer fee for directors and an annual stock grant under the companys former Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. In 1995, the Board froze future annual payments to eligible directors at a maximum of $30,000 and 2,000 shares (or a lesser proportion based on service). In 2006, the Plan was amended to provide that all payments would be made in cash rather than stock and cash, at the equivalent value of the payments the eligible participants would have received in stock and cash. Prior to the 2006 Amendment, Alcoas practice had been to use treasury shares for the share payments. All current fees and other compensation for directors are outlined under the caption Director Compensation of the Proxy Statement.
