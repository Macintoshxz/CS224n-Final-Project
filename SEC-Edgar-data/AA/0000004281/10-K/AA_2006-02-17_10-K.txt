3 Table of Contents Structure of Certain Operations The companys Alumina and Chemicals segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Generally, Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited (formerly WMC Limited) owns 40% of these entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos.10(a) through 10(e) to this report.
Alcoa Aluminio S.A. (Aluminio), an integrated aluminum producer in Brazil, is a subsidiary of Alcoa. Aluminio operates mining, refining, smelting and fabricated products facilities at various locations in Brazil. In 2003, Alcoa acquired the 40.9% shareholding in Aluminio held by affiliates of Camargo Correa S.A. (collectively the Camargo Group). Prior to the acquisition, Alcoa had owned approximately 59% of Aluminio and the Camargo Group had been the principal minority shareholder since 1984. For more information on this acquisition, see Note F to the financial statements.
Bauxite Interests Aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earths crust. Aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The company obtains bauxite from reserves held by AWAC, from the companys interests in Brazil, and under both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2003, Alcoa consumed 30.8 million metric tons (mt) of bauxite from its own reserves, 6.9 million mt from related third parties and 1.9 million mt from unrelated third parties. Alcoas present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future. The following table provides information regarding the companys bauxite interests: Alcoa Active 1 Bauxite Interests Country Project Mining Rights (% Entitlement ) Expiration Date of Mining Rights Australia DarlingRangeMines Alcoa of Australia Limited (AofA) 2 (100%) 2045 Brazil Poos de Caldas Aluminio (100%) 2017 3 Guinea Bke Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea (CBG) 4 (100%) 2038 5 Jamaica Clarendon/Manchester Plateau Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica, L.L.C.

Aluminio holds an 8.6% interest, Abalco S.A. (Abalco) holds a 4.6% interest and Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) holds a 5% interest in Minerao Rio do Norte S.A. (MRN), a mining company jointly owned with affiliates of Alcan Inc. (Alcan), Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. MRN owns the Trombetas bauxite-mining project in Brazil. Aluminio and Abalco purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts. AWA LLC has agreed to purchase bauxite from the Trombetas project through 2019.
2 AofA is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa International Holdings Company and 40% by Alumina Limited.
4 Table of Contents 3 Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining concessions. The concession remains in force until the complete exhaustion of the deposit. Based on proven bauxite reserves and the currently anticipated needs of the Poos de Caldas alumina refinery, Aluminio estimates that the concessions will last at least until 2017. Depending, however, on the refinerys actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are explored and government approval, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.
4 AWA LLC owns a 43% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 51% and the Guinean government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in a 10,000 square-mile area in northwestern Guinea.
5 Alcoa has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that will provide Alcoa with bauxite through 2011.
6 This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and therefore is controlled by Alcoa.
7 Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the government of Jamaica.
8 This mining lease will be extended to a 40-year term and a new 40-year special mining lease will be granted, subject to the operational completion of the Jamalco alumina refinery expansion referred to in footnote 6 to the Alumina Refining Capacity table below.
9 While mining rights extend until 2033, bauxite reserves proven to date extend until 2023.

5 Table of Contents 5 The named company or an affiliate holds this interest.
6 In November 2003, Alcoa completed construction of the 250,000 mt expansion of its Jamalco alumina refinery in Clarendon. The expansion was part of an agreement to invest $115 million to expand the refinery and remove the nearly 30-year-old levy on bauxite from Jamalco. Once fully operational, the facilitys nameplate capacity will increase to 1,250,000 mtpy.
In January 2003, Alcoa and BHP Billiton signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the government of Suriname providing for (i) continuation and expansion of mining and refining activities in eastern Suriname and (ii) various exploration and other activities over the next two years relating to the feasibility of bauxite and alumina investments in western Suriname. Under the MOU, Alcoa and BHP Billiton have exclusive rights in western Suriname and have committed to spend up to $8.5 million over 21-25 months to explore this opportunity, shared 55% (Alcoa) and 45% (BHP Billiton). The MOU provides that Alcoa and BHP Billiton will negotiate an investment agreement with the Suriname government within 18 months.
In 2003, Alcoa broke ground on its previously announced capacity expansion at its Paranam alumina refinery in Suriname by 250,000 mt per year, an increase of approximately 13% that will bring its total capacity to approximately 2.2 million mt per year. The expansion is expected to be completed by July 2005. Alcoa and BHP Billiton have also signed an agreement extending the terms of their existing joint venture agreement on bauxite mining and alumina refining in eastern Suriname to 2025.

2 In 2003, the smelter was idle due to a power shortage. In 2004, Alcoa received notice that Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation executed an MOU to sell its 90% interest in the facility to the Government of the Republic of Ghana.
3 In 2003, Elkem completed its potline expansion that increased the plant capacity to 185,000 mtpy.
In February 2004, Alcoa announced that it had sold its 10 percent stake in the Alscon smelter in Ikot Abasi, Nigeria to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The registration of the change in control of the shares is still pending. The Alscon smelter was 70 percent owned by the Federal Government and 20 percent held by Ferrostaal AG. Only a portion of the facility has ever been operated and has been idle since mid-1999. The Bureau of Public Enterprise, an agency of the Nigerian government, is working to privatize Alscon. In connection with the sale, the company also terminated its entitlement to purchase all aluminum produced at the smelter for export.
In 2003, Alcoa finalized agreements with the Government of Iceland and Landsvirkjun, Icelands National Power Company, to build the 322,000 mt per year, Fjardal aluminum facility in eastern Iceland. Alcoa chose Bechtel Group, Inc. and its partner, HRV, an Icelandic engineering consortium, to design and build this new plant. It is scheduled to begin production in 2007, with construction of the plant to begin in 2005.
Alcoa also will explore the aluminum smelting and associated hydroelectric power opportunities in western Suriname. In January 2003, Alcoa signed an MOU with the government of Suriname providing for an 18-month exclusive period of investigation of the feasibility of smelting and associated hydroelectric power investment in western Suriname. Under the MOU Alcoa has budgeted $1.5 million - $7.5 million in expenditures over this period to assess the investment potential and to negotiate an investment agreement with the government.
The MOU with the Quebec government under which Alcoa planned to invest C$1 billion over eight years for the expansion and upgrade of its Baie Comeau, Quebec aluminum smelter expired by its terms on December 31, 2003 for failure of the parties to execute definitive agreements. The parties have agreed to extend the deadline until February 29, 2004.
In September 2003, Alcoa signed an MOU with the government of the Kingdom of Bahrain permitting Alcoa to acquire up to a 26% equity stake in Alba, a Bahrain company that owns and operates a 512,000 mtpy aluminum smelter. The MOU also addresses a long-term alumina supply arrangement for the Alba smelter.
Energy Alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power. Electric power accounts for approximately 25% of the companys primary aluminum costs. Alcoa generates 8 Table of Contents approximately 25% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and material long-term power arrangements for Alcoas smelters.
North America - Electricity For its 13 North American smelters, the company (largely through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI)) generates approximately 25% of the power requirements, and generally purchases the remainder under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates two hydroelectric projects consisting of eight dams under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licenses, which are up for renewal in 2005 and 2008.
In the Pacific Northwest, Alcoa obtains approximately half of its power needs for its Wenatchee smelter under a contract through 2011 with Chelan County Public Utility District located in the State of Washington. In addition, Alcoa has a contract through 2006 with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) that serves part of the Wenatchee smelter, as well as the Intalco smelter. Alcoa is currently returning part of its allotment of power to BPA under arrangements that end in September 2006.
The company, through APGI, generates substantially all of the power used at its Warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves. A 1996 coal supply contract satisfies up to 70% of the smelters fuel requirements through 2006. Annual contracts satisfy the remainder of the fuel requirements. In April 2001, under the terms of an operating agreement, the company assumed operation of the power plants that supply the Warrick smelter from Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company until at least 2008.
The Rockdale smelter uses lignite supplied by the companys Sandow Mine to generate power. The company has received all necessary permits to open a new lignite mine, the Three Oaks Mine, on land it owns or controls adjacent to its existing Sandow Mine. Company-owned generating units supply about one-half of the total electricity requirements of the smelter. TXU Energy supplies the balance through a long-term power contract that does not expire until at least 2038, with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price.
APGI hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at Alcoa, Tennessee and Badin, North Carolina. The Tennessee smelter also purchases power from the Tennessee Valley Authority under a contract that extends to 2010. With the Badin smelter idled, power generated from APGIs Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing, Inc.
In the Northeast, the purchased power contracts for the Massena and St. Lawrence, New York smelters expire not earlier than June 30, 2013, following their extension for 10 years upon New York Power Authority having relicensed one of its hydroelectric projects. The company, however, may terminate either of these contracts with one years notice.
The Deschambault and Bcancour smelters located in Quebec purchase electricity under long-term contracts with Hydro-Quebec that expire in 2014, subject to extension provisions. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Quebec purchases approximately 65% of its power needs under a long-term contract with Hydro-Quebec that expires in 2014 and receives the rest of its power needs from a 40%-owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Company.
The Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland and the Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina purchase electricity under contracts that expire December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2015, respectively, subject to certain extension provisions.
9 Table of Contents Australia - Electricity Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by AofA, and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for the companys smelter in Point Henry, Victoria. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively.
Brazil - Electricity The Alumar smelter has an agreement through 2004 to purchase electric power from Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil S.A. Eletronorte, a government controlled electric utility. Renewal negotiations have begun. Aluminio had a purchase agreement with Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. that ended in December 2002 to supply energy to its Poos de Caldas smelter. It is now purchasing 49% of its power requirements under two power supply agreements with Chesf and Furnas, state controlled electric utilities. Agreements extend to December 2004 and 2006, respectively.
Aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil, which began to generate power at full capacity in mid-2002. Aluminio receives its share of the output of the plant, which is sufficient to cover the remaining 51% of its operating needs at the Poos de Caldas smelter.
Aluminio has entered into agreements to participate in additional hydroelectric construction projects in Brazil. For more information on these projects, see Note M to the financial statements.
Europe - Electricity The company purchases electricity for its Italian smelters located at Portovesme and Fusina in the recently deregulated market, under annual contracts and special conditions expiring in 2005.
The companys smelters at San Ciprin, La Corua and Avils, Spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in December 2006, possibly extended to 2010.
Iceland - Electricity In March, 2003, Alcoa signed agreements to build its new Fjaral smelter in Eastern Iceland over the next four years. Central to those arrangements is a 40-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, will build a dam and power project, and supply competitively priced electricity to the smelter. The smelter is expected to begin taking power in the middle of 2007, and to reach full production thereafter.
Minority Interests - Electricity The smelters in Germany, Ghana, Norway and Venezuela, in which Alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager, have made a variety of long-term electricity purchase arrangements, under the managing partner or entity. The power contract for Germany runs through September 2005; discussions are underway with the supplier, HEW, regarding a possible extension or potential early termination. The other contracts are up for renewal at various times, the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020.
Canada & U.S. - Natural Gas The company generally procures natural gas on a competitively bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoas larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to 10 Table of Contents provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or NYMEX price. The company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials The major purchased raw materials in 2003 for each of the companys segments are listed below.
Alumina & Chemicals Primary Metals bauxite alumina caustic soda aluminum fluoride electricity calcined petroleum coke fuel oil cathode blocks natural gas electricity liquid pitch natural gas silicon carbide Flat-Rolled Products Engineered Products alloying materials cobalt aluminum scrap electricity coatings natural gas electricity nickel natural gas primary aluminum (billet) primary aluminum (rolling ingot) steel titanium Packaging & Consumer Other aluminum aluminum tape natural gas copper polyethylene resin compound glass fiber polypropylene resin compound polyvinyl chloride resin compound polyvinyl chloride resin compound Other materials generally are purchased from third party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements.

These joint ventures, owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Kobe), continue despite the termination in 2003 of the Alcoa-Kobe joint ventures in rolled aluminum sheet products for aluminum cans. The focus of these ventures, consisting of one company in the U.S. and one in Japan, is to expand the use of aluminum sheet products in passenger cars and light trucks. As a result of a restructuring of the venture in 2000, the U.S. company focuses on research and development efforts, while the Japanese company engages in commercial (manufacturing, marketing and sales) as well as research and development efforts, to serve the transportation industry. In 2003, Alcoa and Kobe further agreed to discuss extending this cooperation into joint research and development products related to other aluminum automotive products such as applied technology of aluminum extrusion and casting.
Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Company Limited.
Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Company Limited is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Shanghai Light Industry Equipment (Group) Co., Ltd. It produces aluminum foil products in Shanghai, China.
Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco).
In November 2001, Alcoa entered into a strategic alliance with Chalco and its parent company, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco). Under this alliance, in 2001 Alcoa became a strategic investor in Chalcos global offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Alcoas investment is 8% of the issued and outstanding shares. In connection with its investment, Alcoa is entitled to one seat on Chalcos board of directors. In early 2004, Chalco made an additional public share offering in which Alcoa purchased sufficient shares to maintain its holdings in Chalco at the 8% level.

12 Table of Contents Kaal Australia Pty. Limited and KSL Alcoa Aluminum Company, Ltd.
In October of 2003, Alcoa and Kobe terminated their joint ventures in Australia, known as Kaal Australia Pty. Limited, and in Japan, known as KSL Alcoa Aluminum Company, Ltd., that manufactured and sold aluminum sheet for aluminum cans. As a result of the termination, Alcoa acquired all of the shares of Kaal Australia Pty. Limited and of the Hong Kong sales company, Kaal Asia, Limited. In exchange, Kobe acquired the controlling interest in KSL Alcoa Aluminum Company, Ltd. Alcoa has granted Kobe a license to use Alcoas technology embedded in the Kaal Japan cold rolling mill. Alcoa has also agreed to act as a distributor for Kobes can sheet products in Asia. Both companies agreed to continue the supply of aluminum ingot to the Japan can stock operation for a certain period of time.
Yunnan Xinmeilu Aluminum Foil Co., Ltd.
This joint venture is owned 56% by Alcoa and 44% by Yunnan Aluminum Processing Factory. It produces aluminum foil products in Kunming, China. Alcoa does not have management control of this facility.
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks The company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The companys rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoas business is not, however, materially dependent on patents, and no individual patent is of material importance to any segment.
The company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits.
The company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer level, and others that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include Alcoa and the Alcoa Symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck fasteners, Kawneer building panels, Dura Bright surface treatments, Presto storage bags, Cut-Rite wax paper, Baco household wraps, Reynolds plastic wrap and Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil. The companys rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.
Competitive Conditions Alcoa is the worlds leading producer of alumina, primary aluminum and fabricated aluminum. Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Price, quality and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoas markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials  such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications; magnesium, titanium, composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications; steel, plastics and glass for packaging applications; and wood and vinyl for building and construction applications  aluminums diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability and flexibility, are also significant factors. For Alcoas segments that market products under Alcoas brand names, brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role.
Research and Development Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Alcoa conducts these activities 13 Table of Contents within its businesses and at the Alcoa Technical Center near Pittsburgh. Expenditures for R&D activities were $194 million in 2003, $214 million in 2002 and $202 million in 2001.
Most of the major process and product areas within the company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding product and process area, developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Certain business units alternatively conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center. Technical personnel from the TMRBs, the Technical Center and such business units also participate in the corresponding Market Sector Lead Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.
During 2003, the company continued work on new developments in inert anode technology and the pursuit of patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world related to these advanced technologies. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of anode assembly testing, although there remain technical and cost targets to overcome. Technical targets include improvement of anode life, reduction in operating voltage and maintenance of metal purity. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the company believes that it will be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology, resulting in significant operating cost savings. The new technology would also generate environmental benefits by reducing and eliminating certain emissions. No timetable has been established for commercial use.
Environmental Matters Information relating to environmental matters is included in three areas of the Annual Report: under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Environmental Matters on pages 35 and 36, in Note A to the financial statements under the caption Environmental Expenditures on page 46 and in Note X to the financial statements on page 62.
Employees Total worldwide employment at year-end 2003 was 120,000 people.
On October 12, 2001, the United Steelworkers of America ratified a new five-year labor agreement that covers 19 locations in the United States and about 12,000 employees. The contract is effective from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2006.
Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Forward-Looking Statements This report and the portions of the Annual Report incorporated by reference herein contain (and oral communications made by Alcoa may contain) forward-looking statements that may be identified by their use of words like anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, hopes, targets, should, will, will likely result, forecast, outlook, projects or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address Alcoas expectations or projections about the future, including statements about Alcoas strategy for growth, cost reduction goals, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on Alcoas estimates, assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Alcoa cannot guarantee that these estimates, assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. Alcoa disclaims any intention or obligation (other than as required by law) to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
14 Table of Contents Risk Factors In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in Managements Discussion and Analysis in the Annual Report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause Alcoas actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements:  Alcoa is the worlds leading producer of alumina, aluminum ingot and aluminum fabricated products. The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences. Prices can be volatile. Although Alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers, as well as forward, futures and options contracts, to manage its exposure to the volatility of LME-based prices, and is product and segment diversified, Alcoas results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by Alcoa, including the transportation, building, construction, distribution, packaging, industrial gas turbine, telecommunications and other markets.
Alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations. Although Alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, the following could affect Alcoas results of operations:  significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;  significant increases in natural gas prices;  unavailability of electrical power due to droughts;  interruptions in energy supply due to equipment failure or other causes; or  inability to extend contracts upon expiration on economical terms.
Alcoas ability to grow earnings will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, including caustic soda, calcined petroleum coke and resins, in addition to energy. Alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs through price increases or productivity improvements.
As part of its strategy for growth, Alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met.
Alcoa has investments and activities in numerous countries outside the U.S. and in emerging markets, including Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Korea, Mexico and Russia. Changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which Alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and Alcoas results of operations.
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and competitive factors in the countries in which Alcoa operates, could affect its revenues, expenses and results of operations.
The markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive. In addition, aluminum competes with other materials, such as steel, plastics and glass, among others, for various applications in Alcoas key markets. The willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by Alcoa, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting Alcoas competitors or customers could affect Alcoas results of operations.
A significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by Alcoa could affect Alcoas results of operations in a particular period.
Alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance, including deployment of company-wide business process models, such as the Alcoa 15 Table of Contents Business System and the Alcoa Enterprise Business Solution, an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across Alcoa for data, processes and supporting software. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.
Alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies, including inert anode technology. There can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Alcoa.
Alcoas operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to several sites.
Climate change agreements in several parts of the world may result in emission restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Alcoa is actively managing its greenhouse gas emissions and does not foresee a significant impact from possible legislation in this area. Anticipated emission trading and sequestration programs would appear to allow Alcoa to meet any greenhouse gas obligations using current plans and past credits.
Alcoas results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Alcoa, including product liability, safety and health and other claims.
Alcoas estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). Alcoas results of operations, liquidity or shareholders equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions.
Alcoa has projected a likely range of proceeds from the divestiture of the businesses and operations announced in the fourth quarter of 2002. There can be no assurance that Alcoa will realize the projected amount of proceeds from such divestitures.
War or terrorist activities may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact Alcoas financial performance.
The above list of important factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.

Alcoa does lease some of its facilities; however, it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or their values. The company leases a portion of the equipment and facilities at its Texarkana, Tex plant. AFL and Southern Graphic Systems, Inc. lease most of their facilities. Ivex Packaging Corporation leases certain of its facilities.
Alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of properties owned by Alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report, the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties. See Notes H and T to the financial statements for information on properties, plants and equipment and lease expense.
19 Table of Contents Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
In the ordinary course of its business, Alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. It is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies. Management believes, however, that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company.
Environmental Matters Alcoa is involved in proceedings under the Superfund or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at several such sites.
Since 1989, Alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the Grasse River, adjacent to Alcoas Massena, New York plant site, under order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under Section 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA). Sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). In the fourth quarter of 1999, Alcoa submitted an Analysis of Alternatives Report to the EPA. This Report identified potential courses of remedial action related to the PCB contamination of the river. The EPA indicated to Alcoa that it believed additional remedial alternatives needed to be included in the Analysis of Alternatives Report. During 2000 and 2001, Alcoa completed certain studies and investigations on the river, including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies. In February 2002, Alcoa submitted a final Analysis of Alternatives Report based on these additional evaluations and included additional remedial alternatives required by the EPA. The range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report is between $2 million and $525 million. Alcoa believes that rational, scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or man-made processes. Based on the current assessment of the EPA decision-making process, the company has now concluded that the selection of the $2 million alternative, based on natural recovery only, is remote. In June 2003, based on river observations during the spring of 2003, the EPA requested that Alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup. Alcoa has collected a significant portion of the additional data and is in the process of data analysis and determining how this phenomenon should be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered. It is anticipated that a report of findings will be issued to the EPA in the second quarter of 2004. Subsequent to this submittal, a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report will be submitted at a date to be determined.
Alcoa continues to believe that alternatives involving the largest amounts of sediment removal should not be selected for the Grasse River remedy. Therefore, the company believes that the alternatives that should reasonably be considered for selection range from engineered capping and natural recovery of $30 million to a combination of moderate dredging, capping and natural recovery of $90 million. Accordingly, Alcoa has adjusted the reserve for the Grasse River to $30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives, as no one of the alternatives is more likely to be selected than any other. The EPAs ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability. However, as the process allows for input that can influence the scope and cost of the remedy through the issuance of the formal Record of Decision (ROD), Alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the ROD is issued.
Representatives of various U.S. federal and state agencies and a Native American tribe, acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources, have asserted that Alcoa and Reynolds Metals Company (Reynolds) may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on Alcoas and Reynolds operations at their Massena, New York and St. Lawrence, New York facilities. While formal proceedings have not been instituted, the company continues to actively investigate these claims.
20 Table of Contents Since 1990, Alcoa has undertaken investigations and evaluations concerning alleged releases of mercury from its Point Comfort, Texas facility into the adjacent Lavaca Bay pursuant to a Superfund order from the EPA. In March 1994, the EPA listed the Alcoa (Point Comfort)/Lavaca Bay Site on the National Priorities List, and Alcoa and Region VI of the EPA entered into an administrative order on consent, EPA docket no. 6-11-94, concerning the site. The administrative order required the company to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study under EPA oversight. Following submission by the company of all required information, in December 2001, the EPA issued its ROD selecting the final remedial approach for the site, which is fully reserved. The company continues to negotiate a Consent Order with the EPA under which it will undertake to implement the remedy. The company and certain federal and state natural resource trustees, who previously served Alcoa with notice of their intent to file suit to recover damages for alleged loss or injury of natural resources in Lavaca Bay, have cooperatively identified restoration alternatives and approaches for Lavaca Bay. The cost of such restoration is reserved and Alcoa continues to negotiate a Consent Decree with the trustees under which it will implement the restoration. Alcoa does not believe that any additional liability for this site is reasonably possible.
In July 2001, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) filed an administrative law proceeding, docket no. 2001-5918-EQ, against Discovery Aluminas, Inc. (Discovery), an Alcoa subsidiary, and Waste Management, Inc. (Waste Management) seeking civil penalties for alleged infractions of DEQs hazardous waste regulations. Both Discovery and Waste Management denied the allegations and formal information discovery followed. During the second quarter of 2003, Discovery settled its involvement in this matter with the DEQ for a civil penalty payment of $75,000.
In May through October 2002, eleven lawsuits were filed against Reynolds and Alcoa in the District Court of Wharton County, Texas, five of which have since been dismissed. In the same timeframe, another lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Victoria Division, but was later dismissed. The cases were originally removed to federal court, but all were remanded back to state court in Wharton County and consolidated. The lawsuits seek to recover damages relating to the presence of trichloroethylene in the groundwater near a former Reynolds extrusion facility in El Campo, Texas. Additional defendants included in some of the lawsuits are the current owners to whom Reynolds sold the facility in 1997, Bon L. Campo Limited Partnership (Bon L. Campo) and Tredegar Corporation, a former plant owner from 1968-71, Whittaker Corporation, and two neighboring businesses. Some of the cases request class certification to include other allegedly affected individuals as plaintiffs. Damages sought include those for the contamination of private wells, diminution of property value, medical monitoring and punitive damages. The only significant personal injury claim was settled in 2003. Reynolds owned and operated the facility from 1971 to 1997 and sold it to Bon L. Campo before Alcoa acquired Reynolds. Reynolds and Alcoa are currently participating in the Voluntary Cleanup Program under the supervision of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and investigating the area to determine the source of the contamination. Reynolds and Alcoa have filed suit in the federal court referred to above against Whittaker Corporation for contribution to the cleanup effort. Trial of the first group of fifty-eight plaintiffs with property damage claims is scheduled to begin in March 2004.
In August 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) notified IPC, Inc. (IPC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ivex Packaging Corporation (Ivex), and Consolidated Fibers, Inc. (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of IPC, that they were potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA at the Agriculture Street Landfill Superfund Site, New Orleans, Louisiana. In August 2002, the EPA and DOJ extended an offer to CFI to engage in pre-filing settlement discussions regarding the United States claim for response costs at the Site. The EPA and DOJ stated that the government had incurred approximately $40.6 million in response costs at the Site and sought a settlement amount of approximately $13.8 million to be paid collectively by CFI and other PRPs. Ivex contends that CFIs involvement with the site was minimal. The United States filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on December 6, 2002 for recovery of its response costs. CFI was named as a defendant. An answer has been filed and discovery is continuing.
On September 26, 2003, EPA Region VI filed an administrative Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against Howmet Corporations Wichita Falls, Texas facility for violations of hazardous waste regulations relating to shipments of used potassium hydroxide to a fertilizer manufacturer from 1997 until 21 Table of Contents 2000. The Complaint proposes a penalty of $265,128. In addition, EPA ordered Howmet Corporation (Howmet) to cease sending used potassium hydroxide to fertilizer manufacturers or employing used potassium hydroxide in any use constituting disposal and to certify compliance with hazardous waste regulations within 30 days. On October 22, 2003, EPA Region II issued an almost identical Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against Howmets Dover, New Jersey facility, seeking $180,021 in penalties. On October 28, 2002 and December 8, 2003, Howmet filed its Answers to EPA Region VIs and EPA Region IIs Complaints, respectively. Howmets Answers denied the substance of EPAs Complaints, requested that no penalties be imposed and requested Hearings on both the hazardous waste allegations and the Compliance Orders. These matters are pending before EPA.
In September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck the U.S. Virgin Islands, including the St. Croix Alumina LLC facility on the island of St. Croix. The wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas. Various clean-up and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on behalf of St. Croix Alumina. A Notice of Violation was issued by the Division of Environmental Protection of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources of the Virgin Islands Government, and has been contested by the company. A civil suit was commenced in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands by certain residents of St. Croix in February 1999 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries and property damages associated with bauxite or red dust from the St. Croix Alumina facility. The suit, which has been removed to the District Court of the Virgin Islands, names St. Croix Alumina LLC, Alcoa Inc. and Glencore Ltd. as defendants, and in August 2000 was accorded class action treatment. The class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who suffered damages and/or injuries as a result of exposure during and after Hurricane Georges to red dust and red mud blown during Hurricane Georges. All of the defendants have denied liability, and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since 1999. In October 2003, the defendants received plaintiffs expert reports. These reports claim that the material blown during Hurricane Georges consisted of bauxite and red mud, and contained crystalline silica, chromium and other substances. The reports go on to claim, among other things, that the population of the six subject neighborhoods as of the 2000 census (a total of 3,730 people) has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants, and hence will be able to show entitlement to lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and punitive relief. These opinions are in the process of being contested by the defendants. Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina LLC have turned over this matter to their insurance carriers who are providing a defense. Glencore Ltd. is jointly defending the case with Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina LLC, but has a pending motion to dismiss.
In 2001 and 2002, two companion lawsuits were filed in the Court of Lafayette County, Arkansas on behalf of nearly 400 current or former residents of the City of Stamps, Arkansas, the City of Stamps and former employees of Red River Aluminum, Inc. (RRA), a dross processor. The 2001 action has been transferred to Miller County, Arkansas. The suits name 12 defendants (including Alumax, Reynolds and Alcoa) that sent dross to RRA for processing. Plaintiffs have filed claims for personal injuries and property damage and have alleged that the defendants violated Arkansas environmental statutes relating to the alleged contamination associated with RRAs operations in Stamps. These matters are currently set for trial in the second quarter of 2004.
Other Matters Alcoa initiated a lawsuit in King County, Washington in December 1992 against nearly 100 insurance companies that provided insurance coverage for environmental property damage at Alcoa plant sites between the years 1956 and 1985. The trial for the first three sites concluded in October 1996 with a jury verdict partially in Alcoas favor and an award of damages to Alcoa. In its post-trial decisions, the trial court substantially reduced the amount that Alcoa would be able to recover from its insurers on these three sites. Alcoa appealed these rulings to the Washington Court of Appeals, which certified the appeal to the Washington Supreme Court. Alcoa prevailed on significant portions of the appeal and the matter was set for trial in 22 Table of Contents September 2003. During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, Alcoa reached settlement of the litigation with all of the defendants and the settlements were reflected in the quarters results.
Along with various asbestos manufacturers, distributors and premises users, Alcoa and/or its subsidiaries are defendants in several hundred active individual lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos at various company facilities. In addition to the above cases, an Alcoa subsidiary has been routinely named, along with a large common group of industrial companies, in a standardized complaint utilized by one particular law firm where the companys involvement is not evident. Since 1999, several thousand such complaints have been filed. To date, Alcoas subsidiary has been dismissed from almost every case that was actually placed in line for trial. Alcoa, its subsidiaries and acquired companies, all have had numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims. Many of these policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations. Alcoa believes that between its reserves and insurance it is adequately covered for its known asbestos exposures. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the financial condition of the company.
In July 1999, Alcoa Aluminio S.A. received notice that an administrative proceeding was commenced by Brazils Secretary of Economic Law of the Ministry of Justice against Brazilian producers of primary aluminum, including Alcoa Aluminio. The suit alleges collusive action in the pricing of primary aluminum in violation of Brazilian antitrust law. Alcoa Aluminio has presented its defense and is awaiting the decision of the Secretary of Economic Law. If the Secretary of Economic Law determines that the antitrust law was violated, then the action may be further prosecuted by the Administrative Council of Economic Defense. Brazilian law provides for civil and criminal sanctions for violations of antitrust law, including fines ranging from 1% to 30% of a companys revenue during the last fiscal year.
As previously reported, in the first half of 2002, Alcoa discovered that a former Reynolds distribution entity, RASCO, may have sold approximately 750,000 pounds of aluminum plate made by an unrelated company for use in the Northwest maritime industry that may not be suitable for that use. Reynolds and the current owner of the business and the manufacturer of the metal are working jointly to identify the issues and find resolutions. All identified customers have been notified of the issue, inspection protocols have been put into place and the U. S. Coast Guard has been notified and is involved in the resolution process. Three lawsuits were originally filed by ship owners or operators and each has been resolved. The parties have been working cooperatively toward satisfactory resolutions. Currently, the company has expensed the amount of the loss it considers probable. During 2003, Alcoa reached resolution with one of its insurers regarding its coverage claims and filed a coverage suit against another carrier in early 2004.
