Exhibits and Financial Statement     Schedules 136 Signatures 142 2 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1.Business by Segment CSX Corporation (CSX and together with its subsidiaries, the Company), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies.Surface Transportation, which includes the Companys rail and intermodal businesses, provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers.
Rail CSXs principal operating company, CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), provides a crucial link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000 route mile rail network, which serves every major population center in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.It serves 70 ocean, river and lake ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 230 short-line and regional railroads.
Other Entities In addition to CSXT, the rail segment includes Total Distribution Services, Inc. (TDSI), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (Transflo), CSX Technology, Inc. (CSX Technology) and other subsidiaries. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations, while Transflo provides logistical solutions for transferring products from rail to trucks. Technology and other support services are provided by CSX Technology and other subsidiaries.
Intermodal CSX Intermodal, Inc. (Intermodal), one of the nations largest coast-to-coast intermodal transportation providers, is a stand-alone, integrated intermodal company linking customers to railroads via trucks and terminals.Containers and trailers are loaded and unloaded from trains, and trucks provide the link between intermodal terminals and the customer.
Surface Transportation Businesses The rail and intermodal segments are designated by the Company on a combined basis as Surface Transportation businesses.Together, they generated $10 billion of revenue during 2007 and served four primary lines of business:  The       merchandise business is the most diverse market with nearly 2.7 million       carloads per year of aggregates, which includes crushed stone, sand and       gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer, agricultural, paper       and chemical products.The merchandise business generated       approximately 50% of the Companys revenue in 2007 and 38% of       volume.
3 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I  Coal,       which delivered approximately 1.9 million carloads of coal, coke and iron       ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers       and terminals, steel makers and industrial plants, accounted for       approximately 26% of the Companys revenue and volume in 2007. The       Company transports almost one-third of every ton of coal used for       generating electricity in the areas served by   CSX.
Automotive,       which delivers both finished vehicles and auto parts, generated 8% of the       Companys revenue and 6% of the Companys volume in 2007.The       Company delivers approximately one-third of North Americas light       vehicles, serving both traditional manufacturers and the increasing number       of global manufacturers.
Intermodal       offers a competitive cost advantage over long-haul trucking by combining       the superior economics of rail transportation with the short-haul       flexibility of trucks. Through its network of more than 50       terminals, Intermodal serves all major markets east of the Mississippi       River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers,       providing customers with truck-like service for longer       shipments.For 2007, Intermodal accounted for approximately 14%       of the Companys total revenue and 30% of   volume.
Other revenue, which includes revenue from regional railroads (that are partially owned by CSX), demurrage, switching and other incidental charges, accounted for 2% of the Companys total 2007 revenue.Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by railroads that CSX does not directly operate.Demurrage represents charges assessed by railroads when shippers or receivers of freight hold railcars beyond a specified period of time.Switching revenue is generated when CSXT switches cars between trains for a customer or another railroad.
Other Businesses CSXs other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the Companys real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities, and CSX Hotels, Inc., a resort doing business as The Greenbrier, located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.Pretax earnings of $42 million, $24 million and $85 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from these activities are classified as a component of other income.These items are classified in other income because they are not considered by the Company to be operating activities and may fluctuate with the timing of real estate sales and resort seasonality.
The Company also has certain residual activities from formerly owned companies that include leasing of equipment and vessels.These results are included in consolidated operating income and totaled $5 million, $12 million and $1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Financial Information about Operating Segments See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for operating revenue, operating income and total assets by segment for each of the last three fiscal years.
4 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Company History A leader in freight rail transportation for 180 years, the Companys roots date back to the early nineteenth century when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O)  the nations first common carrier  was chartered in 1827. Since that time, CSX has built on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision to create a railroad that safely and reliably services the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation.
In those 180 years, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX.Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought to CSX unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.
CSX was incorporated in 1978, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System (Chessie) and Seaboard Coast Line Industries (Seaboard) into CSX.The merger allowed CSX to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. In 1986, the Chessie and Seaboard operating entities were transferred to the rail entity CSXT, which was created through the merger.Intermodal was originally formed in 1986 in order to provide nationwide, door-to-door intermodal service.
In 1997, CSXT and Norfolk Southern jointly acquired the rights to operate Conrail, Inc. (Conrail) and then in 2004, CSXT acquired an allocated portion of Conrails assets, which CSXT operated.Conrail was formed in 1976 from several financially troubled northeast railroads to restructure and revive the regions railroads.CSXs acquisition of key portions of Conrail allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago, Midwest markets and the growing areas in the southeast that were already served by CSXT.This current rail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with dependable, environmentally friendly and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.
5 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Regulatory Environment The Company's operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, generally applicable to many businesses in the United States. The railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which are both part of the Department of Transportation (DOT).Additionally, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has the authority to issue regulations and other directives that may also affect railroad operations. In some cases, state and local laws and regulations can be preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other federal authorities.
Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the rail traffic of the Company's subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate regulation by agency decision, the STB has broad jurisdiction over railroad commercial practices.This includes jurisdiction over freight car rent, the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common carriers.In 2007, for example, the STB issued decisions changing its long-standing policy on fuel surcharges, its rules for large freight rate cases and a new process for rate cases where smaller amounts are at issue.
The FRA and its sister agency within the DOT, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration, have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars and locomotives, and hazardous materials requirements.The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications.The TSA has proposed regulations that would apply to the transportation of certain kinds of highly hazardous materials.Decisions of these and other agencies can affect the profitability of the Companys business.For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 8.
Competition The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive.Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price.Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Companys primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation.
CSXs primary rail competitor is the Norfolk Southern, which operates throughout much of CSXs territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels.For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 8.
6 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Other Information CSX makes available on its website www.csx.com , free of charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, the Company has posted its code of ethics on its website, which is also available to any shareholder who requests it.This Form 10-K and other SEC filings are also accessible through the SECs website at www.sec.gov .
CSX has included the certifications of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) regarding the Companys public disclosure required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act) as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, as well as Section 906 of the Act as Exhibits 32.1 and 32.2 to this Form 10-K report. Additionally, on May 31, 2007, CSX filed its annual CEO certification with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) confirming the Companys compliance with the NYSE Corporate Governance Listing Standards.The CEO was not aware of any violations of these standards by the Company as of January 31, 2008 (the latest practicable date that is closest to the filing of this Form 10-K).
The Companys annual average number of employees was approximately 35,000 in 2007, which includes approximately 29,000 union employees.Most of the Companys employees provide or support transportation services.The information set forth in Item 6. Selected Financial Data is incorporated herein by reference.
For additional information concerning business conducted by the Company during 2007, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15, Business Segments.
7 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1A.Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Companys forward-looking statements.Although the risks described below are those that management believes are the most significant, these are not the only risks facing the Company.Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Companys earnings or regulate its ability to independently negotiate prices.
The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters.Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Companys business.For example, regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Companys profitability.Also, additional regulations related to environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions or legislative changes impacting hours of service requirements could adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.
Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier obligation.A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation.CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.Failure to comply with these regulations can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident.Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances.
The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.
The Companys operations are subject to wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases.In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company.
8 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Companys incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination.
Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.
General economic, geo-political and compliance risks may affect the Companys operations and financial results.
Changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for rail or intermodal services could adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.In addition, abrupt political change or terrorist activity poses a risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in the operations and security arrangements, thus increasing the operating costs.These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and purchasing decisions by the Companys customers.
Fuel prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic circumstances.Although a fuel recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers, the Company could be negatively impacted if it were unable to realize fuel surcharges.Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would be negatively impacted.
The FRA regulates several of the Companys core operations including track and mechanical equipment standards, signaling systems, inspection of grade crossing warning devices, locomotive engineer certifications and employee injury reporting, among other areas.The Companys unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in CSX.In addition, a change in these regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Network congestion, caused by unanticipated increases in freight or passenger activity, could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.
The Company may experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity, unplanned increases in demand for rail service, increased passenger activities in capacity-constrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can transport freight or its service routes that could have a negative effect on the Companys operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency. In addition, the Company may face external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, which may disrupt the Companys operations.
9 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Increases in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage, occupational injury claims, and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents, worker injury claims under FELA and claims from outside parties resulting from the Companys operations. Although the Company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company could experience material property damage, personal injury or occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend such claims.
Existing claims may suffer adverse developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Companys control. The Company establishes reserves to cover all of these types of claims.However, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves.
The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
The Company is subject to various existing lawsuits and potential unknown litigation.The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such lawsuits.Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse development not currently reflected in the Companys reserve estimates as the ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside of the Companys control.While the Company uses its best efforts to evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments may differ materially from the recorded reserves.
Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Companys operations.
Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred in the United States in September 2001, in Spain in March 2004, in England in July 2005, and in India in July 2006, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.CSXTs rail lines or other key infrastructure may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war.This could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues.In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available.
Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry.For example, the DHS proposed regulations that would require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials.
10 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.
Most of CSXT's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee.In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages.Over the last 30 years, there were only six days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national handling.If the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.Under the Railway Labor Acts procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may exercise self-help until the procedures are exhausted.
The Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.
The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business.A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software and communications equipment, could result in a service interruption, safety failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.While the Company has taken steps to mitigate these risks, the performance and reliability of its technology systems are critical to its ability to compete effectively.
The Company faces competition from rail carriers and other transportation providers.
The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
11 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments None.
Item 2.Properties by Segment Rail Property CSXTs properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars.These categories and the geography of the network are described below.
Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the Midwestern cities of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.
CSXTs track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards (known as mainline track); track within terminals and switching yards; track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains; track connecting the mainline track to customer locations ; and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts.Total track miles are greater than the Companys approximately 21,000 route miles, which reflect the size of CSXs rail network that connects markets, customers and western railroads.At December 2007, the breakdown of track miles was as follows: Track Miles Mainline       track 26,712 Terminals       and switching yards 9,626 Passing       sidings and turnouts 1,037 Total 37,375 In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and terminals. These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and placed onto new outbound trains.
12 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I The following 36 yards are identified as key to the CSXT system (listed in alphabetical order by state): Rail       Yards or Terminals Birmingham,       AL Detroit,       MI Mobile,       AL Hamlet,       NC Montgomery,       AL Rocky       Mount, NC Baldwin,       FL Buffalo,       NY Moncrief       (Jacksonville), FL Selkirk,       NY Tampa,       FL Syracuse,       NY Atlanta,       GA Cincinnati,       OH East       Savannah, GA Cleveland,       OH Waycross,       GA Columbus,       OH Avon       (Indianapolis), IN Stanley       (Toledo), OH Chicago,       IL Walbridge       (Toledo), OH Evansville,       IN Willard,       OH Louisville,       KY Greenwich       (Philadelphia), PA Russell,       KY Charleston,       SC New       Orleans, LA Florence,       SC Cumberland,       MD Erwin,       TN Curtis       Bay (Baltimore), MD Nashville,       TN Locust       Point (Baltimore), MD Richmond,       VA For a list of Intermodals terminals, see page 16.
Network Geography CSXTs train operations are primarily focused around the following four major transportation networks, which are defined geographically or by line of business and are described below.
Coal Network  Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States.The CSXT coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake and seaport facilities.This network also supports the strong, growing utility market in the southeast.
Southeastern Corridor This section of the network runs from the western gateways of Chicago, Memphis and St. Louis through the growing cities of Nashville, Birmingham and Atlanta and into the expanding markets in the southeast. CSXTs capacity investment in this corridor clearly strengthens this route and makes it the premier rail route connecting these key cities and gateways with the growing southeast. The corridor extends through the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and provides direct rail service between these coal sources and the increasing demand for coal in the southeast. The increase in capacity on this corridor positions CSXT well to handle the projected traffic volumes of intermodal, coal, automotive and general merchandise traffic.
13 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England are linked by CSXTs I-90 Corridor.Much of this route has two lanes of track side-by-side (referred to as double mainline track) supporting high-speed intermodal and automotive services.The I-90 Corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the northeast.Continued growth in consumption in the east and northeast makes this corridor a critical element in the Companys overall system.
Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the growing southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York along CSXTs I-95 Corridor.This route is primarily used to ship food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals.It is the only rail corridor along the east coast south of Washington, D.C., and provides access to all the major eastern ports.
Locomotives CSXT focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail network.Better locomotive management helps CSXT move freight more efficiently, while continued investment in CSXTs power source means CSXT is operating more locomotives better.
CSXT operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 95% are owned by CSXT.Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull rail cars.Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination.Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain.At December 2007, CSXTs owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the following: Locomotives % Freight 3,495 87% Switching 324 8% Auxiliary       Units 188 5% Total 4,007 100% Freight Car Fleet The average daily fleet of cars-on-line consists of approximately 222,000 cars, but at any point in time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned or leased by CSXT. Examples of these are: railcars owned by other railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which are generally used only in that shippers service) and multi-level railcars.
14 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART I CSXTs freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars: Gondolas Support CSXTs metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk commodities.Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations STRATEGIC OVERVIEW The Company provides customers access to a modern transportation network that connects ports, production and distribution centers to markets in the Northeast, Midwest and the rapidly growing southern states.The Company transports a diversified portfolio of products, from domestically abundant coal to new energy sources such as ethanol, from automobiles produced by traditional American manufacturers to new domestic factories owned by European, Japanese and Korean companies, and from life-essential chemicals to life-enriching consumer electronics. Additionally, the Company serves every major market in the eastern United States and has direct access to all Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports, as well as the Mississippi River, The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.Furthermore, the Company has access to Pacific ports through alliances with western railroads. Overall, the Companys transportation network encompasses approximately 21,000 route miles of track in 23 states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
As the nation consumes increasingly higher quantities of imported goods, those products must be transported across the country in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs.The Companys transportation network, located in the largest and fastest-growing population centers in the nation, is well-positioned to capitalize on consumption growth trends.In this regard, more than two-thirds of Americans live within the Companys service territory, accounting for about three-quarters of the nations consumption.
The Company has made substantial strides in operating performance in order to capitalize on these consumption growth trends.In 2004, the Company implemented the ONE Plan, which continues to focus on optimizing the train network and utilizing rail assets more efficiently.Anchored by the ONE Plan and a variety of other initiatives implemented after the ONE Plan was introduced, the Company has achieved significant operational improvements that have enhanced safety, service reliability and productivity.These strong results include the highest customer satisfaction scores ever achieved by the Company as measured by independent surveys of its customers.
In addition to the ONE Plan, the Company recently embarked on a new initiative called Total Service Integration (TSI), which aims to better align the Companys capabilities with customer demands.TSI aimsto optimize train size and increase asset utilization while deliveringmore reliable service to customers.
26 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II These initiatives delivered strong results for shareholders whilehigher levels of customer service have led to improved pricing.These efforts combined with operational efficiencies have resulted in substantial improvements in CSXs operating incomeand operating ratio.
In addition to driving better financial results to create value for shareholders, CSX also employs a balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of shareholders.This approach includes investments in the future, share repurchases and dividends.Through this balanced use of financial resources, CSX will continue to capitalize on an economic environment that is increasingly favoring rail transportation.
2007 CSX Highlights Surface Transportation  Revenue       grew $464 million or 5% to over $10 billion.
Expenses       increased $339 million or 5% to $7.8 billion, which included $141 million       of higher prior year gains on insurance recoveries (which reduced       operating expenses) and $98 million of higher fuel   costs.
Surface       Transportation Operating Income, which excludes other operating income,       increased $125 million to $2.3 billion.
Service       and safety measurements improved in all   categories.
Leadership, discipline and execution resulted in excellent 2007 results, which included the lowest Surface Transportation operating ratio in a decade.Revenue and revenue per unit increased 5% and 8%, respectively, from a year ago reflecting the improving value CSX provides its customers through better service.The Company was able to achieve substantial pricing gains predominantly due to CSXT service improvements and the overall cost advantages that the Companys rail-based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation.
The strong results in revenue were achieved despite volume declines in all of the Companys four major lines of business.The overall 3% volume decrease versus last year was primarily driven by continued weakness in the merchandise market relating to housing construction and associated markets, as well as lower automotive production.
Expenses were higher due to the effects of rising fuel prices and higher prior year gains on insurance recoveries, which were recorded as a reduction to operating expenses.Lower 2007 volume and better productivity from improved operations partially offset the effects of inflation for certain expense categories.
27 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II For additional information, refer to Rail and Intermodal Results of Operations discussed on pages 40 through 43.
The Companys continued focus on safety and operating plan execution helped all service measurements improve compared to last year.Within the service measures, CSX achieved record performance on both of its key safety measures (FRA Personal Injuries Frequency Index and FRA Train Accident Rate) in 2007 despite some costly train accidents. Improved safety is the result of the safety leadership and train accident prevention processes. Both of these use training, awareness, compliance measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work environment.
In addition, CSX continues to improve its train operations with gains of 4% and 12% in On-Time Train Originations and On-Time Destination Arrivals, respectively.Velocity, a measure of overall network fluidity, increased 5% in 2007.More important was the consistent week-to-week velocity, which indicates more reliable service to customers.Improved network operations also drove increased asset utilization, including an improvement of 8% in Dwell, which is the average time cars spend in terminals when being switched. The table below shows these key measurements and resources.

Surface Transportation capital expenditures, which exclude The Greenbrier, were $1.7 billion in 2007.This level of investment highlights the Companys commitment to maintain and improve its existing infrastructure and to position itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity.The increase compared to prior year was largely due to refinancing a portion of its locomotive capacity by replacing 150 leased units with newly owned locomotives.
CSX also announced three significant financial events in 2007.First, CSX increased its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.12 during the first quarter of 2007.It then increased the dividend again during the third quarter of 2007 to $0.15, which represented a 50% increase from the quarterly dividend level at fourth quarter 2006.Finally, CSX announced a total of $3 billion in share repurchase programs during 2007 and has completed about 70% of the repurchases.See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.
Expectations Long-term Transportation Demand Transportation demand is based on increases in population and higher consumption levels, which in turn drive the production of goods domestically and abroad that must be transported from factories and ports to the markets where they will be consumed.
Recent census projections estimate that todays population of 301 million people will grow to more than 330 million by 2020. Major metropolitan areas in the southeast, where CSX has a strong presence, are projected to grow at significantly faster rates. Even in slower-growing areas over the remainder of the Companys territory, consumption levels are projected to increase.
Freight tonnage  domestic and international  is expected to increase nearly 50% by 2020, according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), placing further strain on the transportation system of America and requiring reliable solutions for shippers worldwide.
30 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Impact on CSX The Company is well positioned to meet the nations growing transportation demand. For example, due to factors such as highway congestion, new regulations on hours of service and driver shortages in the trucking industry, trucking companies are beginning to partner with the Company to outsource their long-haul services and reduce their cost of shipping due to the superior cost structure of the railroads for long-haul shipments.
Additionally, the need for environmentally sensitive transportation solutions also favors CSX because railroads are three times more fuel efficient than highway transportation. A single train can carry the load of more than 280 trucks, reducing highway congestion and pollution while moving goods more efficiently.
Industry analysts predict that the pricing environment will reflect the increasing importance of railroads in serving Americas growing transportation needs and the cost of the infrastructure investments needed to maintain the safety and security of these networks and to expand them. This will drive revenue growth as volumes increase. Furthermore, while the market for transportation services remains competitive, tighter capacity and improved service levels through initiatives such as the ONE Plan and TSI are expected to sustain this favorable pricing environment, reflecting the overall value that CSX provides to its customers.
Forecasts The Company bases its performance expectations on external forecasts of economic indicators such as gross domestic product, industrial production and overall import levels.Although certain markets will remain weak, such as those that are impacted by the housing and automotive sectors, the indicators that influence CSXs businesses are expected to be favorable in 2008. Considering these and other factors, the Company believes that its business environment remains strong and will support consistent, continuous financial improvements for the next several years.
Considering the Companys solid overall business environment, along with momentum in its underlying business performance, CSX expects that its financial performance in 2008 will be consistent with its long-term financial targets, which include compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) as shown below: Long-term       Financial Targets 2008-2010       Targets  Operating       Income Growth 10%       - 12% CAGR  Earnings       Per Share Growth 15%       - 17% CAGR  Operating       Ratio Mid-       tolow- 70s by 2010  Free       Cash Flow (before the payment of dividends) $800       million to $1 billion in 2010 31 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II To reinforce its long-term vision, the Companys Surface Transportation capital budget is expected to be nearly $5 billion between 2008 and 2010. These investments come at a time when the return on investment in the railroad industry is improving. Approximately 60% of the Companys capital is targeted for infrastructure investment to improve network reliability and recoverability and to drive even better performance in safety. Another 20% of the Companys capital will be invested in its locomotive and freight car fleets. The remaining 20% of CSXs capital spending will further expand network terminal capacity, improve technology and position the Company for long-term growth.
Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures.
Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Companys financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities.
Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions, dividends and certain other investing activities such as insurance proceeds.Also, added to free cash flow is the Companys 42% economic interest in Conrails free cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts.Other deposits, which are included in cash provided by operating activities, are not included in the Companys free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that were set aside for specific debt payments.

NM - not meaningful (a) Other operating income was $5 million and $12 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Operating Revenue Operating revenue increased $464 million to over $10 billion in 2007 due to continued pricing efforts and service improvements.These gains were partially offset by lower volume due to weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related markets.
35 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Operating Income Operating income increased $118 million to $2.3 billion in 2007.Improvements in revenue and productivity from improved operations were partially offset by lower gains on insurance recoveries and increased fuel costs.
Other Income Other income of $93 million in 2007 was relatively flat compared to the prior year.
Interest Expense Interest expense increased $25 million to $417 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances.
Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $175 million to $706 million.This change is primarily due to higher earnings in 2007 and a prior year income tax benefit of $151 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters that were not repeated.
Net Earnings Consolidated net earnings increased $26 million and totaled $1.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.17 to $2.99.The principal elements of these increases are:  Operating       income increased $118 million driven by strong Surface Transportation       results.These strong results were more than offset by $151       million of prior year income tax benefits that were not       repeated.The net of these and other items decreased earnings       from continuing operations by $84 million or $.08 per diluted       share.
The       $110 million or $.25 per diluted share gain in discontinued operations on       the Companys consolidated income statement in 2007 related to the       resolution of certain tax matters associated with previously discontinued       operations.

(a) Other       operating income was $12 million and $1 million in 2006 and 2005,       respectively.
Operating Revenue Operating revenue increased $948 million in 2006 to $9.6 billion, compared to $8.6 billion for the prior year.The primary components of the revenue gain were continued yield management and the Companys fuel surcharge program, which drove revenue per unit across all major markets.
Operating Income Operating income increased $588 million to $2.1 billion in 2006, which was driven by increased operating revenues.These revenue gains and gains on insurance proceeds from Hurricane Katrina were partially offset by increases in fuel expense caused by higher fuel prices and lower hedge benefits.
Other Income Other income decreased $6 million to $95 million in 2006.This change was driven primarily by lower real estate sales, which was partially offset by an after-tax non-cash gain on additional Conrail property value received in connection with the 2004 Conrail spin-off transaction.
37 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $31 million to $392 million in 2006 compared to the prior year.There was lower interest expense from lower average debt balances for 2006 (due to a $1.0 billion debt repurchase in mid-2005).However, this savings was partially offset by higher variable interest rates.
Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $215 million to $531 million in 2006 as a result of higher earnings.This increase was partially offset by the net impact of favorable resolutions of certain tax matters in 2006 that were higher than benefits in 2005.
Net Earnings Net earnings for 2006 increased $165 million to $1.3 billion, with earnings per share up $.30 to $2.82 per diluted share from the prior year.This increase was primarily due to the following factors:  Driven       by Surface Transportation results, earnings from continuing operations       were up $590 million, or $1.23 per diluted   share;  Offsetting       this increase was income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $425       million, or $.93 per diluted share, as a result of the sale of CSXs       International Terminals business in 2005.

39 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2007 vs. 2006 Rail Results of Operations Rail Operating Revenue Rail revenue is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Revenue increased $520 million, or 6%, to $8.7 billion in 2007 as compared to prior year.CSXT was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the Companys rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. These pricing gains more than offset volume weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related markets.
Merchandise Chemicals Revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment.Overall volume declined slightly driven by reduced chlorine shipments and weakness in propane demand due to a milder winter in 2007.
Emerging Markets Revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management efforts.Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in residential construction.
Forest Products Revenue and volume declined as shipments of building products and paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media substitution.
Agriculture Products Strong domestic demand in feed ingredients and soybean shipments supported growth in volume and revenue.Ethanol volumes also increased as a result of expanded use in the Northeast.Revenue per unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management.
Metals Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing actions. Lower demand for steel due to weakness in housing construction and domestic automobile production resulted in volume declines.
Phosphates and Fertilizers Volume was flat as higher domestic demand was offset by a decrease in export shipments.Favorable mix driven by these volume changes coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue and revenue per unit.
Food and Consumer Revenue and volume declines were driven by decreased demand for building products, appliances and roofing granules, which are used to make shingles.
40 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Coal Favorable pricing positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit. Overall tonnage was flat even though carloads slightly declined due to the use of higher capacity cars allowing the movement of more tons with fewer cars.Strength in the export market was offset by weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles remain at record high levels.
Automotive Volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures, and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment.Consistent with the overall automotive market, volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically.
Other Rail Revenue The change is primarily due to increased shipments by the Companys regional railroads and more transloading activities associated with ethanol shipments.
Rail Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses for 2007 increased $387 million to $6.7 billion compared to the prior year.The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below.
Labor and Fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs.These expenses are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned, healthcare plan costs, and pension and other post-retirement plan expenses.These expenses increased $57 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation, which was partially offset by improved productivity and reduced staffing levels.
Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities.This category also includes costs related to personal injury claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, non-locomotive fuel, property and sales taxes and professional services.Overall, materials, supplies and other expenses increased by $85 million in 2007 primarily due to inflation, higher train accident related costs and higher environmental costs.These costs were partially offset by $99 million of favorable personal injury reserve adjustments during the year, which were based on managements review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm.
This was due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003.
41 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life.This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year.This expense increased $30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies.
Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel.This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities.This expense increased $98 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and prior year hedge benefits that were not repeated during 2007 due to the expiration of the fuel hedge program.
Equipment and Other Rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment.This category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $36 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases.
Inland Transportation expense included in the rail segment is for amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for shipments on CSXTs network.These intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results.
Gain on Insurance Recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina.While gains were recognized in both years, the $139 million decrease for 2007 was due to higher cash receipts for lost profits and replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged in 2006 versus 2007.
42 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2007 vs. 2006 Intermodal Results of Operations Intermodal operating income declined 3% or $8 million versus last year on 4% lower revenue, partially offset by volume related cost savings.Revenue and volume decreases reflect losses of several International customers, the slowing of Asian imports throughout the year and mix impact related to growth in new short-haul domestic traffic.Other revenue declined $22 million from the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers as well as lower general business levels. Revenue per unit declined slightly with yield gains in the international market being offset by mix changes related to the new short-haul domestic traffic.
Despite rising fuel costs, Intermodal operating expense declined $48 million or 4% driven by lower car hire expense related to volume and improved operational efficiency.Additionally, depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives.

44 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2006 vs. 2005 Rail Results of Operations Rail Operating Revenue CSXT categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Revenue for CSXT increased $898 million, or 12%, to $8.2 billion in 2006 from a year ago. Continued yield management and fuel surcharge were the primary drivers of revenue per unit gains.
Merchandise Chemicals Revenue and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing environment.Overall volume was down slightly because high raw material costs continued to negatively affect the U.S. chemical industrys competitiveness and in turn, CSXT volumes.
Emerging Markets Growth was driven by increased shipments of municipal waste, military, and aggregate products (which include rocks and sand). Revenue per unit also improved due to strong pricing actions.
Forest Products Shipment of building products and printing paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media conversion.However, revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a favorable pricing environment.
Agriculture Products Strong domestic demand in feed grain, soybean, ethanol, and export shipments supported volume and revenue per unit. In addition, strong export demand for grain and increased shipments of beans helped volume growth.
Metals Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains and fuel surcharge coverage. Volume increased slightly driven by strong steel demand in the energy and non-residential construction end-markets. These gains were partially offset by lower demand for steel in the automotive sector.
Phosphates and Fertilizers Volume declined from lower export shipments due to increased international phosphate production which caused several domestic phosphate plants to close.Favorable mix coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue per unit.
Food and Consumer Volume growth in alcoholic beverages, canned goods, and rice and beans was offset by softness in building products, perishables, and the appliance markets.Strong pricing actions, and a focus on longer, more profitable shipments increased revenue and revenue per unit.
45 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Coal Revenue and volume improvements were due to increased shipments of utility and export coal.Utility companies built up their inventories which was a major contributor to CSXs volume growth.Revenue per unit increased due to the continued favorable pricing environment and increased fuel surcharge coverage.
Automotive Volume declined due to a reduction in North American light vehicle production.Consistent with the overall automotive market, CSXTs volumes continued to shift from the Big 3 to foreign brands produced domestically.Revenue per unit was favorable due to price increases and fuel surcharge.
Rail Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses for 2006 increased $341 million, or 6%, to $6.3 billion compared to the prior year.The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below.
Labor and Fringe increased $63 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and increased staffing in rail operations.
Materials, Supplies and Other expenses increased by $113 million in 2006 primarily due to materials inflation, along with prior year casualty favorable adjustments and supplier reimbursements that were not repeated.These costs were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations, such as efficient use of locomotives.
Depreciation expense increased $39 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending.
Fuel expense increased $329 million primarily due to reduced hedge benefit from the expiration of the fuel hedge program as well as higher fuel prices.
Equipment and Other Rents expense decreased $18 million due mainly to improvement in operational fluidity, which drove improvements in asset utilization.
Gain on Insurance Recoveries was $166 million for 2006, which represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged, after consideration of the Companys insurance deductible expensed in 2005.
46 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2006 vs. 2005 Intermodal Results of Operations Intermodal operating income increased 8% or $20 million versus last year driven by revenue gains of $50 million along with expense containment.The increase in revenue and revenue per unit was driven by the continued yield management emphasis which was partially offset by mix of traffic. Volume increased slightly due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from Asia as well as the strength in the truckload market offset by weaker demand in services sold to transportation brokers (known as wholesale markets).
Intermodal operating expense increased $30 million primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs that are reflected in inland transportation expense.Fuel costs were higher due to rising market prices.Partially offsetting the increase in fuel were efficiency gains related to equipment utilization.
47 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is a companys ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned operational growth.In order to have a complete picture of a companys liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed.
Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets CSXs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSXs balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes reinvestment in the Companys existing infrastructure, investments in the future, share repurchases and dividends.
Long-term debt increased $1.1 billion to $6.5 billion due to debt issuances in 2007 of $2.4 billion partially offset by the conversion of a portion of convertible debt into CSX common stock and the reclassification of debt from long-term to current.See the Schedule of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments on page 50 and Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements, for additional details.
Other capital decreased $1.4 billion to $37 million as a result of significant share repurchase activity partially offset by stock option exercises and the conversion of a portion of convertible debt into CSX common stock.For additional information on the Companys share repurchase activity, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.
Sources and Uses of Cash CSX has multiple sources of cash.First, the Company generates cash from operations.In 2007, CSX generated $2.2 billion of cash from operating activities, which represented a $126 million increase from the prior year.Second, CSX has numerous financing sources including access to the capital markets and a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2012.This facility can be increased by an additional $500 million to $1.75 billion with the approval of the lending banks.See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information.
CSX also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSXs discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.
48 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Among other things, CSX uses cash for significant annual reinvestment in infrastructure and equipment, share repurchases and scheduled payments of debt and leases with manageable near-term maturities.The Companys cash requirements also include dividends to shareholders.
During 2007, net cash used by investing activities was $1.7 billion.This use of funds was predominately driven by property additions and capital expansion projects made by the Company.Net cash used in financing activities was $584 million due to over $2 billion of cash used for share repurchases during 2007, largely offset by a net increase in long-term debt issued versus long-term debt repaid.
Dividend payments are another use of cash.The Company paid dividends of $231 million in 2007, which was $86 million more than prior year.The increase in 2007 was primarily due to the Company increasing quarterly dividends to $0.15 per share.
Working Capital Working capital can be considered a measure of a companys ability to meet its short-term needs.CSX had a working capital deficit at December 2007 of $180 million compared to a surplus of $150 million last year driven by lower cash and higher current debt balances in 2007.The larger current debt balance includes a reclassification of outstanding convertible debt with a face value of $174 million from long-term to current during 2007. This reflects bondholders rights under the convertible debt to require CSX to purchase the debentures in October 2008 in lieu of the later maturity date.
A working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due.CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including the revolving line of credit and shelf registration, to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations.
Credit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity.The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy.The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings.The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA+ and Aaa1 for S&P and Moodys, respectively.
49 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Long-term ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moodys, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade.Currently, the long-term ratings for CSXs obligations, along with the other large U.S. Class 1 freight railroads, fall within the investment grade band of credit quality.
In 2007, S&P and Moodys both lowered their ratings of CSX's long-term unsecured debt obligations from BBB and Baa2, respectively, to BBB- and Baa3, respectively.This was due to the Companys announcement in second quarter 2007 of a plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of CSX stock in addition to the $2 billion repurchase plan announced earlier in 2007. Both of these agencies indicate their outlook is Stable and these ratings continue to be investment grade. CSX maintained these credit ratings through December 2007 and does not expect that this reduction in credit ratings will materially increase its borrowing costs or materially affect its liquidity. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience more significant increases in its interest cost for new debt.In addition, the markets demand, and thus the Companys ability to readily issue new debt, could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment.
Schedu le of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other commitments: Type       of Obligation 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (Dollars       in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations: Long-term       Debt (See Note 9) $       785 $       305 $       92 $       591 $       493 $       4,989 $7,255 Operating       Leases - Net (See Note 7) 98 90 79 69 51 181 568 Agreements       with Conrail (a) 14 13 9 4 3 9 52 Purchase       Obligations (See Note 7) 621 549 326 285 288 4,773 6,842 Total       Contractual Obligations $1,518 $957 $506 $949 $835 $9,952 $14,717 Other       Commitments: Guarantees       (See Note 7) 15 16 16 13 12 - 72 Other 53 2 - - - 41 96 Total       Other Commitments $68 $18 $16 $13 $12 $41 $168 (a) Represents minimum future       lease payments for freight cars and locomotives and is included in total       lease commitments disclosed in Note 7, Commitments and       Contingencies.
50 Table of Contents PART II CSX CORPORATION Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements For detailed information about the Companys guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Critica l Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis.Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:  casualty,       environmental and legal reserves;  pension       and post-retirement medical plan accounting;  depreciation       policies for assets under the group-life method;   and  income taxes Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves Casualty Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims.Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Companys self-insured retention amount.To the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, CSX would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries.Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5).These reserves fluctuate with estimates provided by independent third parties reviewed by management, and are offset by the timing of payments.Most of the claims were related to CSXT unless otherwise noted.
51 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. The Company is presently self-insured for personal injury and occupational-related claims.
Personal Injury Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries.Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA).In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.
CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases.An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXTs historical claims and settlement experience.Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.
Based on managements review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $99 million during 2007.This reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003.The analyses further indicated an absence of large catastrophic claims since 2003, which also was determined to be a trend.These reductions were included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements.
Occupational Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.
Asbestos The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace.The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985.Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business.
52 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Companys claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management.The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years.Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty.
The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Key elements of the assessment include the following:  An       estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national       employment for select years during the period 1938-2001.The       Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not       have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of       potentially exposed employees.
The       projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological       studies using employees age and the duration and intensity of potential       exposure while employed.Epidemiology is the medical science       that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a       population.
An       estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease       (non-malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Companys       average historical claim filing rates for a three-year calibration period,       excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia.In       2006, the Company received 852 asbestos claims in West Virginia in which       the claimants were neither exposed in West Virginia nor residents of the       state.CSX believes these claims will not have merit as       no medical evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims and       therefore CSX has excluded them from the calibration       period.Claim levels in 2007 returned to expected levels and       management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of       future filing rates.
An       estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is       computed using the Companys historical average dismissal rates observed       during the current calibration period noted   above.
53 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II  An       estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is       computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim       for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of       incident observed during the current calibration period noted       above.
From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represented claims that were closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Companys future liability for IBNR asbestos claims.
The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve.A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims.
Other Occupational The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Companys claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management.Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the following:  An       estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational       diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from       2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad       employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003       report.
An       estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury,       employee type, and active versus retired employee is computed using the       Companys average historical claim filing rates for the calibration       periods management felt were representative of future filing       rates.For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the       current calibration period is a 1-year average of claim       filings.Hearing loss uses a 3-year calibration period, and all       other diseases or injuries use a 2-year calibration period.An       estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by       disease and the active and retired CSX population each     year.
54 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II  An       estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is       computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim       for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of       injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of       future settlement amounts.
The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve.A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims.
Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites, many of which were, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, or similar state statutes.Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations.However, a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal.In addition, some of the Companys land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.
In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct.These costs could be substantial.
In accordance with Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities , the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least once a quarter, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:  type       of clean-up required;  nature       of the Companys alleged connection to the location (e.g. generator of       waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the   site); 55 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II  extent       of the Companys alleged connection (e.g. volume of waste sent to the       location and other relevant factors); and  number,       connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRPs at the       location.
Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable.The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the Company's estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries.
Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies.In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated.Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Legal In accordance with SFAS 5, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it isprobable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred.
The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above.The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards.
56 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel.The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement.For employees hired after December 31, 2002, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.CSX made pension plan contributions of $266 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2007.
In addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met.The post-retirement medical plan is contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually.The life insurance plan is non-contributory.
The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) ( SFAS 158 ), SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), and SFAS 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension (SFAS 106).
SFAS 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:  long-term       rate of return on plan assets;  discount       rates used to measure future obligations and interest     expense;  salary       scale inflation rates;  health       care cost trend rates; and  other       assumptions.
These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year.As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post-retirement plans.As required by SFAS 158, CSX will change its measurement date to the fiscal year end in 2008 and does not expect the impact to be material. The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the long-term rate of return, discount, salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate.
57 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment.
The Company's expected long-term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds.Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets.As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting.The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its 2007 pension obligation was 8.5%.
Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense.Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Companys expected future benefit payments.The Company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans expected benefit payments.
The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2007 pension and post-retirement obligations are 6% and 5.75%, respectively.The Company uses a different discount rate for pension and post-retirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans.For pensions, the time horizon is approximately 12 years, while for post-retirement, the time horizon is approximately 8 years.
Each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates.If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.
Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company.The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates.The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.1% to value its 2007 pension obligation.
58 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Health Care Cost Trend Rates Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends.The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components).The current assumed health care cost trend rate is 10% for Medicare-eligible participants and 9% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 4.75% in 2014, based upon current actuarial projections.
Other Assumptions The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age.These assumptions are based upon historical data and are approved by management.
2007 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately $34 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to $64 million and $25 million, respectively in 2007.
The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2008 estimated pension and post-retirement expense: (Dollars       in Millions) Pension OPEB Discount       Rate 0.25% change $4 $1 Salary       Inflation 0.25% change 2 - Health       Care Cost 1% change N/A 2 Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group-Life Method CSXT accounts for its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method.The group-life method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole.Under the group-life method, the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management's assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties.These life studies are conducted by a third party expert, analyzed by the Company's management and approved by the STB.Life studies for equipment assets are required every three years, whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the STB.
59 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations.Factors taken into account during the life study include:  Statistical       analysis of historical retirements for each group of     property;  Evaluation       of current operations;  Evaluation       of technological advances and maintenance   schedules;  Previous       assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued       use;  Expected       net salvage to be received upon retirement; and  Comparison       of assets to the same asset groups with other   companies.
The life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study.
In 2007, CSXT completed life studies for all of its equipment, road and track assets and also completed an analysis of the assets received in the Conrail reorganization, which resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense for equipment and road assets and an increase in depreciation expense for track assets.The combination of these adjustments reduced depreciation expense by $21 million in 2007.Also in 2007, the Company reviewed the useful lives of Intermodal terminal assets, as well as lift equipment and containers.A $4 million reduction in depreciation expense was recognized as a result of this periodic review.
Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 91% of CSXT's total fixed assets of $21 billion on a net basis at December 28, 2007. The Companys depreciation expense for the year ended December 28, 2007 amounted to $883 million.A one percent change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an $8 million change to the Companys annual depreciation expense.
60 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Income Taxes In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN 48, which became effective for CSX beginning in 2007.FIN 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.Under FIN 48, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.The Companys reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries.Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2003.Federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2007 currently are under examination.Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed.While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of CSX.An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.Also, the Company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.
New Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting Policy See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption, New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs, but as of December 2007, the Company did not have a significant position in derivative financial instruments.
At December 2007, CSX had $106 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding.A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a $1 million change in interest expense.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 67 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations CSX Corporation (CSX and together with its subsidiaries, the Company), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies.Surface Transportation, which includes the Companys rail and intermodal businesses, provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers.
Rail CSXs principal operating company, CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), provides a crucial link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000 route mile rail network, which serves every major population center in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It serves 70 ocean, river and lake ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 230 short-line and regional railroads.
Other Entities In addition to CSXT, the rail segment includes Total Distribution Services, Inc. (TDSI), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (Transflo), CSX Technology, Inc. (CSX Technology) and other subsidiaries. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations, while Transflo provides logistical solutions for transferring products from rail to trucks. Technology and other support services are provided by CSX Technology and other subsidiaries.
Intermodal CSX Intermodal, Inc. (Intermodal), one of the nations largest coast-to-coast intermodal transportation providers, is a stand-alone, integrated intermodal company linking customers to railroads via trucks and terminals.Containers and trailers are loaded and unloaded from trains, and trucks provide the link between intermodal terminals and the customer.
Surface Transportation Businesses The rail and intermodal segments are designated by the Company on a combined basis as Surface Transportation businesses.Together, they generated $10 billion of revenue during 2007 and served four primary lines of business, which are as follows: 68 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued  The       merchandise business is the most diverse market with nearly 2.7 million       carloads per year of aggregate, which includes crushed stone, sand and       gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer, agricultural, paper       and chemical products.The merchandise business generated       approximately 50% of the Companys revenue in 2007 and 38% of       volume.
Coal,       which delivered approximately 1.9 million carloads of coal, coke and iron       ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers       and terminals, steel makers and industrial plants, accounted for       approximately 26% of the Companys revenue and volume in       2007.The Company transports almost one-third of every ton of       coal used for generating electricity in the areas served by       CSX.
Automotive,       which delivers both finished vehicles and auto parts, generated 8% of the       Companys revenue in 2007 and 6% of the Companys volume.The       Company delivers approximately one-third of North Americas light       vehicles, serving both traditional manufacturers and the increasing number       of global manufacturers.
Intermodal       offers a competitive cost advantage over long-haul trucking by combining       the superior economics of rail transportation with the short-haul       flexibility of trucks. Through its network of more than 50       terminals, Intermodal serves all major markets east of the Mississippi and       transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing       customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.For       2007, Intermodal accounted for approximately 14% of the Companys total       revenue and 30% of volume.
Other revenue, which includes revenue from regional railroads (that are partially owned by CSX), demurrage, switching and other incidental charges, accounted for 2% of the Companys total 2007 revenue.Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by railroads that CSX does not directly operate.Demurrage represents charges assessed by railroads when shippers or receivers of freight hold railcars beyond a specified period of time.Switching revenue is generated when CSXT switches cars between trains for a customer or another railroad.
Other Businesses CSXs other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the Companys real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities, and CSX Hotels, Inc., a resort doing business as The Greenbrier, located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.Pretax earnings of $42 million, $24 million and $85 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from these activities are classified as a component of other income.These items are classified in other income because they are not considered by the Company to be operating activities and may fluctuate with the timing of real estate sales and resort seasonality.
69 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued The Company also has certain residual activities from formerly owned companies that include leasing of equipment and vessels.These results are included in consolidated operating income and totaled $5 million, $12 million and $1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Basis of Presentation In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position of CSX and its subsidiaries at December 2007 and December 2006, and the Consolidated Statements of Income, Cash Flowsand Changes in Shareholders Equity for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.Certain prior-year data have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation.
Fiscal Year CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.This fiscal calendar allows every quarter to consistently end on a Friday and to be of equal duration (13 weeks).However, to maintain this type of reporting calendar, every sixth or seventh year (depending on the Gregorian calendar and when leap year falls), an extra week will be included in one quarter (a 14-week fiscal quarter) and, therefore, the full fiscal year will have 53 weeks.
Fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 28, 2007, December 29, 2006 and December 30, 2005, respectively.Except as otherwise specified, references to full year indicate CSXs fiscal periods ended on these dates.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include results of operations of CSX and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Most investments in companies that were not majority-owned were carried at cost (if less than 20% owned and the Company has no significant influence) or equity (if the Company has significant influence).
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments On a daily basis, cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in various highly liquid investments having a typical maturity date of three months or less at the date of acquisition. These investments were carried at cost, which approximated market value, and were classified as cash equivalents. Investments in instruments with maturities greater than three months but less than one year were classified as short-term investments.
70 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued CSX holds $270 million and $391 million of auction rate securities and classifies these investments as available for sale as of December 2007 and 2006, respectively.Accordingly, these investments were included in current assets as Short-term Investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.On the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements, purchases and sales of these assets were classified within Investing Activities.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated probable losses on uncollectible accounts and other receivables. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of customers, historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions, as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility. Uncollectible amounts were charged against the allowance account. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted against accounts receivable.
Materials and Supplies Materials and Supplies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were carried at average costs and consist primarily of fuel and parts used in the repair and maintenance of CSXTs freight car and locomotive fleets, equipment and track structure.
Properties All properties were stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated depreciation. Rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, were depreciated using the group-life method.Under this method, CSXT pools similar assets by road and equipment type and then depreciates each group as a whole.Regulations enforced by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the U.S. Department of Transportation require periodic formal studies of ultimate service lives (life studies) for all railroad assets. Factors taken into account during a life study include:  statistical       analysis of historical retirements for each group of     property;  evaluation       of current operations;  evaluation       of technological advances and maintenance   schedules;  previous       assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued       use;  net       salvage expected to be received upon retirement;   and  comparison       of assets to the same asset groups with other   companies.
71 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued The results of the life study process determine the service lives for each asset group under the group-life method. These studies are conducted by a third party expert and are analyzed by the Company's management. Resulting changes in service life estimates are subject to review and approval by the STB. Road assets, including main-line track, have estimated service lives ranging from six years for system roadway machinery to 80 years for grading. Equipment assets, including locomotives and freight cars, have estimated service lives ranging from six years for motor vehicles to 35 years for work equipment.
Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies are applied at the completion of the life study and continue until the next required life study. The life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) amount is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study.
The majority of non-rail property is depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis.The depreciable lives of non-rail property is periodically reviewed by the Company and any changes are applied on a prospective basis.Amortization expense recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation expense on the Consolidated Income Statements.
For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. For retirements or disposals of non-rail depreciable assets, infrequent disposal of rail assets outside the normal course of business and all dispositions of land, the resulting gains or losses are recognized at the time of disposal. Expenditures that significantly increase asset values or extend useful lives are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to operating expense when the work is performed.
Properties and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or business conditions indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Initial assessments of recoverability are based on estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows associated with an asset or a group of assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .Where impairment is indicated, the assets are evaluated and their carrying amount is reduced to fair value based on undiscounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair value.
Revenue and Expense Recognition The Company recognizes freight revenue using Free-On-Board (FOB) Origin pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 91-9, Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process .The Company uses method (5) in the EITF, which provides for the allocation of revenue between reporting periods based on relative transit time in each reporting period.Expenses are recognized as incurred.
72 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued The certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above are as follows:  revenue       associated with shipments in transit, which are based on historical       freight car movement data as well as average cycle times to move       commodities from their origin to their final destination or       interchange;  future       adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing corrections,       billing discounts, bad debts and allowances for doubtful       accounts;  future       adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are       based on historical cash paid to customers for rate overcharges as a       percentage of total billing; and  incentive-based       refunds to customers, which are primarily based on customers achieving       certain volume thresholds and are recorded as a reduction to revenue on       the basis of managements best estimate of the projected       liability.This estimate is based on historical activity,       current volume levels and a forecast of future   volume.
The Company regularly updates the estimates described above based on historical experience.All other revenue, such as demurrage, switching and other incidental charges are recorded upon completion of the service.
Comprehensive Earnings CSX reports comprehensive earnings (loss) in accordance with SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income , in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.Comprehensive earnings is defined as all changes in shareholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders (i.e. issuance of equity securities and dividends).At December 2007 and 2006, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss consisted primarily of adjustments for pension and other post-retirement liabilities.(See Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans.) Derivative Financial Instruments CSX recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value.(See Note 14, Derivative Financial Instruments.) 73 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy CSX adopted FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. FIN 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on an income tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.Under FIN 48, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.These tax benefits recognized in the financial statements are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.The impact of the Companys reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.(See Note 13, Income Taxes.) In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) (SFAS 158), which changed the accounting rules for reporting and disclosures related to pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans. Companies were required to reflect the funded status of retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. This change was effective for the Company for fiscal year end 2006.The decrease in equity did not have any significant impact on the Companys credit ratios or financing covenants. Pursuant to SFAS 158, the Company will be required to change its September measurement date for the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans assets and obligations to its fiscal year end effective in 2008.
Effective fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)) using the modified-prospective-transition method.Under this method, compensation costs recognized in 2006 and forward include all unvested share-based payments as of the beginning of 2006.Share-based compensation at CSX may include stock options, restricted stock awards, stock issued to CSX directors and CSXs Long-term Incentive Plans.The amount of compensation costs recognized is based upon the estimated grant date fair value method under the Black-Scholes-Merton formula and resulted in the recognition of additional compensation cost from the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to 2003.
The adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not result in a material impact to the Companys Consolidated Income Statement or earnings per share.The Company recorded $3 million in 2006 of additional compensation expense for unvested stock options granted prior to 2003. Compensation costs for all other types of share-based payments were consistently reported for all periods presented.
74 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 1.Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), and the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159).These statements define fair value, provide guidance on fair value measurement and give companies the option to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.CSX does not expect to be materially impacted by these statements.
In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements- An amendment of ARB No. 51 ( S FAS 160).
This statement clarifies that minority interest should be reported as equity on the balance sheet.Additionally, it requires disclosure of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling intereston the face of the income statement. For CSX, SFAS 160 is effective beginning fiscal year 2009 and the Company does not expect to be materially impacted by this statement.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results may differ from those estimates.Critical accounting estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:  casualty,       environmental and legal reserves (see Note 6, Casualty, Environmental and       Other Reserves);  pension       and post-retirement medical plan accounting (see Note 8, Employee Benefit       Plans);  depreciation       policies for assets under the group-life method (see Properties in this       note); and  income       taxes (see Note 13, Income Taxes).
Other Items  Share Repurchases Currently, CSX has purchased $2.1 billion of its outstanding common stock, which represents 50 million shares or about 70% of the $3 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in 2007.CSX intends to complete this repurchase program during 2008.The timing, method, amount of repurchase transactions and the sources of funds to affect any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on their evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. While it is not managements intention, the program could be suspended or discontinued at any time .

76 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 2.Earnings Per Share, continued Basic earnings per share was based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.Earnings per share, assuming dilution, was based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of the following types of potentially dilutive common shares:  convertible       debt;  employee       stock options; and  other       equity awards, which include unvested restricted stock and long-term       incentive awards.
EITF 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share , required CSX to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution.The amount included in diluted earnings per share represents the number of shares that would be issued if all of CSXs convertible debentures were converted into CSX common stock.
When convertible debentures are converted into CSX common stock, the newly-issued shares are included in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on a weighted average basis. During 2007, $375 million of face value convertible debentures were converted into 13 million shares of CSX common stock.No material conversions occurred during 2006.At December 2007, $174 million face value remained outstanding, convertible into 6 million shares.
In 2005, 4.4 million stock options with an average exercise price of $26.55 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution, since their related option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during the period.In 2006 and 2007, no stock options were excluded from the calculation as all stock options were dilutive at that time.

NOTE 4.Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation CSX share-based compensation plans primarily include long-term incentive plans, restricted stock awards, stock options and stock plans for directors.CSX has not granted stock options since 2003.Awards granted under the various plans are determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or, in certain circumstances, by the Chief Executive Officer for awards to management employees other than senior executives.The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors approves awards granted to the Companys non-management directors.
As of December 2007, there were 2,393 current or former employees with stock option grants outstanding under the various plans.Most new stock awards were granted under the authorization provided in the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of December 2007, an additional 12 million shares of stock could be issued under this plan.
SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from income tax deductions in excess of compensation costs to be classified as financing cash flows.This requirement resulted in reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows of approximately $60 million and $59 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), CSX presented all income tax benefits from deductions resulting from compensation costs as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements.
Total pre-tax expense associated with share-based compensation and its related income tax benefit is as follows: Fiscal       Years (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Share-Based       Compensation Expense $73 $45 $39 Income       Tax Benefit 27 17 14 78 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 4.Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation, continued Long-term Incentive Plans The CSX Long-term Incentive Plans were adopted under the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan. The objective of these long-term incentive plans is to motivate and reward key members of management and executives for achieving and exceeding certain strategic initiatives.
In 2007, performance units were granted to certain layers of management under a new long-term incentive plan adopted under the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan.This plan provides for a three-year cycle ending in fiscal year 2009.The key financial target is Surface Transportation operating ratio, which is defined as annual operating expenses divided by revenue of the Companys rail and intermodal businesses and is calculated excluding certain non-recurring items. Grants were made in performance units and are payable in CSX common stock.The payout range for the majority of participants will be between 0% and 200% of the original grant, with each unit being equivalent to one share of CSX stock.The payout for certain senior executive officers is subject to a 20% increase or decrease based upon certain additional pre-established financial targets.This could result in a maximum payout of 240% of the original grant.However, any payout to certain senior executive officers is also subject to a reduction of up to 30% at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based upon Company performance against certain CSX strategic initiatives.Units in the plan have a weighted average grant date fair value of $43.33, which includes the value of both the initial grant and subsequent, smaller grants issued at different prices based on grant date fair value to new or promoted employees not previously included.
In 2006, grants under two long-term incentive plans were made in the form of performance units.One of the plans provided for a two-year cycle ending in fiscal year 2007 and the other plan provided for a three-year cycle ending in fiscal year 2008. The terms for these plans are substantially similar to the 2007 plan.Units in the plans have a weighted average grant date fair value of $36.86, which includes the value of both the initial grant and subsequent, smaller grants at different prices to new or promoted employees not previously included.One of the 2006 plans ended on December 28, 2007, and CSX issued 1.4 million net shares in 2008 as a result of the achievement of performance targets for the two preceding fiscal years, which had a net market value of $58 million.
CSX also issued 1.5 million shares in 2006 related to the expiration of the 2004/2005 long-term incentive plan. The objective of the 2004/2005 plan was to motivate and reward key members of management and executives for achieving and exceeding a two-year modified free cash flow goal, and the award was paid in cash and CSX common stock.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 4.Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation, continued Stock Plan for Directors The Stock Plan for Directors, approved by the shareholders in 1992, governs in part the manner in which directors' fees and retainers were paid.At the end of 2007, the minimum retainer to be paid in CSX common stock was 50% of the annual retainer, but each director may elect to receive the entire retainer and fees in CSX common stock.In addition, each director receives an annual payment made entirely in CSX common stock. The following table provides information about shares issued to directors.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 5.Hurricane Katrina In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage to Company assets on the Gulf Coast including damage to track infrastructure and bridges.Operations were returned to pre-hurricane conditions by the end of the first quarter of 2006.
In order to determine the proper accounting treatment for the damage, the Company reviewed EITF 01-10, Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 , specifically Issue 3, of that consensus, in which the Task Force concluded that insurance recoveries in connection with property and casualty losses should be recognized when realization of the claim for recovery of a loss recognized in the financial statements is deemed probable.Information regarding the Companys insurance coverage at that time, damage estimates and the allocation of the insurance deductible is as follows: Insurance Coverage In 2005, the Company had insurance coverage of $535 million, after a $25 million deductible (per occurrence), for the following types of losses:  Fixed Assets       Damages - CSX is entitled to the current replacement cost of the       damaged assets.The Companys bridges and track damaged by       Hurricane Katrina comprised the majority of these types of       losses.
Business       Interruption - The Company is entitled to recover the increased       costs incurred to allow the Company to continue operations and to minimize       the overall business impact to the Company during the period of       indemnity.These increased costs include rerouting and other       costs.
Lost Profit -       The Company is entitled to recover lost profits, net of associated       expenses, during the period of indemnity. The period of indemnity is       defined in the relevant policies of insurance and extends not only through       the date upon which the railroad network was restored to its original       operations, butfor such additional time as may be required to       restore revenue to the same level as would have existed had no loss       occurred.
The Companys insurance policies do not prioritize coverage based on types of losses.As claims were submitted to the insurance companies, they were reviewed and preliminary payments were received until all losses were incurred and documented.A final payment will be received once the Company and its insurers agree on the total value of the claim.
84 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 5.Hurricane       Katrina, continued Damage Estimates Managements current loss estimate is approximately $450 million.Damages are categorized as follows:  Fixed Asset       Damages - The cost estimate was based on the replacement value of       approximately 39 miles of continuous track, six major bridges, numerous       small bridges, signal and communication damage, locomotive repair and       facilities damaged throughout the region.
Incremental       Expenses - The Companys incremental expenses relate primarily to       rerouting and other costs.Rerouting costs are costs to move       traffic either through alternative locations on the Companys network or       on other railroad lines.Other costs include debris removal,       maintenance on equipment damaged by water, supplies, environmental       expenses, maintenance labor and other various   items.
Lost Profit -       The Company estimated the impact on revenue at a location and       customer-specific level.
Allocation of Deductible The Companys insurance policies required its participation in the first $25 million of each loss event, without regard to the category of the covered losses.Because the Companys insurance policies do not specifically apply the deductible by the types of losses covered, CSX believes it is inconsistent with the form and economic substance of the Companys policies to attribute the entire deductible to a single component of covered losses.Therefore, the Company allocated the $25 million self-insured deductible among the above three categories of losses in proportion to the best estimate of the total ultimate losses eligible for recovery under the Companys insurance policies.
85 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 5.Hurricane Katrina, continued Gain on Insurance Recoveries As of December 2007, the Company has collected $367 million of insurance proceeds and recognized $195 million of pre-tax gains for claims related to Hurricane Katrina.The gains were attributable to recovering amounts in excess of the net book value of damaged fixed assets and to recording recoveries related to lost profits.Additional cash proceeds are expected and will result in future gain recognition.
Details of how the gain was calculated are as follows: Fiscal       Years (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total       Insurance Proceeds $29 $268 $70 Less       Recoverable Losses: Net       book value of fixed asset damage - 1 41 Incremental       expense 2 56 72 Prior       year receivable - 43 - Gain/(Receivable) $27 $168 $(43) Gain contingencies subject to FIN 30, Accounting for Involuntary Conversions of Nonmonetary Assets to Monetary Assets and SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5), were not recognized until the period in which all contingencies were resolved or cash proceeds were received.The insurance recovery for the replacement cost of property damage in excess of book value and the recovery of lost profits were considered to be gain contingencies.Therefore the net gain (after applying the insurance deductible) was deferred until the cash proceeds are/were received.
In measuring the losses incurred in 2005 attributed to Hurricane Katrina, the Company considered the actual losses reflected in the financial statements and the allocable deductible (based on expected total recoveries from insured losses), and recorded a receivable for the difference based on probable insurance recoveries at December 30, 2005.No receivables were recorded at the end of fiscal year 2007 or 2006 because cash proceeds exceeded the net book value of fixed asset damage and incremental expenses that were paid.
86 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 5.Hurricane Katrina, continued Cash Flows Cash proceeds from the insurers are not specific to the types of losses and so, for cash flow presentation, the Company allocated the proceeds ratably among the three types of losses mentioned above.Allocated cash proceeds for lost profits and incremental expenses were classified as operating activities since they related directly to revenue and expenses from operations and were $13 million, $121 million and $29 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.Allocated cash proceeds for fixed asset damage were classified as investing activities since these proceeds had a direct relationship to money the Company spent on property additions to repair the hurricane-damaged assets that were recorded in the same category.Cash proceeds for fixed asset damage were $16 million, $147 million and $41 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves Activity related to casualty, environmental and other reserves is as follows: Casualty Separation Environmental Other (Dollars       in Millions) Reserves Liabilities Reserves Reserves Total Balance       December 31, 2004 $705 $155 $59 $128 $1,047 Charged       to Expense 181 - 32 47 260 Change       in Estimate (38) - - - (38) Payments (173) (34) (20) (78) (305) Balance       December 30, 2005 $675 $121 $71 $97 $964 Charged       to Expense 143 - 20 48 211 Payments (181) (16) (20) (52) (269) Reclassifications (a) - 15 - - 15 Balance       December 29, 2006 $637 $120 $71 $93 $921 Charged       to Expense (b) 141 - 76 79 296 Change       in Estimate (99) - - - (99) Payments (b) (133) (17) (47) (50) (247) Balance       December 28, 2007 $546 $103 $100 $122 $871 (a) The       reclassifications in 2006 were reclassified from Labor and Fringe Benefits       Payable.
(b) Charges       to expense and payments for environmental reserves were higher in 2007       primarily due to clean-up costs associated with an increase in significant       train accidents.
87 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued Casualty, environmental and other reserves were determined to be critical accounting estimates due to the need for significant management judgments. They are provided for in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: December       28, 2007 December       29, 2006 (Dollars       in Millions) Current Long-term Total Current Long-term Total Casualty $157 $389 $546 $172 $465 $637 Separation 16 87 103 20 100 120 Environmental 42 58 100 26 45 71 Other 32 90 122 35 58 93 Total $247 $624 $871 $253 $668 $921 Details with respect to each type of reserve are described below.Actual settlements and claims received could differ.The final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty.Considering the legal defenses available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of management that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.However, should a number of these items occur in the same period, they could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
Casualty Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims.Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Companys self-insured retention amount of $25 million.To the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, CSX would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries.Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5.These reserves fluctuate with independent third party estimates, which are reviewed by management, and the timing of payments.Most of the claims were related to CSXT unless otherwise noted.
Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. The Company is presently self-insured for personal injury and occupational-related claims.
88 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued Personal Injury Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries.Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA).In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.
CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases.An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXTs historical claims and settlement experience.Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.Reserves for personal injury claims were $338 million and $424 million at December 2007 and December 2006, respectively.
During 2007, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $99 million based on managements review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm.This reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003.The analyses further indicated a reduction of large catastrophic claims since 2003, which also was determined to be a trend.These reductions were included in materials, supplies and other in the Consolidated Income Statements.
Occupational Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss.
Reserves for asbestos related claims were $129 million and $121 million at December 2007 and December 2006, respectively.Reserves for all other occupational claims were $79 million and $92 million at December 2007 and December 2006, respectively.
89 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued Asbestos The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace.The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985.Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned international container shipping business.
The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Companys claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management.The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years.Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty.
The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its potentially exposed population and is then able to calculate the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Key elements of the assessment include the following:  An       estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national       employment for select years during the period 1938-2001.The       Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not       have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of       potentially exposed employees.
The       projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological       studies using employees age and the duration and intensity of potential       exposure while employed.Epidemiology is the medical science       that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a       population.
90 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued  An       estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease       (non-malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Companys       average historical claim filing rates for a three-year calibration period,       excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia.In       2006, the Company received 852 asbestos claims in West Virginia in which       the claimants were neither exposed in West Virginia nor residents of the       state.CSX believes these claims will not have merit as       no medical evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims and       therefore CSX has excluded them from the calibration       period.Claim levels in 2007 returned to expected levels and       management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of       future filing rates.
An       estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is       computed using the Companys historical average dismissal rates observed       during the current calibration period noted   above.
An       estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is       computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim       for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of       incident observed during the current calibration period noted       above.
From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates were applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represented claims that were closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Companys future liability for IBNR asbestos claims.
The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve.A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims.
Undiscounted liabilities recorded related to asbestos claims were as follows: December       28, December       29, (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 2006 Asbestos: Incurred       but not reported claims 54 52 Asserted       claims 75 69 Total       liability 129 121 Current       liability 15 30 91 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued In 2005, management updated its estimate of the IBNR liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists, which resulted in recognition of a $48 million favorable change associated with asbestos liabilities (a net $38 million favorable change for all occupational liabilities).During 2004 and 2005, asbestos related disease claims filed against the Company dropped substantially, particularly bulk claims filed by certain law firms.In 2003, the Company received a significant number of filings.The Company believes the high 2003 number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new, more restrictive venue law took effect in West Virginia in mid-2003.As a result, management reassessed the calibration period from a four-year average to a three-year average in 2005, excluding the surge in claims originating in West Virginia.Management believes this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates.There have been no changes to the number of years used in the calibration period since 2005.
Other Occupational The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Companys claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management.Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the following:  An       estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational       diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from       2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad       employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003       report.
An       estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury,       employee type and active versus retired employee is computed using the       Companys average historical claim filing rates for the calibration       periods management felt were representative of future filing       rates.For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the       current calibration period is a 1-year average of claim       filings.Hearing loss uses a 3-year calibration period, and all       other diseases or injuries use a 2-year calibration period.An       estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by       disease and the active and retired Company population each       year.
92 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued  An       estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is       computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim       for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of       injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of       future settlement amounts.
The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve.A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims.
Undiscounted recorded liabilities related to other occupational claims were as follows: December       28, December       29, (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 2006 Other       Occupational: Incurred       but not reported claims 47 53 Asserted       claims 32 39 Total       liability 79 92 Current       liability 29 30 Summary A summary of asbestos and other occupational claims activity is as follows: Fiscal       Years 2007 2006 Asserted       Claims Open       Claims - Beginning of Year 11,116 10,639 New       Claims Filed 930 1,504 Claims       Settled (553) (767) Claims       Dismissed (505) (260) Open       Claims - End of Year 10,988 11,116 93 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued Approximately 6,000 of the open claims at December 2007 were asbestos claims against CSXs previously owned international container shipping business.Because these claims were against multiple vessel owners, the Companys reserves reflect its portion of those claims.The Company had approximately $9 million reserved for these shipping business claims at December 2007 and 2006.The remaining open claims were asserted against CSXT.
Separation Separation liabilities provide for the estimated costs of implementing workforce reductions, improvements in productivity and certain other cost reductions at the Company's major transportation units since 1991. These liabilities are expected to be paid out over the next 15 to 20 years from general corporate funds and may fluctuate depending on the timing of payments and associated taxes.
Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites, many of which were, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, or similar state statutes.Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations.However, a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal.In addition, some of the Companys land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.
In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct.These costs could be substantial.
94 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued In accordance with Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities , the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least once a quarter.Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable.The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the Company's estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries.Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years.
Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies.In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated.Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Other Other reserves of $122 million and $93 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, include liabilities for various claims, such as longshoremen disability claims, freight claims and claims for property, automobile and general liability.These liabilities are accrued at the estimable and probable amount in accordance with SFAS 5.
Longshoremen disability claims represent liability for assessments under Section 8f of the United States Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program.These reserves have amounts accrued for second injury fund liabilities, which represent the non-medical portion of employee claims which are paid by the United States Department of Labor and are attributed to an earlier injury to the same employee.
Freight claims represent claims for both freight loss and damage and freight rate disputes.Freight loss and damage claims are liabilities that resulted from the loss or damage of customer freight while being handled by the Companys transportation services.Freight rate disputes represent liabilities for customer claims regarding the rate charged by the Company for its transportation services.Liabilities for freight rate disputes are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
95 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 6.Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued The Company accrues for claims related to property, automobile and general liability as noted above.The Company is also required to maintain primary and state mandated coverage for Company property and vehicle fleets.General liability is coverage for liability arising from operations of non-rail CSX subsidiaries.
NOTE 7.Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments The Company has various lease agreements with other parties with terms up to 30 years. Non-cancelable, long-term leases generally include provisions for maintenance, options to purchase and options to extend the terms.
At December 2007, minimum building and equipment rentals and commitments for vessels under these operating leases were as follows: (Dollars       in millions) Operating Sublease Net       Lease Years Leases Income Commitments 2008 $160 $48 $112 2009 140 37 103 2010 119 31 88 2011 90 17 73 2012 75 21 54 Thereafter 264 74 190 Total $848 $228 $620 Operating leases and an equal portion of sublease income include approximately $171 million relating to ongoing operating lease commitments for vessels and equipment, which have been subleased to Horizon Lines, Inc. (Horizon), a former subsidiary previously named CSX Lines.CSX believes Horizon will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to such leases and CSX will have no further liability for those obligations.
In addition to the commitments in the table, the Company also has agreements covering equipment leased from Conrail Inc. (Conrail).
Fiscal       Years (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Rent       Expense on Operating Leases $451 $514 $523 Rent expense on operating leases included $310 million, $355 million and $384 million of net daily rental charges on railroad operating equipment in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are not long-term commitments.The Company uses the straight-line method to recognize rent expense associated with operating leases that include escalations over their terms.
96 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 7.Commitments and Contingencies, continued Purchase Commitments CSXT has a commitment under a long-term maintenance program that currently covers 43% of CSXTs fleet of locomotives. The agreement is based on the maintenance cycle for each locomotive.Under CSXTs current obligations, the agreement will expire no earlier than 2028 and may last until 2031 depending upon when certain locomotives are placed in service. The costs expected to be incurred throughout the duration of the agreement fluctuate as locomotives are placed into, or removed from, service or as required maintenance schedules are revised. CSXT may terminate the agreement at its option after 2012, though such action would trigger certain liquidated damages provisions.
The following table summarizes CSXTs payments under the long-term maintenance program: Fiscal       Years (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Amounts       Paid $217 $183 $170 As a result of agreements executed in August 2005 and February 2006, CSXT has purchase obligations related to a multi-year plan to acquire additional locomotives between 2006 and 2011. The amount of the ultimate purchase commitment depends upon the model of locomotive acquired and the timing of delivery.Annual payments related to the locomotive purchase obligations, including amounts that would be payable under the long-term maintenance program were estimated as follows: Payments (Dollars       in Millions) 2008 446 2009 423 2010 258 2011 266 2012 275 Thereafter 4,773 Total $6,441 97 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 7.Commitments and Contingencies, continued Additionally, the Company has various other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services from various suppliers.Total annual payments under all of these additional purchase commitments were estimated as follows: Payments (Dollars       in Millions) 2008 $175 2009 126 2010 68 2011 19 2012 13 2013       - 2031 - Total $401 Insurance The Company maintains numerous insurance programs, most notably for third-party casualty liability and for Company property damage and business interruption, with substantial limits. A specific amount of risk is retained by the Company on each of the casualty and property programs. Specifically, the Company has a $25 million deductible for each of the casualty and non-catastrophic property programs and a $50 million deductible for the catastrophic property program. This deductible only applies to the first event.If an event occurs in excess of the Companys deductible and the Company does not elect to purchase additional insurance coverage, then the deductible for the second covered event will equal the amount of the claim in the first event.
Guarantees CSX and certain of its subsidiaries are contingently liable, individually and jointly with others, as guarantors of approximately $72 million in obligations principally relating to leased equipment, vessels and joint facilities used by the Company in its current and former business operations.Utilizing the Companys guarantee for these obligations allows the obligor to take advantage of lower interest rates and to obtain other favorable terms.Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company that could require CSX or one of its affiliates to make payment to or to perform certain actions for the beneficiary of the guarantee based on another entitys failure to perform.
98 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 7.Commitments and Contingencies, continued At December 2007, the Companys guarantees primarily related to the following:  Guarantee       of approximately $61 million of obligations of a former subsidiary, CSX       Energy, in connection with a sale-leaseback transaction. CSX is, in       turn, indemnified by several subsequent owners of the subsidiary against       payments made with respect to this guarantee. Management does not       expect that the Company will be required to make any payments under this       guarantee for which CSX will not be reimbursed. CSXs obligation for this       guarantee will be completed in 2012.
Guarantee       of approximately $11 million of lease commitments assumed by A.P.       Moller-Maersk (Maersk) for which CSX is contingently liable. CSX       believes Maersk will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to       such lease commitments and CSX will have no further liability for those       obligations.CSXs obligation under this guarantee will be       completed in 2011.
As of December 2007, the Company had not recognized any liabilities in its financial statements in connection with any guarantee arrangements.The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees is the amount of the guarantees themselves.
Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation Since May 2007, at least 28putative class action suits were filed in various federal district courts against CSXT and the four other U.S.-based Class I railroads.The lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations to the effect that the defendants fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws.The suits seek unquantified treble damages (three times the amount of actual damages) allegedly sustained by purported class members, attorneys fees and other relief.All but three of the lawsuits purport to be filed on behalf of a class of shippers that allegedly purchased rail freight transportation services from the defendants through the use of contracts or through other means exempt from rate regulation during defined periods commencing as early as June 2003 and that were assessed fuel surcharges.Three of the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of rail services.
In July 2007, CSXT received a grand jury subpoena from the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General seeking information related to the same fuel surcharges that are the subject of the purported class actions.It is possible that additional federal or state agencies could initiate investigations into similar matters.
99 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 7.Commitments and Contingencies, continued CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices are lawful.Accordingly, CSXT intends to vigorously defend itself against the purported class actions, which it believes are without merit.CSXT cannot predict the outcome of the putative class action lawsuits, which are in their preliminary stages, or of any government investigations, charges or additional litigation that may be filed in the future.Penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, involving both potential criminal and civil liability.CSXT is unable to assess at this time the possible financial impact of this litigation.CSXT has not accrued any liability for an adverse outcome in the litigation.If a material adverse outcome were to occur and be sustained, it could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Other Legal Proceedings In addition to the matter described above, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to environmental matters, FELA claims by employees, other personal injury claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges.Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions.While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
100 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 8. Employee Benefit Plans General The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel.The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement.For employees hired after December 31, 2002, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.
In addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired on or before December 31, 2002 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met.The post-retirement medical plan is contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually.The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

As currently permitted by SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post-retirement plans.Effective fiscal year 2008, under the provisions of SFAS 158, CSX will be required to change the measurement date for pension and post-retirement benefit plans from September 30 to the last day of the Companys fiscal year.
The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects.
101 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 8.Employee Benefit Plans, continued The benefit obligation for these plans represents the liability of the Company for current and retired employees and is affected primarily by the following:  service       cost (benefits attributed to employee service during the       period);  interest       cost (interest on the liability due to the passage of     time);  actuarial       gains/losses (experience during the year different from that assumed and       changes in plan assumptions); and  benefits       paid to participants.
Cash Flows Plan assets are amounts that have been segregated and restricted to provide benefits and include amounts contributed by the Company and amounts earned from invested contributions, net of benefits paid. The Company funds the cost of the post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you go basis. CSX does not expect to make cash contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2008.
Future expected benefit payments are as follows: Expected       Cash Flows (Dollars       in Millions) PensionBenefits Post-retirement       Benefits (a) 2008 $       146 $       45 2009 145 44 2010 148 42 2011 150 41 2012 152 39 Thereafter 789 169 Total $       1,530 $       380 (a)       The post-retirement benefit payments include an estimated annual reduction       of $6 million due to the Medicare Part D   Subsidy.
102 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 8.Employee Benefit Plans, continued Plan Assets The CSX Investment Committee (the Investment Committee), whose members were selected by the CFO and approved by the CEO, is responsible for managing pension plan assets.The Investment Committee utilizes an asset allocation strategy that was developed using asset return simulation in conjunction with projected plan liabilities.The allocation seeks maximization of returns within the constraints of acceptable risks considering the long-term investment horizon.A target allocation of 60% equity and 40% fixed income investments was established.
The distribution of pension plan assets as of the measurement date is as follows: September       30, 2007 September       30, 2006 Percent       of Percent       of (Dollars       in Millions) Amount Total       Assets Amount Total       Assets Common       Stocks $964 60 % $900 60 % Fixed       Income 626 39 598 39 Cash       and Cash Equivalents 17 1 13 1 Total $1,607 100 % $1,511 100 % The Investment Committee provides investment guidelines to both the plans fixed income and equity fund managers.Within the broad asset classes that comprise the plans investments, common stocks were diversified based on allocations to domestic and foreign stocks.Allocations were maintained within 3% of targets.The U.S. stock segment includes style diversification among managers of large and small capitalization stocks.The Investment Committee limits investment by industry sectors, outlines individual stock issuer concentration and monitors the use of derivatives and CSX securities.
Fixed income securities were diversified across fund managers with differing investment styles and were benchmarked to a long duration index.The Investment Committee specifies the types of allowable investments, such as government, corporate and asset-backed bonds, and limits diversification between domestic and foreign investments and the use of derivatives.Additionally, it stipulates minimum credit quality constraints and any prohibited securities.
Individual investments or fund managers were selected in accordance with standards of prudence applicable to asset diversification and investment suitability.Fund investment performance is continuously monitored.Acceptable performance is determined in the context of the long-term return objectives of the fund and appropriate asset class benchmarks.

The consideration paid for these notes totaled $1.2 billion, including a pre-tax charge of $192 million for costs to repurchase the debt which primarily reflects the market value above original issue value.CSX used net cash proceeds from the disposition of its International Terminals business in 2005, along with cash on hand, to finance this repurchase.
Debt Issuance CSX issued a total of $2.4 billion in debt during 2007 as follows: Notes Principal       Amount Issued (Dollars       in Millions) CSXT       6.251% Notes due 2023 (See Note 19) (a) $        381 CSX       5.75% Notes due 2013 400 CSX       6.25% Notes due 2018 600 CSX       5.60% Notes due 2017 300 CSX       6.15% Notes due 2037 700 $       2,381 (a)The CSXT notes are secured by a security interest in certain railroad equipment.
These notes were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under Long-term Debt and may be redeemed by the Company at any time.The net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repurchases of CSX common stock, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, improvements in productivity and other cost reductions at the Company's major transportation units.
Convertible Debentures In October 2001, CSX issued $564 million aggregate principal amount at maturity in unsubordinated zero coupon convertible debentures (the "debentures") due October 30, 2021 for an initial offering price of approximately $462 million.The carrying value of outstanding debentures was $174 million and $473 million, at December 2007 and December 2006, respectively.From their date of issuance, these debentures had accreted (increased) in value at a yield to maturity of 1% per year.On October 30, 2007, the accretion rate was reset to 2.1%.The accretion rate may be reset again in October 2011 and October 2016 to a rate based on five-year United States Treasury Notes minus 2.8%.In no event, however, will the yield to maturity be reset below 1% or above 3% per annum.Accretion in value on the debentures is recorded for each period, but will not be paid prior to maturity.
109 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 9.Debt and Credit Agreements, continued Credit Facilities In 2006, the Company entered into a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility and a $15 million secured revolving credit facility expiring in 2011.In 2007, with the consent of the lenders and in accordance with the facilitys terms, CSX extended the maturity date of the $1.25 billion facility an additional year, to 2012.CSX also has an $18.5 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in August 2008.
Additionally, with the approval of the lending banks, CSX may increase its total borrowing capacity under the $1.25 billion facility by $500 million, from $1.25 billion to up to $1.75 billion.
The facility was not drawn on as of December 2007.Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility were similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers.
In 2007, CSX paid approximately $2 million in total fees associated with the undrawn facilities. These credit facilities allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based) interest rates, plus a spread, depending upon CSXs senior unsecured debt ratings. LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate which is a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds. At December 2007, CSX was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facilities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair values of CSXs financial instruments were estimated by reference to quoted prices from market sources and financial institutions as well as other valuation techniques. Long-term debt is the only financial instrument of CSX with fair values significantly different from their carrying amounts.The fair value of long-term debt has been estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based upon CSX's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of financing arrangements.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 13.Income Taxes, continued The primary factors in the change in year-end net deferred income tax liability balances include:  Annual       provision for deferred income tax expense;  Accumulated       other comprehensive loss and other capital adjustments;   and  The       reclassification of income taxes payable balances as required by FIN       48.
The breakdown of income tax expense (benefit) between current and deferred is as follows: (Dollars       in Millions) Fiscal       Years Current: 2007 2006 2005 Federal $388 $458 $350 State 46 31 12 Total       Current 434 489 362 Deferred: Federal 237 15 33 State 35 27 (79) Total       Current 272 42 (46) Total $706 $531 $316 Income tax expense reconciled to the tax computed at statutory rates is as follows: Fiscal       Years (Dollars       In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Federal       Income Taxes $676 35 % $644 35 % $362 35 % State       Income Taxes 50 3 37 2 (44) (4) Prior       Year Audit Resolutions 5 - (132) (7) (1) - Other       Items (a) (25) (1) (18) (1) (1) (1) Income       Tax Expense/Rate $706 37 % $531 29 % $316 30 % (a)       Other items primarily include tax impacts from equity in Conrail and other       partially owned subsidiaries earnings.
The change in the 2007 effective income tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to prior year audit resolutions favorably impacting the 2006 effective rate. The net state income tax impact of the 2006 resolutions of federal income tax audits of $15 million is included on the 2006 state income taxes line above.The state income tax benefit in 2005 is largely due to the recognition of an income tax benefit of $71 million for the Ohio legislative change to gradually eliminate its corporate franchise tax.
115 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 13.Income Taxes, continued CSX adopted FIN 48, at the beginning of fiscal year 2007.As a result of the implementation, the Company recognized a $31 million decrease to reserves for uncertain tax positions.This decrease, along with a $2 million reduction for unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method of accounting, was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet.
The change to the total gross unrecognized tax benefits of the Company during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2007 is reconciled as follows: Uncertain       Tax Positions: Fiscal       Year (Dollars       in Millions) 2007 Beginning       Balance $       207 Additions       based on tax positions related to current year 1 Settlements       with IRS (148) Lapse       of statute of limitations (2) Balance       at December 28, 2007 $       58 Of the total gross reserve for uncertain tax positions listed above, $197 million (of the beginning balance) and $50 million (of the ending balance) net of federal benefit on state issues could favorably affect the effective tax rate.The annual decrease in unrecognized tax benefits primarily related to settlements with the IRS that resulted in a $110 million discontinued operations benefit (See Note 17, Discontinued Operations).The Company estimates that approximately $17 million of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2007 for various state and federal income tax matters will be resolved over the next 12 months.The final outcome of these uncertain tax positions, however, is not yet determinable.
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. CSX and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions.The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax examinations for years through 2003 and substantially all other income tax matters have been concluded for years through 1998.Federal income tax returns for 2004through 2006 are currently under examination.
CSXs continuing practice is to recognize net interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.Included in the consolidated income statements are $(8) million, $(79) million, and $43 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, of interest and penalties expense/(benefit) for all prior year tax positions.Benefits for interest and penalties are due to favorable tax settlements of prior period tax audits where the Company had previously accrued a liability for interest and penalties.The Company had $4 million and $52 million accrued for interest and penalties for 2007 and 2006 respectively, for all prior year tax positions.The decrease for interest and penalties during both 2007 and 2006 is primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax audits and payments made to the IRS by the Company.
116 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOTE 14.Derivative Financial Instruments CSX uses derivative financial instruments to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and has previously used such instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in fuel costs.
Interest Rate Swaps During 2007, CSX repaid $450 million of debentures that matured and called $150 million of debentures due in 2032 (See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements).As a result, CSX also settled the interest rate swaps related to these debentures.CSX had $35 million and $640 million of outstanding interest rate swaps that impacted interest expense by $2 million for 2007 and 2006.The interest rate swap agreements were designated and qualified as fair value hedges, and the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the fixed rate note attributed to the hedged risk, were recognized in current earnings during the period of change in fair values.CSXs interest rate swaps qualified as perfectly effective fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. As such, there was no ineffective portion to the hedge recognized in earnings during the current or prior year periods.
Fuel Hedging In 2003, CSX began a program to hedge a portion of CSXTs future locomotive fuel purchases. This program was established to manage exposure to fuel price fluctuations. To minimize this risk, CSX entered into a series of swaps.Ineffectiveness, or the extent to which changes in the fair values of the fuel swaps did not offset changes in the fair values of the expected fuel purchases, was immaterial.CSX suspended entering into new swaps in its fuel hedge program in 2004 and there are currently no outstanding contracts.
Fuel hedging activity offset increased fuel expense for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 by $55 million and $249 million, respectively.Since the end of third quarter 2006, there has been no impact on fuel expense as all contracts expired prior to that time.
NOTE 15.Business Segments The Company operates primarily in two business segments: rail and intermodal.The rail segment provides rail freight transportation over a network of approximately 21,000 route miles in 23 states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The intermodal segment provides integrated rail and truck transportation services and operates a network of dedicated intermodal facilities across North America.These segments are strategic business units that offer different services and are managed separately.Performance is evaluated and resources are allocated based on several factors, of which the principal financial measures are business segment operating income and operating ratio.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies.

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.Pursuant to the Accounting Principle Board (APB) Opinion 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail.
Conrail owns and operates rail infrastructure for the joint benefit of CSX and NS.This is known as the shared asset area (shared asset area). Conrail charges fees for right-of way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area.Historically, these expenses were included as an expense category, Conrail rents, fees and services, in the consolidated income statements.Beginning in 2007, these amounts have been included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.
Also included in materials, supplies and other are CSXs 42% share of Conrails income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments.The amortization primarily represents the additional after tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrails fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value.

(SLSI) to Dubai Ports International FZE (DPI) for gross cash consideration of $1.142 billion. Of the gross proceeds, approximately $110 million was paid for the purchase of a minority interest in an International Terminals subsidiary, which the Company acquired during the first quarter of 2005 and divested as part of the sale to DPI. Other related cash transaction costs amounted to approximately $34 million, including resolution of working capital and long-term debt adjustments.
CSX recognized a gain of $683 million pre-tax, $428 million after tax, in fiscal year 2005 as a result of the sale.Consequently, amounts related to this gain and the business were reported as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Income Statement.
SLSI also holds certain residual assets and liabilities as a result of prior divestitures and discontinuances.A wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX retains the rights to those assets and indemnifies DPI, SLSI and related entities against those liabilities pursuant to a separate agreement.CSX guarantees the obligations of its subsidiary under this separate agreement.

Item 9A.Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 28, 2007, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 28, 2007, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in CSXs periodic SEC reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting CSXs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of CSX, including CSXs CEO and CFO, CSX conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007 based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission which is also referred to as COSO. Based on that evaluation, management of CSX concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2007.Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.
The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein.
131 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART III Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CSX Corporation We have audited CSX Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). CSX Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
132 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART III In our opinion, CSX Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2007 consolidated financial statements of CSX Corporation and our report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
