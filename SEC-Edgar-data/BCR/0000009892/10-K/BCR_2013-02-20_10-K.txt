Business General C. R. Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Bard) are engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. Charles Russell Bard founded the company in 1907. In 1923, the company was incorporated as C. R. Bard, Inc. and distributed an assortment of urological and surgical products. Bard became a publicly traded company in 1963 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange five years later. Currently, the company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. In general, Bards products are intended to be used once and then discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company participates in the markets for vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products. Bards product strategy is based on the following tenets, which are designed to position the company for continued growth:  Clinician Preference - Bard targets markets where clinicians drive purchasing decisions based on the benefits a product provides to patients;  Product Leadership - The company pursues opportunities in markets where products that consistently provide superior clinical outcomes and medical economic value can attain a leadership position;  Market Growth - Bard focuses its investments in fast-growing and/or under-served markets;  Competitive Advantage - The company strives to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through product quality and innovation, intellectual property protection and a core competency in managing complex clinical and regulatory requirements; and  Product Diversity - Bard offers a broad, diverse product portfolio to balance the risks inherent in the highly competitive and complex medical device industry.
Bards execution of this strategy has helped the company establish market leadership positions across its four product group categories. In 2012, approximately 82% of the companys net sales were derived from product lines in which the company holds a number one or number two market share position.
Product Group Information The company reports its sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The following table sets forth for the three years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 the approximate percentage contribution by category to Bards consolidated net sales on a worldwide basis.
FortheYearsEndedDecember31, 2012 2011 2010 Vascular 29 % 29 % 28 % Urology 26 % 25 % 26 % Oncology 27 % 27 % 27 % Surgical Specialties 15 % 16 % 16 % Other 3 % 3 % 3 % Consolidated net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % Vascular Products Bards vascular products cover a wide range of minimally invasive devices for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and heart arrhythmias. These products include: percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheters, chronic total occlusion (CTO) catheters, guidewires, fabrics, meshes, introducers and I-1 Table of Contents accessories; peripheral vascular stents, covered stents and vascular grafts; vena cava filters; biopsy devices; and electrophysiology products, including electrophysiology laboratory systems and diagnostic, therapeutic and temporary pacing electrode catheters. Bards low-profile catheter and high-pressure balloon technology has made Conquest  , Atlas  and Dorado  PTA catheters leading choices of clinicians for the treatment of arterial venous access stenosis and other PVDs. In December 2011, Bard acquired Lutonix, Inc., a development stage company specializing in drug coated balloon technology for the treatment and prevention of vascular disease. Bard started selling this device in Europe in 2012 and is conducting the first investigational device exemption trial in the United States. The companys Ultraverse  and VascuTrak  PTA catheters and Crosser  CTO catheter give Bard one of the broadest offerings in the small-vessel segment of the PVD market. Bards line of peripheral vascular stents, covered stents and vascular grafts includes the Flair  AV (arterial venous) Access Stent Graft, E  Luminexx  and LifeStar  Iliac Stents, and the LifeStent  family of stents approved for use in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries. Bards vena cava filters product line includes devices which can be either permanently implanted or retrieved after the threat of blood clots traveling from the lower extremities to a patients lungs has passed. Bard offers a market leading portfolio of automatic core needle biopsy devices including MaxCore  and Magnum  . Bards Vacora  and Finesse  devices combine the benefits of a vacuum-assisted biopsy technology with a portable, self-contained needle system for the diagnosis of breast tumors. In July 2010, the company acquired SenoRx, Inc., adding products such as the EnCor  and EnCor Enspire  breast biopsy systems for ultrasound-, stereotactic- and MRI-guided breast biopsy procedures. This acquisition also added the SenoMark  , StarchMark  and Gel Mark  lines of breast tissue markers to Bards existing UltraClip  line of tissue markers. With SenoRx products, Bard offers a wide variety of products across the percutaneous breast biopsy and tissue marker segments.
Urology Products Bards urology products include basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. The Foley catheter, which Bard introduced in 1934, remains one of the most important products in the urology field. The company has a market-leading position in Foley catheters, including the infection control Foley catheter (Bardex  I.C. Foley catheter), which has been proven to substantially reduce the rate of urinary tract infections. Other urology products include: surgical slings used to treat stress urinary incontinence; fecal incontinence products; devices for the treatment of pelvic floor and vaginal prolapse; brachytherapy services, devices and radioactive seeds used to treat prostate cancer; intermittent urinary drainage catheters, urine monitoring and collection systems; ureteral stents; and specialty devices for stone removal procedures.
The company also markets the proprietary line of StatLock  catheter stabilization devices, which are used primarily to secure peripheral intravenous catheters, thereby reducing restarts and other complications. These devices are also used to secure many other types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies, including Foley catheters. In November 2011, the company acquired Medivance, Inc. whose Arctic Sun  system with proprietary ArcticGel  pads provides Targeted Temperature Management  therapy to patients requiring therapeutic hypothermia.
Oncology Products Bards oncology products cover a wide range of devices used in the treatment and management of various cancers and other diseases and disorders. These include specialty vascular access catheters and ports, vascular access ultrasound devices, dialysis access catheters and enteral feeding devices. The companys specialty vascular access products, used primarily for chemotherapy, serve a well-established market in which Bard holds a leading position. The features and benefits of the companys broad line of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have allowed Bard to capitalize on this important segment of the specialty vascular access market. The companys PowerPICC  catheters and PowerPort  devices can also be used to inject contrast media at high flow rates. These devices eliminate the need to place an additional catheter in the significant number of PICC and port recipients who also require contrast enhanced CT (computed tomography) scans. Bards Site-Rite  vascular access ultrasound device and Sherlock  tip locator system help nurses place a PICC at a patients bedside, making PICCs a more convenient and cost-effective treatment option. The companys 3CG Tip Confirmation System can be used in place of imaging technologies such as x-rays to confirm proper placement of the PICC prior to treatment.
I-2 Table of Contents Surgical Specialty Products Bards surgical specialty products include implanted grafts and fixation devices for hernia and soft tissue repairs. The companys soft tissue repair products consist of hernia repair grafts, including both synthetic and natural-tissue configurations, and hernia fixation devices. Bard has a full line of products for inguinal (groin) hernias including the Perfix  Plug and 3D Max  product lines. Bard also has the Phasix line of products, which includes advanced polymer technology based on a fully absorbable platform that is absorbed naturally by the body over time. The company also markets products for the repair of ventral (abdominal) hernias including the Ventrio  , Ventrio  ST, Ventralex  , Ventralex  ST and Ventralight  ST synthetic grafts. In 2011, the company launched the ECHO PS  Positioning System which helps facilitate mesh deployment in laparoscopic surgical repair. Bards line of natural-tissue products, includes the XenMatrix  and Allomax  grafts used to repair complex ventral hernias and soft tissue reconstruction. Among the companys hernia fixation devices is its SorbaFix  product, a bioresorbable-tack fixation device for use in laparoscopic and open surgical procedures. In 2012, Bard acquired Neomend, Inc., whose Progel  surgical sealant is the only FDA-approved product available for intraoperative sealing of air leaks in connection with thoracic surgery. Progel  has also received a CE mark for both lung sealing and as an anti-adhesion barrier.
International Through subsidiaries and a joint venture, Bard markets its products to customers in over 100 countries outside the United States. The products sold in the international markets include many of the products described above. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the companys international businesses vary with market size and stage of development. The companys principal international markets are currently in Europe and Japan, and the company expects to continue investing to expand sales and marketing resources in order to capitalize on opportunities in other markets, such as certain emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. Generally, the company maintains a geographically-based sales organization that it believes provides greater flexibility in international markets. Approximately 73% of international sales are of products manufactured by Bard in the United States, Puerto Rico or Mexico. For financial reporting purposes, revenues and long-lived assets in significant geographic areas are presented in Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Bards foreign operations are subject to certain financial and other risks, and international operations in general present complex tax and cash management issues. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country. Trade receivable balances outside the United States generally are outstanding for longer periods than in the United States, particularly in Europe. Inventory management is also an important business concern due to the potential for rapidly changing business conditions and currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect income and cash flows of international operations. The company attempts to hedge some of these currency exposures to help reduce the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on the business. For more information, see Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Item1A. Risk Factors included in this Form10-K.
Competition The company competes in therapeutic and diagnostic medical device markets around the world. These global markets are characterized by rapid changes resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. The companys market position depends on its reliable product quality, dependable service, value proposition and ability to develop products to meet evolving market needs. The company faces a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to smaller manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products, and to a lesser extent reprocessors of single-use medical devices. Many of Bards products are patented or are the subject of patent applications. Patent protection also affects the companys market position.
I-3 Table of Contents In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the trend among hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate purchases to enhance purchasing power. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, sales transactions are more complex and tend to involve more significant contracts than in the past. This enhanced purchasing power has placed pressure on product pricing. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Marketing The companys products are distributed domestically directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions, as well as through numerous hospital/surgical supply and other medical specialty distributors with whom the company has distribution agreements. In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country. Full-time representatives of the company in domestic and international markets engage in sales promotion. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end-users, accounted for approximately 36%, 33% and 32% of the companys net sales for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the five largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 65%, 68% and 66%, respectively, of distributors sales for the corresponding years. One large distributor accounted for approximately 9% of the companys net sales in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010.
In order to service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels, the company operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the United States and Europe. Orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt. Backlog is not currently a significant issue for the company.
Most of the products sold by the company, whether manufactured by the company or by others, are sold under the BARD  trade name or trademark and/or other trademarks owned by the company. Products manufactured for the company by outside suppliers are generally produced according to the companys specifications.
Available Information The company makes available, free of charge, on its website located at www.crbard.com , its annual reports to shareholders, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The company has adopted, and has posted on its website, a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to the companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer and controller. To the extent required, the company intends to disclose any amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Ethics on its website. In addition, the companys audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, governance committee charter, corporate governance guidelines and business ethics policy are also posted on the companys website. From time-to-time Bard uses its website to distribute company information, including material information. Financial andotherinformation, including material information regarding the company is routinely posted on and accessible at http://investorrelations.crbard.com . In addition, shareholders or interested parties may enroll to automatically receiveemail alerts and other information about Bard by visiting the Email Alert Service section at http://investorrelations.crbard.com . Shareholders, employees or other interested parties may communicate directly with the Board of Directors, the non-management members of the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The process for doing so is described on the companys website.
Regulation The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the companys products are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States. Government regulation, including detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, I-4 Table of Contents manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping and storage and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions.
Medical device laws are in effect in many of the countries in which the company does business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events are also components of most of these regulatory systems. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing.
For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Healthcare Cost Containment Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures. Difficulty in obtaining coverage, coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years.
Bards products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it can affect the products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Manufacturers such as Bard rely on insurance reimbursement to create favorable markets for their products, while providers depend on this reimbursement to incorporate new products into their medical practices. As the largest single insurer in the United States, Medicare has a profound influence on the healthcare market. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formulates national and local coverage policy and sets payment rates for facilities and physician providers. Additionally, most private payors will follow the lead of CMS when developing their policies and payment rates. Technology assessment organizations, including the one run by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are consulted by public and private payors to evaluate the relative merits of new technologies and their impact on net health outcomes in an effort to get as much value for the healthcare dollar as possible.
The processes necessary for a manufacturer to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement are complex and usually vary from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursements to hospitals and ambulatory care facilities are typically made for procedures or episodes of care, which include the costs of devices, supplies and equipment, and provide an incentive for efficient care and careful use of more expensive technologies.
Third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes. In addition, in an effort to better align incentives for providers, CMS and several large commercial payors have recently adopted policies that will cease to pay for certain preventable, hospital-acquired infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The company believes that the Bardex  IC products are well-positioned to help its customers prevent certain hospital acquired infections. However, the uncertainty and complexity of future legislation seeking to reform the health insurance market and the healthcare delivery system make it difficult to ultimately predict the impact on Bards business.
For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
I-5 Table of Contents Raw Materials The company uses a wide variety of readily available oil-based resins, textiles, alloys and latex materials for the manufacture of its devices. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers. Most of the raw materials are available and/or purchased only from single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, sole-source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Bard works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Environment The company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. The operations of the company, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While the company continues to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, management believes that such compliance will not have a material effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. For more information, see Item3. Legal Proceedings.
Employees The company had approximately 12,200 employees as of December31, 2012.
Seasonality The companys business is not affected to any material extent by seasonal factors.
Research and Development The company is engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its existing products, and to expand the applications for which the uses of its products are appropriate. The company is dedicated to developing and acquiring technologies that will furnish healthcare providers with a more complete line of products to treat medical conditions through less invasive procedures and in a cost-effective manner. The companys research and development expenditures, including acquired in-process research and development, were $203.2 in 2012 and $185.4 million in each of 2011 and 2010. The company evaluates developing technologies primarily in areas where it may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition.
Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to Bards business. The company also relies upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve its competitive position.
The company owns an extensive portfolio of patents and has numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of the companys products. The companys policy is to file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries where rights are available and where the company believes it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. The company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
I-6 Table of Contents Item1A.
Risk Factors An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in evaluating our business. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Defects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts, negative publicity regarding the company and litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely affect our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. Loss reserves are difficult to estimate.
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types we produce entail inherent risks. Quality is extremely important to us and to our customers because our products are often used in clinically demanding circumstances with seriously ill patients, and many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Given the circumstances in which our products are often used, defects, failures or quality issues can result in serious and costly consequences. Quality management is essential to prevent defects or failures associated with our products, as well as to improve our products and maintain the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products.
There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition, injury or death of a patient with respect to products that we manufacture or sell, including quality issues, component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated or improper uses of our products, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information.
Any of these issues could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products and could ultimately result in the removal of these products from the body and claims against us for costs associated with the removal. Any recall, whether voluntary or required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar governmental authorities in other countries, could result in significant costs and significant negative publicity. Negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals and/or harm our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. The foregoing problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits including those being brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class or establish multi-district litigation proceedings. While we believe that many settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, amounts recovered under these policies may be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will be otherwise available. See Item3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits filed or asserted against us, including the Hernia Product Claims, Womens Health Product Claims and Filter Product Claims (each, as defined below). Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture, quality or marketing of our products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals. Any of the foregoing problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Reserves established for estimated losses, including with respect to legal proceedings, do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, actual losses may be materially higher or lower than the related reserve. Liabilities in excess of our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
I-7 Table of Contents We face intense competition from other companies, and our inability to continue to effectively develop, acquire and/or market new products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
The medical device business is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change. Our customers consider many factors when choosing among products, including product features and reliability, product quality, product technology, clinical outcomes, product availability, price and product services provided by the manufacturer. Product introductions, alternative therapies or enhancements by competitors that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value and/or offer lower pricing, may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry and among our customers could result in greater competition and pricing pressures.
As a result, we engage in product development and improvement programs to maintain and improve our competitive position. We may not, however, be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new products or technologies that will achieve regulatory approval or receive market acceptance. As part of our business strategy, we also pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and products. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once a business is acquired, any inability to successfully integrate the business, failure to retain and develop its workforce or failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. If we fail to develop and successfully launch new products, generate satisfactory clinical results, provide sufficient economic value, enhance existing products or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and products, or otherwise compete effectively, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.
Domestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms or other governmental actions in the United States and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.
Major third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers resterilize our products intended for a single use or purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us.
Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the United States and abroad, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. Examples of these reforms or adverse decisions include price regulation, I-8 Table of Contents competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. Any of such reforms or adverse decisions resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices or denials of coverage could have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. These outcomes, along with cost containment measures, could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.
We manufacture our products at facilities located throughout the world, some of which are in areas that are prone to hurricanes and other natural disasters. In some cases, certain of our key products are manufactured at one facility. If an event occurred that resulted in damage to one or more of our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, most components and raw materials are available and/or purchased only from a sole supplier. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost. As a result, a reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
We are subject to a comprehensive system of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and we could be the subject of an enforcement action or face lawsuits and monetary or equitable judgments.
We operate in many parts of the world, and our operations are affected by various state, federal and international healthcare, environmental, antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and employment laws, including, for example, various FDA and international regulations, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act. We are subject to periodic inspections to determine compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation requirements, current medical device adverse event reporting regulations, and foreign rules and regulations. The failure to comply with these laws and regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer: (i)could result in FDA Form-483 notices and/or warning letters, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, detainment, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and/or civil or criminal prosecution, and/or penalties, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims; and (ii)could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market a medical device. Approvals might not be granted for new devices on a timely basis, if at all. Product approvals by the FDA and other foreign regulators can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Regulations are also subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. As an example, the FDA has proposed changes to the 510(k) process, which is the clearance process for medical devices that are substantially equivalent to other legally-marketed devices. If changes to the 510(k) process are adopted, the time and cost to get many of our medical devices to market could increase. Our failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval for new products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
The healthcare industry is under continued scrutiny from state governments and the federal government with respect to industry practices in the area of sales and marketing. If our marketing or sales activities fail to comply with the FDAs regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings from the FDA I-9 Table of Contents or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies. In the recent past, medical device manufacturers have been the subject of investigations from state and federal agencies related to their relationships with doctors, product marketing and off-label promotion of products, among other activities or practices. If an enforcement action involving the company were to occur, it could result in penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. See Item3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of a matter relating to the companys brachytherapy business and for a description of the subpoenas and Civil Investigation Demands from a number of State Attorneys General seeking information related to certain of the companys products.
In addition, lawsuits by employees, customers, licensors, licensees, suppliers, business partners, distributors, shareholders or competitors with respect to how we conduct our business could be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time-to-time with companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve these disputes on terms favorable to us. See Item3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits against the company. The occurrence of an adverse monetary or equitable judgment or a large expenditure in connection with a settlement of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
We are substantially dependent on patent and proprietary rights and incur significant costs maintaining, defending and protecting these rights. We also may face restrictions or additional costs in connection with the sale of our products.
We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation is generally expensive, complex and can result in significant damage awards (treble damages under certain circumstances), injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products, settlement payments or royalty payments to enable us to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business, we believe that an adverse outcome associated with any pending litigation could generally have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. Although these patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements may not successfully protect our intellectual property, we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications may not result in patents issuing to us, and patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and these patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, we operate in foreign markets where protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weaker than in the United States, and inadequate patent protection in those markets may adversely affect our competitive position. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and we cannot assure you that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to protect our intellectual property or obtain necessary licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or liquidity. For more information, see Item3. Legal Proceedings.
Our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
Sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales in 2012. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales, and we intend to accelerate our expansion into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. As a result, our sales and profitability from our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy I-10 Table of Contents (including our plan to expand into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States) are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, and include those related to political and economic conditions (such as those affecting certain countries in Europe), foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
The adoption of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
In March 2010, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA). The PPACA includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose new and/or increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. The company has evaluated the impact of this tax on our overall business. Based on forecasted 2013 annual United States sales, the excise tax is expected to be approximately $40million, which will increase our cost of doing business. Although there are ongoing discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding the medical device excise tax, there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any of these discussions. The PPACA also reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and clinical laboratories, which could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which the company sells its products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, other elements of this legislation, such as Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, make it difficult to determine the overall impact on sales of our products. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The impact of the PPACA and these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
Disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.
We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, track customer purchases, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, including infiltration of data centers, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, and financial results. If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Economic instability could continue to adversely affect the company.
Financial markets and the economies in the United States and internationally may continue to experience disruption and volatility as they have in recent years and conditions could worsen. As a result, the economic environment (including deteriorating economic conditions in certain countries in Europe) may, among other things:  create downward pressure on the pricing of our products; I-11 Table of Contents  affect the collection of accounts receivable in countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and certain other countries in Europe;  increase the sales cycle for certain of our products;  slow the adoption of new technology;  adversely affect our customers, causing them to reduce spending and/or decrease utilization of our products;  adversely affect our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and  limit our access to capital on terms acceptable to us.
These conditions may continue in the future. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

The company owns approximately 2.5million square feet of space in 18 locations and leases approximately 1.4million square feet of space in 71 locations. All of these facilities are well-maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them.
Item3.
Legal Proceedings General In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings, investigations and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time, in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of certain intangible assets on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount. The company believes that any of these proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
I-12 Table of Contents Product Liability Matters As of February14, 2013, approximately 890 federal and 730 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 1,750 plaintiffs, as well as two putative class actions in the United States and four putative class actions in various Canadian provinces, are currently pending against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  and certain other hernia repair implant products (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims). One of the U.S. class action lawsuits consolidated ten previously-filed U.S. class action lawsuits. Theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek (i)medical monitoring, (ii)compensatory damages, (iii)punitive damages, (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v)attorneys fees. A class certification hearing in one of the Canadian class actions is scheduled to take place in May 2013. Approximately 705 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 800 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions. The Hernia Product Claims also generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix  Kugel  products beginning in December 2005.
In June2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) transferred Composix  Kugel  lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The MDL court subsequently determined to include other hernia repair products of the company in the MDL proceeding. On June30, 2011, the company announced that it had reached agreements in principle with various plaintiffs law firms to settle the majority of its existing Hernia Product Claims. Each agreement is subject to certain conditions, including requirements for participation in the proposed settlements by a certain minimum number of plaintiffs. In addition, the company continues to engage in discussions with other plaintiffs law firms regarding potential resolution of unsettled Hernia Product Claims, and intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation. Additional trials are scheduled in the second quarter of 2013 and throughout the remainder of 2013. Based on these events, the company incurred a charge of $184.3 million ($180.6 million after tax) in the second quarter of 2011, which recognized the estimated costs of settling all Hernia Product Claims, including asserted and unasserted claims, and costs to administer the settlements. The charge excludes any costs associated with pending putative class action lawsuits. The company cannot give any assurances that the actual costs incurred with respect to the Hernia Product Claims will not exceed the amount of the charge together with amounts previously accrued. The company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of the Hernia Product Claims that have not settled, including asserted and unasserted claims and the putative class action lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February14, 2013, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,320 plaintiffs have been filed or asserted against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of certain of the companys surgical continence products for women, including its Avaulta  line of products. In addition, five putative class actions in the United States and one putative class action in Canada have been filed against the company (all lawsuits, collectively, the Womens Health Product Claims). The Womens Health Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The putative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)compensatory damages; (iii)punitive damages; (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (v)attorneys fees. With respect to certain of these claims, the company believes that one of its suppliers has an obligation to defend and indemnify the company. In October 2010, the JPML transferred the Womens Health Product Claims involving solely Avaulta  products pending in federal courts nationwide into an MDL for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In February 2012, the JPML expanded the scope of and renamed the MDL pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to include lawsuits involving all womens surgical continence products that are manufactured or distributed by the company. In total, approximately 1,835 of the Womens Health Product Claims are pending in federal courts and have been or will be transferred to the MDL in West Virginia, with the remainder of the Womens Health Product Claims in other jurisdictions. Trial dates have been scheduled in the MDL beginning in June 2013 and are scheduled to continue throughout 2013. Additional trials I-13 Table of Contents are also scheduled in state courts in the second half of 2013.The first trial in one of these other jurisdictions was completed in July 2012 and resulted in a judgment against the company of approximately $3.6 million. The company has appealed this decision. The company does not believe that this verdict is representative of the potential outcomes of other Womens Health Product Claims. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Womens Health Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February14, 2013, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 55 plaintiffs have been filed or asserted against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of the companys vena cava filter products. In addition, three putative class actions have been filed against the company in various state courts on behalf of plaintiffs who are alleged to have no present injury (all lawsuits, collectively, the Filter Product Claims). The putative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)punitive damages; (iii)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (iv)attorneys fees. A class certification hearing in one of the class actions is scheduled to take place in May 2013. The first Filter Product Claim trial was completed in June 2012 and resulted in a judgment for the company based on the finding that the company was not liable for the plaintiffs damages. The company expects additional trials of Filter Product Claims to take place over the next 12 months. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Filter Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In most product liability litigations of this nature, including the unsettled Hernia Product Claims, the Womens Health Product Claims and the Filter Product Claims, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding the unsettled Hernia Product Claims, the Womens Health Product Claims, the Filter Product Claims and related matters as these cases progress.
The company believes that many settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, relating to product liability matters are or may be covered in whole or in part under its product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance carriers. In certain circumstances, insurance carriers reserve their rights with respect to coverage, or contest or deny coverage, as has occurred with respect to certain claims. When this occurs, the company intends to vigorously contest disputes with respect to its insurance coverage and to enforce its rights under the terms of its insurance policies, and accordingly, will record receivables with respect to amounts due under these policies, when recovery is probable. Amounts recovered under the companys product liability insurance policies may be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs relating to claims. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available.
The companys insurance coverage with respect to the Hernia Product Claims has been depleted. In connection with the Hernia Product Claims, the company is in dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers relating to an aggregate of $25 million of insurance receivables. Binding arbitration of this dispute concluded in February 2013 in Bermuda, and the company is awaiting a decision.
In connection with the Womens Health Product Claims, the company is in dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers relating to an aggregate of $50 million of insurance coverage.
For additional information regarding Hernia Product Claims, Womens Health Product Claims and Filter Product Claims, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
I-14 Table of Contents Other Legal Matters The company has received subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands from a number of State Attorneys General seeking information related to the sales and marketing of certain of the companys products that are the subject of the Hernia Product Claims and the Womens Health Product Claims. The company intends to cooperate with these requests. Since it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, the company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In November2006, the company received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG), under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes, seeking documents related to the companys brachytherapy business (the Brachytherapy Matter). On January27, 2012, the company announced that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the civil and criminal divisions of the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia to resolve claims with respect to the Brachytherapy Matter. In connection with this preliminary agreement, the company previously recorded a charge of approximately $51.0 million ($40.8 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2011. The ultimate settlement of this matter is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. If the definitive agreements are not finalized, the eventual costs related to this matter could be materially different than this charge and the company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore& Associates Inc.s (Gore) ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135 (the 135 patent). The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the District Court ruled that Gore failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. In March 2009, the District Court doubled the jury award to approximately $371 million for damages through June 2007. The District Court also awarded the company attorneys fees of $19 million and prejudgment interest of approximately $20 million. In addition, the District Court denied Gores remaining motions, including its motions for a new trial and to set aside the jurys verdict. In July 2010, the District Court awarded the company approximately $109 million in additional damages for the period from July 2007 through March 2009. Gore has deposited or secured the foregoing amounts with the District Court. The District Court also assessed a royalty rate of between 12.5% and 20%, depending on the product, that will be used to calculate damages for Gores infringing sales from April 2009 through the expiration of the patent. Gore has made additional deposits with the District Court of approximately $471 million, representing Gores calculation of royalties for its infringing sales through December 2012. Gore appealed this matter to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Court of Appeals), which on February10, 2012 affirmed the decision of the District Court. Gore filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for a rehearing of its appeal. On June14, 2012, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its February10, 2012 decision, including the ongoing royalty rates as set by the District Court, with the exception of the issue of willfulness with respect to Gores infringement of the 135 patent, which was remanded to the District Court. On October12, 2012, Gore filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court requesting a review of the portion of the decision that the Court of Appeals reaffirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Gores petition on January14, 2013. The company filed a motion with the District Court to execute on the judgment other than with respect to the amounts related to willfulness. On January28, 2013, Gore filed with the U.S. District Court a Request for Judicial Notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Gores previously filed request for a re-examination of the 135 patent. The timing of final resolution of these matters remains uncertain. Since the company considers these matters a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded. Even if the company is ultimately successful in this lawsuit, it cannot give any assurances that royalties for Gores future infringing sales will remain at or near historic levels.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings I-15 Table of Contents brought under various federal laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state or foreign laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and/or results of operations.
The company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other legal matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement and mediation discussions taking into consideration developments in the matters and the risks and uncertainties surrounding litigation. These discussions could result in settlements of one or more of these claims at any time.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information below.
Overview The company designs, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe and Japan are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are the companys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.
The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2012, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 6.9%. The company expects R&D expense as a percentage of net sales to increase in future years. The company also makes and expects to continue to make selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consider acquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $159.3million in 2012, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.
Acquisitions and Other Initiatives On October19, 2012, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Neomend, Inc. (Neomend), a privately-held company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative surgical sealants. The total purchase consideration of $133.7 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $25 million, which is based on the achievement of sales-based milestones through 2016. Neomends products expand Bards existing surgical specialties product portfolio to include the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of intraoperative air leaks in connection with thoracic surgery. Neomends proprietary technology and pipeline provide the opportunity for future clinical indications across a variety of surgical specialty applications. For more information on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company committed to a plan (the 2012 Restructuring Plan) to improve its overall cost structure and enhance operational effectiveness. The company expects the 2012 Restructuring Plan to result in the elimination of certain positions and other employee terminations worldwide. In connection with this plan, the company recorded employee separation costs under the companys existing severance programs and other costs related to one-time employee termination benefits of $19.2 million ($13.0 million after tax). Substantially all of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures. The company expects these restructuring costs to result in pre-tax cost savings of approximately $15 million on an annual basis. See Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
II-3 Table of Contents On October30, 2012, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% senior unsecured notes due 2018. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. Net proceeds from this offering were $495.4 million, after deducting debt offering costs, consisting of underwriting commissions and offering expenses, and a debt issuance discount. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper and acquisitions. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Healthcare Reform Significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in 2010 in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA). The PPACA requires, among other things, the company to pay a 2.3% excise tax on most U.S. medical device sales beginning in 2013. The company has evaluated the impact of this tax on its overall business. Based on forecasted 2013 annual U.S. sales, the excise tax is expected to be approximately $40 million.
Results of Operations Net Sales Bards 2012 consolidated net sales increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) over 2011 consolidated net sales. Bards 2011 consolidated net sales increased 6% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) over 2010 consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales by approximately 140 basis points and 70 basis points for 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior years. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.
Bards 2012 United States net sales of $1,967.7 million increased 1% compared to $1,956.0 million in 2011. Bards 2012 international net sales of $990.4 million increased 5% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to $940.4 million in 2011. Bards 2011 United States net sales increased 4% compared to $1,889.0 million in 2010. Bards 2011 international net sales increased 13% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to $831.2million in 2010.

Stents and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheters were the primary contributors to the growth in this product line in 2012. Net sales of stents in 2012 benefited from an issue with the availability of a competitors products. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheters, stents and biopsy products were the primary contributors to the growth in this product line in 2011.
Consolidated net sales of electrophysiology products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

Other (income) expense, net, in 2011 included charges related to legal settlements and commitments of $246.5 million, charges for the impairment of Greek bonds of $11.5 million and net restructuring costs of $7.8 million. See Note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Income Tax Provision The companys effective tax rate for 2012 was approximately 28% compared to approximately 36% in 2011 and approximately 29% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 reflected the tax effect of a charge for legal settlements related to the Hernia Product Claims, which were incurred in a low tax jurisdiction, and a charge related to the Brachytherapy Matter, part of which is not expected to be tax deductible. The tax rate in 2011 also reflected a tax benefit of $17.6 million for certain tax positions being settled as a result of the completion of U.S.Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations for the tax years from 2005 through 2007 and certain examinations in other jurisdictions.
Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and Earnings per Share Available to Common Shareholders The company reported 2012 net income attributable to common shareholders of $530.1 million, an increase of 62% from 2011 net income attributable to common shareholders of $328.0 million. The company reported 2012 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $6.16, an increase of 67% from 2011 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.69. Net income attributable to common shareholders in 2012 reflects asset impairments of $13.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, net restructuring costs of $11.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, and acquisition-related items (purchase accounting adjustments, transaction and integration costs and IPR&D) of $8.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Net income for 2012 also reflects an increase to the income tax provision of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, due to the write-down of a tax receivable in a foreign jurisdiction.
The company reported 2011 net income attributable to common shareholders of $328.0 million, a decrease of 36% from 2010 net income attributable to common shareholders of $509.2 million. The company reported 2011 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.69, a decrease of 31% from 2010 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $5.32. Net income attributable to common shareholders in 2011 reflects charges for legal settlements and commitments of $230.3 million, or $2.59 per diluted share, acquisition-related items (primarily integration and transaction costs and IPR&D) of $11.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, and charges for the impairment of Greek bonds of $11.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Net income for 2011 also reflects restructuring costs of $5.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share and a decrease to the income tax provision of $17.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, as a result of the reduction of certain tax positions as discussed above.
II-8 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financial flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December31: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 896.3 $ 596.4 $ 641.4 Working capital 1,399.6 773.5 1,123.3 Current ratio 4.13/1 1.84/1 3.75/1 Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $786.1 million and $586.9million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companys committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.
For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $661.2million, $721.5 million and $637.8 million respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects current year payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims settled in 2011, partially offset by improvements in accounts receivable collections. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 reflects higher net income, excluding non-cash items and the timing of tax payments.
During 2012, the company used $98.2 million in cash for investing activities, $674.1 million less than in 2011. During 2011, the company used $772.3 million in cash for investing activities, $417.2 million more than in 2010. Capital expenditures amounted to $72.6 million, $71.4 million and $51.2million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in 2012 reflects a decrease of $122.1 million related to the release of restricted cash from qualified settlement funds (QSFs) to claimants pursuant to the proposed settlement of certain Hernia Product Claims. Net cash used for investing activities in 2011 reflects an increase of $147.1 million in restricted cash related to payments to QSFs pursuant to the proposed settlement of certain Hernia Product Claims. The company spent $159.3 million in 2012, $557.2million in 2011 and $303.9 million in 2010 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines.
During 2012, the company used $263.2 million in cash for financing activities compared to the $3.9 million provided by financing activities in 2011 and the $310.6 million used for financing activities in 2010.
Total debt was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, respectively. The increase in debt in 2012 reflected the proceeds of $499.4 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, net of debt issuance discount. Total debt to total capitalization was 42.3%, 40.7% and 37.6% at December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The company spent approximately $472.4million to repurchase 4,903,677 shares of common stock in 2012 compared to approximately $221.8 million to repurchase 2,519,410 shares of common stock in 2011 and approximately $1.1billion to repurchase 12,025,000 shares in 2010. Purchases of common stock for 2011 also included a payment of $58.9 million in cash remitted to the bank counterparty upon final II-9 Table of Contents settlement under the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement is included in purchases of common stock in 2011. The repurchases of common stock in 2010 included $750.0 million to repurchase 8,100,000 shares upon initial settlement under the ASR agreement with the bank counterparty. The company paid cash dividends of $66.7 million, $64.6 million and $66.9 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2010, the company purchased the noncontrolling interest in its Malaysian operation for $25.9 million.
The company maintains a $600 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that expires in October 2016. The credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December31, 2012, the company was in compliance with this covenant. The company had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December31, 2012 and $304.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December31, 2011.
Contractual Obligations Payments due under contractual obligations at December31, 2012, are as follows: (dollars in millions) Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5+ Years Forward contracts $ 75.1 $ 75.1 $  $  $  Long-term debt 1,773.0 39.7 83.1 329.6 1,320.6 Operating lease obligations 153.5 23.6 38.6 31.7 59.6 Acquisition and related milestones 108.9 2.4 106.5   Purchase obligations 201.9 162.3 33.4 5.1 1.1 Legal settlements 25.0 25.0    Other long-term liabilities 102.3 11.4 11.2 15.4 64.3 $ 2,439.7 $ 339.5 $ 272.8 $ 381.8 $ 1,445.6 The table above does not include $43.4 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $4.8 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.
Forward contracts - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.
Long-term debt - Long-term debt includes expected principal and interest payments, including the effect of an interest rate swap contract.
Operating lease obligations - The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.
Acquisition and related milestones - The company may make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets under various acquisition and related arrangements. The table above excludes amounts for these milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.
Purchase obligations - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course of business.
II-10 Table of Contents Legal settlements - Payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims, subject to certain settlement conditions, may be made from QSFs.
Other long-term liabilities - The company estimates required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation.
Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of GAAP results.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially different result.
Revenue Recognition - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Share-Based Compensation - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option.
As share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
II-11 Table of Contents Contingencies - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/or costs related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these policies may be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will be otherwise available. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes - The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversed once the statutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material to its income tax provision and results of operations.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns - The company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the average length of time to collect receivables, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.
It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in the period of change.
Acquisitions - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalized and recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For IPR&D, these methodologies II-12 Table of Contents include consideration of the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility. Amounts allocated to IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the asset and amortization will begin. When the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for as a business combination, no goodwill is recognized. The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.
Goodwill - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Pension Plans - The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $0.9million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $0.9million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new statement that requires the company to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. Under this statement, the company will present the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of AOCI based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, the company would cross reference to the related footnote for additional information. This FASB statement will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2013.
Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical II-13 Table of Contents or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above and those under Item1A. Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing processes and supply chain programs or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;  the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products;  the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfully integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions on favorable terms;  the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies;  the ability to implement, and realize the benefits of, our plans to invest in our business, including our plan to increase research and development expenditures with a focus on new market categories, increase growth in emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States and acquire growth platforms designed to change the mix of our portfolio towards faster, sustainable long-term growth;  the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;  the ability to reduce exposure and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;  internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others;  changes in factors and assumptions or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns, which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period; II-14 Table of Contents  changes in factors and assumptions could cause pension cost recorded in future periods to differ from the pension cost recorded in the current period;  the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in the companys pension plans and the possibility that the company may need to make additional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the fair value of such assets;  damage to a facility where our products are manufactured or from which they are distributed, which could render the company unable to manufacture or distribute one or more products and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets;  the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms;  the ability to recover for claims made to our insurance companies; and  the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities, including our 2012 Restructuring Plan, to improve the companys overall cost structure and improve efficiency.
Competitive factors, including:  the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant and complex contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad;  development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development which could negatively impact sales of our products or render one or more of our products obsolete;  technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products;  attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; and  reprocessing by third-party reprocessors of our products designed and labeled for single use.

Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December31, 2012 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $3.0 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $0.1million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.
The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents, for which the market values are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt is affected by a change in the medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt including the effect of the related interest rate swap contract effectively converting the 2.875% fixed-rate notes to floating-rate instruments approximated $1,532.1 million at December31, 2012. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated $1,444.6 million or $1,620.8million, respectively, on December31, 2012. For additional discussion of market risk, see Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.
Based on its assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012.
The companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on pageII-18.

II-26 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations - C. R. Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Bard) are engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities.
Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of C.R.Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of most foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November30. No events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries during the months of December 2012, 2011 or 2010 that materially affected the financial position or results of operations of the company. The company has no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation.
Related Parties - The company and Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. are parties to an equally-owned joint venture, Medicon Inc. (Medicon), which distributes Bards products in Japan. Bard accounts for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. All transactions with Medicon are denominated in U.S. dollars. Bard recorded sales to Medicon of $155.3 million, $139.0 million and $128.7 million for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Bard eliminates the intercompany profits on sales to Medicon until Medicon sells Bards products to a third party. Bard recorded Medicon equity income of $9.6 million, $3.8 million and $3.6million for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Bard received dividends from Medicon of $1.8million, $7.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Bards investment in Medicon was $23.7 million and $15.9 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in accounts receivable are trade receivables due from Medicon for purchases of Bards products of $39.4million and $37.4 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The company evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Foreign Currency - Net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current year-end rates, and revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average monthly rates during each monthly period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and credited or charged directly to a separate component of shareholders investment. Any foreign currency gains or losses related to monetary assets are charged to other (income) expense, net.
Revenue Recognition - The companys net sales represent gross sales invoiced to both end-user customers and independent distributors, less certain related charges, including discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. The company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time II-27 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenue and associated cost are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Charges for discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the revenue is recorded. The accrual for product returns, discounts and other allowances is based on the companys history. The company allows customers to return defective or damaged products. Historically, product returns have not been material. The company grants sales rebates to independent distributors based upon the distributors reporting of end-user sales and pricing. Sales rebates are accrued by the company in the period in which the sale is recorded. The companys rebate accrual is based on its history of actual rebates paid. In estimating rebate accruals, the company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including stated rebate rates. The companys reserves for rebates are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. The company adjusts reserves to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts. Such adjustments impact the amount of net product sales revenue recognized by the company in the period of adjustment.
Shipping and Handling Costs - Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.
Advertising Costs - Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $2.1million, $3.0million and $3.3 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in marketing, selling and administrative expense.
Research and Development - Research and development expense is comprised of costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities, and acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) arising from acquisitions not accounted for as a business combination. IPR&D arising from a business combination are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the asset and amortization will begin.
Share-Based Compensation - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and amounted to $773.1 million and $526.6 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Accounts Receivable - In addition to trade receivables, accounts receivable included $47.6million and $39.3million of non-trade receivables at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company changed its method of accounting for certain domestic inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. This change is considered preferable because it will improve financial reporting by providing a more meaningful presentation, as it better reflects the impact of recent costs in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the change from the LIFO method to the FIFO method will enhance the comparability of financial results with all of the companys other operations where cost is determined using the FIFO method. The change to the FIFO method was retrospectively applied by restating prior periods II-28 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) presented. There was no material impact on the consolidated statements of income for all prior periods presented. The consolidated financial statements reflect reductions in deferred tax assets of $2.7 million, other assets of $9.1 million, income taxes payable of $0.8 million, and retained earnings of $11.0 million for all periods presented.
Depreciation - Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives primarily range from three to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 20 years for machinery and equipment. Depreciation expense was $47.0million, $43.2 million and $41.1 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively.
Software Capitalization and Amortization - Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five to seven years. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment. The company capitalizes certain costs associated with internal-use software such as the payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with internal-use software are expensed during the design phase until the point at which the project has reached the application development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The company capitalized $8.6million, $6.4million and $4.7 million of internal-use software for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense for capitalized software was $6.6million, $8.6million and $10.7million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Goodwill - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.
Other Intangible Assets - Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 22 years with a weighted average of 13 years. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. To the extent carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. The company regularly assesses its tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. Any reserves are adjusted once the statutes of limitation have expired or the tax position is remeasured or effectively settled. The companys policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions as income tax expense.
II-29 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Income Statement Presentation of Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Government Authorities - The company follows a net basis policy with regard to sales, use, value added or any other tax collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, which excludes them from both net sales and expenses.
Treasury Stock - The company accounts for treasury stock purchases as retirements by reducing retained earnings for the cost of the repurchase. Reissuances of previously repurchased shares are accounted for as new issuances. There were 34.5million and 31.4million of previously repurchased shares at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Derivative Instruments - The company recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive loss depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedged transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with future intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. These risks are managed using derivative instruments, mainly through forward currency and option contracts. The company does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. None of these derivative instruments extend beyond December 2013. All of these derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings on the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. At December31, 2012, all of these derivative instruments were highly effective hedging instruments because they were denominated in the same currency as the hedged item and because the maturities of the derivative instruments matched the timing of the hedged items.
When applicable, foreign currency exposures that arise from remeasuring intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are mitigated through the use of forward contracts. Hedges of these foreign exchange exposures are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The gains or losses on these instruments are recognized in earnings and are effectively offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged items.
The company may use interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure on its long-term debt. The company maintains an interest rate swap contract with respect to its $250 million of 2.875% notes due 2016. Under this interest rate swap contract, the company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional principal amount of these notes. The companys swap contract is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge. Changes in the fair value of the swap contract offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates.
Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
2. Acquisitions The company acquires businesses, products and technologies to augment its existing product lines and from time-to-time may divest product lines for strategic reasons. Unaudited pro forma financial information has not been presented because the effects of acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis.
On October19, 2012, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Neomend, Inc. (Neomend), a privately-held company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative surgical sealants. The II-30 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) total purchase consideration of $133.7 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $25 million, which is based on the achievement of sales-based milestones through 2016. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined by utilizing a probability weighted estimated cash flow stream adjusted for the expected timing of the payment and was not material as of the acquisition date. Neomends products expand Bards existing surgical specialties product portfolio to include the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of intraoperative air leaks in connection with thoracic surgery. Neomends proprietary technology and pipeline provides the opportunity for future clinical indications across a variety of surgical specialty applications. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of: core technologies of $62.8 million; deferred tax assets of $27.0 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; deferred tax liabilities of $36.0 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; and other net liabilities of $1.9 million. An IPR&D asset of $29.4 million was also recorded for the development of cardiovascular indications using Neomends proprietary technology. The fair value of the IPR&D asset was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk, utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate of 24%. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $52.4 million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of future applications for projects and products that did not meet the criteria for separate recognition of IPR&D. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 15 years. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.3 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expenses. The company has not yet finalized the purchase accounting, which may be adjusted as further information about conditions existing at the acquisition date become available.
On December16, 2011, the company acquired Lutonix, Inc. (Lutonix), a development stage company specializing in drug coated balloon technology for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease. The total purchase consideration of $298.0 million included an upfront cash payment of $228.0 million and the fair value of contingent consideration of $70.0 million. The contingent consideration, which could total $100 million, consists of a milestone payment related to Pre-Market Approval (PMA) of Lutonixs drug-coated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon. Lutonix is conducting an investigational device exemption (IDE) trial approved by the FDA using drug-coated balloons for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease. The Lutonix LEVANT 2 study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center pivotal IDE trial comparing the Lutonix drug-coated balloon to standard balloon angioplasty. Lutonix received the European Conformity regulatory approval (CE mark) in 2011, and Bard started selling the device in Europe in 2012. The company plans to begin a larger registry study in Europe and additional IDE studies in 2013 to support broader marketing claims and obtain additional clinical data. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date.
The purchase price allocation at fair value resulted in the recognition of: IPR&D of $131.5 million; core technologies of $33.4 million; deferred tax assets of $24.7 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; deferred tax liabilities of $59.5 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; and other net assets of $1.6 million. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $166.3 million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of a large potential market for drug-coated PTA balloons in alternate and expanded indications, and other cost synergies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 12 years. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.4 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expense.
The IPR&D assets, which are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, represent the development of drug-coated balloons and the LEVANT 2 clinical trial for use of these balloons in the superficial femoral and II-31 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) proximal popliteal arteries. The launch of this device in the United States is currently expected to occur in 2015, subject to regulatory approvals. The fair value of this intangible asset was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk, utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate of 20%. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined by utilizing a probability weighted estimated cash flow stream adjusted for the expected timing of the payment. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the contingent consideration liability will be remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings. At December31, 2012, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was approximately $72 million. The underlying probability of payment of the contingent consideration was 75% at both December31, 2012 and 2011.
On November10, 2011, the company acquired Medivance, Inc. (Medivance) for total cash consideration of $255.5 million.

The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $112.2 million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of expanding the market for Medivances products. Synergies are expected to result from the alignment of critical care sales call points and other manufacturing efficiencies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Customer relationships and core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 13 and 14 years, respectively. Customer relationships are recorded as a component of other intangible assets. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.7 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expense. In connection with this acquisition, the company recorded a charge of $1.8 million ($1.1 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, associated with integration costs.

3. Restructuring and Asset Impairments Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company committed to a plan (the 2012 Restructuring Plan) to improve its overall cost structure and enhance operational effectiveness. The company expects the 2012 II-33 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Restructuring Plan to result in the elimination of certain positions and other terminations worldwide. In connection with this plan, the company recorded employee separation costs under the companys existing severance programs and other costs related to one-time termination benefits of $19.2 million ($13.0 million after tax). Substantially all of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures. At December31, 2012, the remaining liability related to the 2012 Restructuring Plan was $17.8 million, which reflects cash payments of $1.4 million. The company expects activities under this plan to be substantially complete by the end of 2013.
During the second half of 2011, the company initiated certain restructuring actions, which included the realignment of certain sales functions in the United States. In connection with these actions, the company recorded employee separation costs under the companys existing severance programs of $12.0 million ($8.1 million after tax). Substantially all of these costs were cash expenditures paid by the end of 2012. In addition, $1.8 million and $1.6 million of these restructuring costs were reversed in the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
In December 2010, the company committed to a restructuring plan (the 2010 Restructuring Plan), which included the realignment of certain manufacturing, sales and marketing, and administrative functions. In connection with this plan, the company recorded employee separation costs under the companys existing severance programs and other costs related to one-time employee termination benefits of $16.7 million ($11.4 million after tax). Substantially all of these costs were cash expenditures paid during 2011. In addition, $2.6 million of these restructuring costs were reversed in 2011.
Asset Impairments During 2012, the company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $22.2 million ($13.8 million after tax). These charges consisted of a write-down of $13.2 million ($8.0 million after tax) related to certain core technologies associated with a non-strategic product in the companys vascular product group, and impairments of $9.0 million ($5.8 million after tax) of assets not related to operations. These asset impairment charges were measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs that are categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy, which is described further in Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The charges were recorded to other (income) expense, net.
4. Income Taxes The components of income from operations before income taxes for the following years ended December31 consisted of: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) United States $ 435.1 $ 425.1 $ 455.8 Foreign 297.3 85.7 261.9 $ 732.4 $ 510.8 $ 717.7 II-34 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The income tax provision for the following years ended December31 consisted of: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Current provision Federal $ 115.0 $ 170.0 $ 168.3 Foreign 40.0 23.3 31.8 State 15.6 7.8 10.3 170.6 201.1 210.4 Deferred provision (benefit) Federal 34.2 (18.9 ) 3.7 Foreign (4.2 ) (2.7 ) (7.2 ) State 1.7 3.3 1.2 31.7 (18.3 ) (2.3 ) $ 202.3 $ 182.8 $ 208.1 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December31 consisted of: 2012 2011 (dollarsinmillions) Deferred tax assets Employee benefits $ 169.9 $ 168.8 Inventory  16.6 Receivables and rebates 24.1 25.8 Accrued expenses 34.7 30.5 Loss carryforwards and credits 112.5 112.4 Gross deferred tax assets 341.2 354.1 Valuation allowance (32.5 ) (32.2 ) 308.7 321.9 Deferred tax liabilities Intangibles 252.4 234.2 Accelerated depreciation 25.8 22.8 Other 3.9 3.2 282.1 260.2 $ 26.6 $ 61.7 At December31, 2012, the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $163.9million, which expire between 2014 and 2032, state net operating loss carryforwards of $363.7 million, which expire between 2013 and 2033, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $30.6 million, which generally expire between 2014 and 2021. The company also had various tax credits of $10.8 million with an indefinite life and $15.6 million, which expire between 2014 and 2033.
The company records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. The company considers future taxable income and the periods over which it must be earned in assessing the need for valuation allowances. In the event the company determines it would not II-35 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made. At December31, 2012, the valuation allowance primarily related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforward and credits, and to certain other state deferred tax assets.
A reconciliation between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate for the following years ended December31 is: 2012 2011 2010 Federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 2 % 2 % 2 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (9 )% (2 )% (9 )% Legal settlement, non-deductible portion  2 %  Other, net  (1 )% 1 % 28 % 36 % 29 % The companys foreign tax incentives consist of incentive tax grants in Malaysia and Puerto Rico. The companys grant in Malaysia was entered into on March1, 2010 and will expire in 2015. The incentive tax grant in Puerto Rico will expire in 2016. The approximate dollar and per share effects of the Malaysian and Puerto Rican tax grants are as follows: 2012 2011 (A) 2010 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Tax benefit $ 53.3 $ 3.7 $ 44.6 Per share benefit $ 0.62 $ 0.04 $ 0.47 (A) No tax benefit was recognized from the incentive tax grant in Puerto Rico due to the charge for Hernia Product Claims.
A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows: 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Balance, January1 $ 45.0 $ 53.6 Additions related to prior year tax positions 1.7 4.5 Reductions related to prior year tax positions (5.3 ) (9.0 ) Additions for tax positions of the current year 7.2 8.1 Settlements (2.8 ) (11.3 ) Lapse of statutes of limitation (2.4 ) (0.9 ) Balance, December31 $ 43.4 $ 45.0 The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions and faces audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. As of December31, 2012, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes was $43.4 million (of which $36.6 million would impact the effective tax rate if recognized), plus $4.8 million of II-36 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) accrued interest. As of December31, 2011, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $45.0 million plus $5.0 million of accrued interest. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions amounted to a $0.2 million credit in 2012, a $1.6 million credit in 2011, and $0.7 million of expense in 2010.
The company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statutes of limitation expire. Within specific countries, the company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities, and subsidiaries operating within the country may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates. As of December31, 2012, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination in the companys major tax jurisdictions are: United States  federal 2008andforward United States  states 2003 and forward Germany 2010 and forward Malaysia 2007 and forward Puerto Rico 2008 and forward United Kingdom 2010 and forward In 2011, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $17.6million as a result of the completion of the U.S Internal Revenue Service examinations for the tax years from 2005 through 2007 and certain examinations in other jurisdictions. Depending upon open tax examinations and/or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $17.2million within the next 12months.
At December31, 2012, the company did not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations of approximately $1.6billion as it is the companys intention to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings outside of the United States. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these permanently reinvested earnings is not practicable.
5. Earnings per Common Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed under the two-class method, which requires nonvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents to be treated as a separate class of securities in calculating EPS. Participating securities include nonvested restricted stock and units, nonvested shares or units under the management stock purchase program, and certain other nonvested stock-based awards. EPS is computed using the following common share information for the following years ended December31: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars and shares in millions) EPS Numerator: Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 530.1 $ 328.0 $ 509.2 Less: Income allocated to participating securities 10.0 6.1 5.5 Net income available to common shareholders $ 520.1 $ 321.9 $ 503.7 EPS Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding 83.3 85.8 93.4 Dilutive common share equivalents from share-based compensation plans 1.1 1.5 1.2 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding, assuming dilution 84.4 87.3 94.6 II-37 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 6. Financial Instruments Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments The company enters into readily marketable forward and option contracts with financial institutions to help reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These contracts limit volatility because gains and losses associated with foreign exchange rate movements are generally offset by movements in the underlying hedged item. The notional value of the companys forward currency and option contracts was $128.1 million and $205.2 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Interest Rate Derivative Instruments On December20, 2010, the company entered into an interest rate swap contract in connection with a debt offering. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The swap contract effectively converts the 2.875% fixed-rate notes to a floating-rate instrument. The notional value of the companys interest rate swap contract is $250.0 million.
The location and fair values of derivative instruments segregated between those derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and those that are not designated as hedging instruments at December31, are as follows: Balance Sheet Location Fair Value ofDerivatives Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Forward currency contracts Othercurrentassets $ 1.4 $ 1.5 Option currency contracts Other current assets 0.6 4.3 Interest rate swap contract Otherassets 13.3 12.1 $ 15.3 $ 17.9 Forward currency contracts Accruedexpenses $ 0.4 $ 6.4 $ 0.4 $ 6.4 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments (dollars in millions) Forward currency contracts Other current assets $  $ 3.8 $  $ 3.8 The location and amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the impact on shareholders investment for the years ended December31, are as follows: Gain/(Loss) RecognizedinOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) Location of Gain/(Loss)Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comp.

II-38 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) At December31, 2012, the company had losses of approximately $0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet that are expected to be reclassified into earnings in 2013.

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Fair value is defined as the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy range from Level 1 having observable inputs to Level 3 having unobservable inputs.
The following table summarizes certain financial instrument assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December31: 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Foreign government bonds and notes $  $ 3.6 Forward currency contracts 1.0 (1.1 ) Option currency contracts 0.6 4.3 Interest rate swap contract 13.3 12.1 The fair values were measured using significant other observable inputs and valued by reference to similar financial instruments, adjusted for restrictions and other terms specific to each instrument. These financial instruments are categorized as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the liability for contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions was $77.1 million at each of the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. The fair value was measured using significant unobservable inputs and is categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.
II-39 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December31, 2012. The fair value of commercial paper borrowings of $304.5 million at December31, 2011 approximated the carrying value.
The estimated fair value of long-term debt including the effect of the related swap contract was $1,532.2 million and $1,038.7 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The fair value was estimated using dealer quotes for similarly-rated debt instruments over the remaining contractual term of the companys obligation. Long-term debt is categorized as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
Concentration Risks The company is potentially subject to concentration of credit risk through its cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Concentrations of risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers dispersed across many geographic areas. However, accounts receivable balances include sales to government-supported healthcare systems outside the United States. The company continues to monitor sovereign debt issues and economic conditions in Europe and evaluates accounts receivable in certain countries for potential collection risks. Deteriorating economic conditions and other factors in certain countries in Europe have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these accounts receivable and may require the company to re-evaluate the collectability of these receivables in future periods. The company has experienced significant delays in the collection of accounts receivable associated with the national healthcare systems in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. At December31, 2012, the companys accounts receivable, net of allowances, from the national healthcare systems in these countries and amounts past due greater than 365 days were as follows: Accounts receivable, net Greaterthan 365 days past due (dollars in millions) Spain $ 18.5 $ 0.4 Italy 27.5 4.5 Greece 13.0 4.0 Portugal 3.7 0.8 $ 62.7 $ 9.7 During 2010, the company recorded to other (income) expense, net, a write-down of Greece receivables of $3.8 million based on a proposal that the Greek government announced to settle its outstanding debts from 2007 through 2009, primarily by issuing non-interest bearing bonds. During 2011, the company received $16.8 million of bonds, net of discount, in settlement of 2007 through 2009 accounts receivable. During 2011, the company recorded to other (income) expense, net, charges totaling $11.5 million related to other-than-temporary impairments of these bonds. In March 2012, the Greek government approved a private sector bond exchange program for holders of Greek public debt, including those bonds held by the company. As a result, the companys bonds were exchanged for a combination of new Greek government bonds and certain other notes. In July 2012, the company sold these bonds and notes.
Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end-users, accounted for approximately 36% of the companys net sales in 2012, and the five largest distributors combined, including the companys Medicon joint venture, accounted for approximately 65% of distributors sales. One large distributor accounted II-40 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) for approximately 9% of the companys net sales in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010. This distributor represented gross receivables of approximately $40.9 million and $41.6 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
7. Inventories Inventories at December31 consisted of: 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Finished goods $ 194.6 $ 189.9 Work in process 19.1 21.3 Raw materials 114.8 108.0 $ 328.5 $ 319.2 Consigned inventory was $47.0 million and $41.3 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
8. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets at December31 consisted of: 2012 2011 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization (dollars in millions) Core technologies $ 717.7 $ (211.2 ) $ 660.2 $ (161.5 ) Customer relationships 144.2 (38.8 ) 144.6 (25.7 ) In-process research and development (A) 167.8  136.2  Other intangibles 216.1 (121.2 ) 202.6 (105.1 ) $ 1,245.8 $ (371.2 ) $ 1,143.6 $ (292.3 ) (A) Amounts capitalized as in-process research and development are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Amortization expense was $82.7 million, $63.3 million and $53.1 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the years 2013 through 2017 based on the companys amortizable intangible assets as of December31, 2012 is as follows: 2013 - $84.7 million; 2014 - $83.7 million; 2015 - $81.1 million; 2016 - $77.6 million; and 2017 - $76.3 million.
9. Debt Long-term debt at December31 consisted of: 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) 1.375% notes due 2018 $ 499.4 $  4.40% notes due 2021 497.1 496.8 2.875% notes due 2016 263.3 262.1 6.70% notes due 2026 149.8 149.8 $ 1,409.6 $ 908.7 II-41 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) On October30, 2012, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% senior unsecured notes due 2018. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. Net proceeds from this offering were $495.4 million, after deducting debt offering costs, consisting of underwriting commissions and offering expenses of $4.0 million, which were capitalized and recorded to other assets, and a debt issuance discount of $0.6 million, which was recorded to long-term debt. The debt offering costs and debt issuance discount will be amortized over the term of the notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper and acquisitions.
On December20, 2010, the company issued $750 million senior unsecured notes consisting of $250million aggregate principal amount of 2.875%notes due 2016 and $500million aggregate principal amount of 4.40%notes due 2021. In connection with the offering of these notes, on December15, 2010, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with a bank counterparty to repurchase $750 million of the companys outstanding common stock. The company received 8.1million shares upon initial settlement under the ASR transaction. The initial settlement was subject to an adjustment related to a forward purchase contract based on the volume-weighted average share price of the companys common stock during a predetermined period less a discount. The initial payment to the bank counterparty was recorded as a decrease to shareholders investment, consisting of decreases of $2.0 million in common stock, $10.2 million in capital in excess of par value, and $737.8 million in retained earnings. On September9, 2011, the company remitted a cash payment of $58.9 million to the bank counterparty upon final settlement under the ASR transaction. The payment to the bank counterparty was recorded as a decrease to shareholders investment, consisting of a decrease of $69.1 million in retained earnings and an increase of $10.2 million in capital in excess of par value.
With the exception of the 6.70% notes due 2026, the notes included in the above table are redeemable in whole or in part at any time, at the companys option at specified redemption prices or, at the holders option, upon change of control triggering event, as defined in the applicable indenture.
The company maintains a $600 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that expires in October 2016. The credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December31, 2012, the company was in compliance with this covenant. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December31, 2012 and $304.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December31, 2011. The weighted-average effective interest rate on commercial paper borrowings outstanding was 0.3% as of December31, 2011.
10. Commitments and Contingencies General In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings, investigations and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. The company accounts for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings and claims when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. At any given time, in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of certain intangible assets on the companys balance sheet II-42 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount. The company believes that any of these proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
The company requires limited product warranty accruals as the majority of the companys products are intended for single use. Certain of the companys products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from sale. The company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale.
Product Liability Matters As of February14, 2013, approximately 890 federal and 730 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 1,750 plaintiffs, as well as two putative class actions in the United States and four putative class actions in various Canadian provinces, are currently pending against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  and certain other hernia repair implant products (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims). One of the U.S. class action lawsuits consolidated ten previously-filed U.S. class action lawsuits. Theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek (i)medical monitoring, (ii)compensatory damages, (iii)punitive damages, (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v)attorneys fees. A class certification hearing in one of the Canadian class actions is scheduled to take place in May 2013. Approximately 705 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 800 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions. The Hernia Product Claims also generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix  Kugel  products beginning in December 2005.
In June2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) transferred Composix  Kugel  lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The MDL court subsequently determined to include other hernia repair products of the company in the MDL proceeding. On June30, 2011, the company announced that it had reached agreements in principle with various plaintiffs law firms to settle the majority of its existing Hernia Product Claims. Each agreement is subject to certain conditions, including requirements for participation in the proposed settlements by a certain minimum number of plaintiffs. In addition, the company continues to engage in discussions with other plaintiffs law firms regarding potential resolution of unsettled Hernia Product Claims, and intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation. Additional trials are scheduled in the second quarter of 2013 and throughout the remainder of 2013. Based on these events, the company recorded to other (income) expense, net, a charge of $184.3 million ($180.6 million after tax) in the second quarter of 2011, which recognized the estimated costs of settling all Hernia Product Claims, including asserted and unasserted claims, and costs to administer the settlements. The charge excludes any costs associated with pending putative class action lawsuits. The company cannot give any assurances that the actual costs incurred with respect to the Hernia Product Claims will not exceed the amount of the charge together with amounts previously accrued. The company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of the Hernia Product Claims that have not settled, including asserted and unasserted claims and the putative class action lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February14, 2013, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,320 plaintiffs have been filed or asserted against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of certain of the companys surgical continence products for women, including its Avaulta  line of products. In addition, five putative class actions in the United States and one putative class action in Canada have been filed against the company (all lawsuits, collectively, the Womens II-43 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Health Product Claims). The Womens Health Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The putative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)compensatory damages; (iii)punitive damages; (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (v)attorneys fees. With respect to certain of these claims, the company believes that one of its suppliers has an obligation to defend and indemnify the company. In October 2010, the JPML transferred the Womens Health Product Claims involving solely Avaulta  products pending in federal courts nationwide into an MDL for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In February 2012, the JPML expanded the scope of and renamed the MDL pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to include lawsuits involving all womens surgical continence products that are manufactured or distributed by the company. In total, approximately 1,835 of the Womens Health Product Claims are pending in federal courts and have been or will be transferred to the MDL in West Virginia, with the remainder of the Womens Health Product Claims in other jurisdictions. Trial dates have been scheduled in the MDL beginning in June 2013 and are scheduled to continue throughout 2013. Additional trials are also scheduled in state courts in the second half of 2013. The first trial in one of these other jurisdictions was completed in July 2012 and resulted in a judgment against the company of approximately $3.6 million. The company has appealed this decision. The company does not believe that this verdict is representative of the potential outcomes of other Womens Health Product Claims. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Womens Health Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February14, 2013, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 55 plaintiffs have been filed or asserted against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of the companys vena cava filter products. In addition, three putative class actions have been filed against the company in various state courts on behalf of plaintiffs who are alleged to have no present injury (all lawsuits, collectively, the Filter Product Claims). The putative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)punitive damages; (iii)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (iv)attorneys fees. A class certification hearing in one of the class actions is scheduled to take place in May 2013. The first Filter Product Claim trial was completed in June 2012 and resulted in a judgment for the company based on the finding that the company was not liable for the plaintiffs damages. The company expects additional trials of Filter Product Claims to take place over the next 12 months. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Filter Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In most product liability litigations of this nature, including the unsettled Hernia Product Claims, the Womens Health Product Claims and the Filter Product Claims, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding the unsettled Hernia Product Claims, the Womens Health Product Claims, the Filter Product Claims and related matters as these cases progress.
The company believes that many settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, relating to product liability matters are or may be covered in whole or in part under its product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance carriers. In certain circumstances, insurance carriers reserve their rights with respect to coverage, or contest or deny coverage, as has occurred with respect to certain claims. When this II-44 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) occurs, the company intends to vigorously contest disputes with respect to its insurance coverage and to enforce its rights under the terms of its insurance policies, and accordingly, will record receivables with respect to amounts due under these policies, when recovery is probable. Amounts recovered under the companys product liability insurance policies may be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs relating to claims. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available.
The companys insurance coverage with respect to the Hernia Product Claims has been depleted. In connection with the Hernia Product Claims, the company is in dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers relating to an aggregate of $25 million of insurance receivables. Binding arbitration of this dispute concluded in February 2013 in Bermuda, and the company is awaiting a decision.
In connection with the Womens Health Product Claims, the company is in dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers relating to an aggregate of $50 million of insurance coverage.
Other Legal Matters The company has received subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands from a number of State Attorneys General seeking information related to the sales and marketing of certain of the companys products that are the subject of the Hernia Product Claims and the Womens Health Product Claims. The company intends to cooperate with these requests. Since it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, the company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In November2006, the company received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG), under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes, seeking documents related to the companys brachytherapy business (the Brachytherapy Matter). On January27, 2012, the company announced that it had reached a preliminary agreement with the civil and criminal divisions of the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia to resolve claims with respect to the Brachytherapy Matter. In connection with this preliminary agreement, the company previously recorded to other (income) expense, net, a charge of approximately $51.0 million ($40.8 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2011. The ultimate settlement of this matter is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. If the definitive agreements are not finalized, the eventual costs related to this matter could be materially different than the previously recorded charge, and the company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore& Associates Inc.s (Gore) ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135 (the 135 patent). The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the District Court ruled that Gore failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. In March 2009, the District Court doubled the jury award to approximately $371 million for damages through June 2007. The District Court also awarded the company attorneys fees of $19 million and prejudgment interest of approximately $20 million. In addition, the District Court denied Gores remaining motions, including its motions for a new trial and to set aside the jurys verdict. In July 2010, the District Court awarded the company approximately $109 million in additional damages for the period from July 2007 through March 2009. Gore has deposited or secured the foregoing amounts with the District Court. The District Court also assessed a royalty rate of between 12.5% and II-45 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 20%, depending on the product, that will be used to calculate damages for Gores infringing sales from April 2009 through the expiration of the patent. Gore has made additional deposits with the District Court of approximately $471 million, representing Gores calculation of royalties for its infringing sales through December 2012. Gore appealed this matter to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Court of Appeals), which on February10, 2012 affirmed the decision of the District Court. Gore filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for a rehearing of its appeal. On June14, 2012, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its February10, 2012 decision, including the ongoing royalty rates as set by the District Court, with the exception of the issue of willfulness with respect to Gores infringement of the 135 patent, which was remanded to the District Court. On October12, 2012, Gore filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court requesting a review of the portion of the decision that the Court of Appeals reaffirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Gores petition on January14, 2013. The company filed a motion with the District Court to execute on the judgment other than with respect to the amounts related to willfulness. On January28, 2013, Gore filed with the U.S. District Court a Request for Judicial Notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Gores previously filed request for a re-examination of the 135 patent. The timing of final resolution of these matters remains uncertain. Since the company considers these matters a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded. Even if the company is ultimately successful in this lawsuit, it cannot give any assurances that royalties for Gores future infringing sales will remain at or near historic levels.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under various federal laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state or foreign laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and/or results of operations.
The company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other legal matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement and mediation discussions taking into consideration developments in the matters and the risks and uncertainties surrounding litigation. These discussions could result in settlements of one or more of these claims at any time.
Accruals for product liability and other legal matters amounted to $158.1 million and $287.3 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The company made total payments of $157.6million to qualified II-46 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) settlement funds (QSFs), of which $8.4 million were made during 2012, subject to certain settlement conditions, for certain Hernia Product Claims. Payments to QSFs were recorded as a component of restricted cash. Total payments of $132.6 million from these QSFs have been made to qualified claimants, of which $130.5million were made during 2012. In addition, other payments of $10.6 million have been made to qualified claimants, of which $8.0 million were made during 2012.
The company recorded receivables from insurance companies for product liability matters amounting to $45.6 million and $51.0 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of which $33.1 million, at December31, 2012, is the subject of the disputes with certain excess insurance carrier, as noted above. After considering the nature of the claims, coverage provisions under the policies, relevant legal issues, the advice and judgment of outside legal counsel, and other pertinent factors, the company believes its claims are meritorious and that it will collect these receivables.
The company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible losses or range of losses, if any, arising from existing product liability matters and other legal matters. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely, and an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight. With respect to the Womens Health Product Claims, the Filter Product Claims and the putative class action lawsuits that are part of the Hernia Product Claims, the company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the following reasons: (i)the proceedings are in early stages; (ii)the company has not received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions; and/or (iii)there are significant factual issues to be resolved. In addition, with respect to the putative class action lawsuits that are part of the Hernia Product Claims and the Filter Product Claims, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class.

Stock Options The company grants stock options to certain employees and may grant stock options to directors with exercise prices equal to the average of the high and low prices of the companys common stock on the date of grant. These stock option awards generally have requisite service periods of up to four years, and ten-year contractual terms. Certain stock option awards granted in prior years provided for accelerated vesting after a minimum of two years if certain performance conditions are met. Summarized information regarding total stock option activity and amounts for the year ended December31, 2012 is as follows: Options Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term(years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (millions) Outstanding - January1 6,890,866 $ 77.75 Granted 945,711 97.41 Exercised (1,343,074 ) 66.73 Canceled/forfeited (208,765 ) 84.91 Outstanding - December31 6,284,738 $ 82.83 6.5 $ 93.8 Exercisable 4,129,293 $ 78.78 5.1 $ 78.3 The company uses a binomial-lattice option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options.

At December31, 2012, there were $27.9 million II-48 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, 1,152,890, 489,648 and 1,105,398 options, respectively, vested with a weighted-average fair value of $21.49, $22.80 and $29.40, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $42.1 million, $88.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively.
Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $89.6million, $106.5 million and $34.3 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises was $14.5million, $31.6 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Restricted Stock and Units Restricted stock awards entitle employees to voting and dividend rights. Restricted stock units entitle employees to dividend rights. Certain restricted stock awards have performance features. Restricted stock and unit grants have requisite service periods of between four to seven years. Compensation expense related to restricted stock and units was $18.7 million, $22.1 million and $21.5 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2012, there were $39.9million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock and unit awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The activity in the nonvested restricted stock and unit awards for the year ended December31, 2012 is as follows: Numberof Shares Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue Outstanding - January 1 1,121,765 $ 84.97 Granted 260,775 96.52 Vested (239,819 ) 85.24 Forfeited (87,096 ) 84.88 Outstanding - December 31 1,055,625 $ 87.76 Other Restricted Stock Units Certain other restricted stock units have requisite service periods of between four and seven years. No voting or dividend rights are associated with these grants until the underlying shares are issued upon vesting. Compensation expense related to these awards was $5.1 million, $4.6 million and $4.8million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2012, there were $22.5 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to these nonvested restricted stock unit awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The activity in the nonvested restricted stock unit awards for the year ended December31, 2012 is as follows: Numberof Shares Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue Outstanding - January 1 547,272 $ 82.36 Granted 152,128 90.38 Vested (71,230 ) 76.30 Forfeited (94,013 ) 83.87 Outstanding - December 31 534,157 $ 85.17 Performance Restricted Stock Units In the first quarter of 2012, the company granted performance restricted stock units to certain officers. Performance restricted stock units have requisite service periods of three II-49 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) years and have no dividend rights. Compensation expense related to performance restricted stock units was $2.6million for the year ended December31, 2012. At December31, 2012, there were $6.3 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance restricted stock units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The actual payout of these units varies based on the companys performance over a three-year period against pre-established targets, including a performance condition based on average earnings per share growth over the period and a market condition modifier based on total shareholder return (TSR) compared to an industry peer group. The actual payout may vary from zero to 200% of an officers target payout. Compensation cost initially recognized assumes that the target payout level will be achieved and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance-related condition. The fair value of these units is based on the market price of the companys stock on the date of grant and uses a Monte Carlo simulation model for the TSR component. The fair value of the TSR component was estimated based on the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 0.41%; dividend yield of 0.85%; and expected life of 2.83 years.
Other Stock-Based Awards The company grants stock awards to directors. Shares have been generally distributed to a director in his or her year of election and vest on a pro rata basis in each year of his or her term, although additional awards may be granted with other terms. The fair value of these awards is charged to compensation expense over the directors terms. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these awards until the awarded stock vests and for certain awards until an additional two-year period lapses. There are voting and dividend rights associated with these awards. Compensation expense related to these stock awards was $0.9million, $1.0 million and $1.2million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2012, there were $0.5million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested other stock-based awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. At December31, 2012 and 2011, nonvested other stock-based awards of 23,107 and 20,867 shares, respectively, were outstanding.
Management Stock Purchase Program The company maintains a management stock purchase program under the Plan (together with a predecessor stock purchase plan, the MSPP). Under the MSPP, employees at a specified level may purchase, with their eligible annual bonus, common stock units at a 30% discount from the lower of the price of the common stock on July1 of the previous year or on the date of purchase, which occurs on the date bonuses are approved by the Board of Directors. Employees make an election on or before June30 of the previous year as to the percentage of their eligible annual bonus that will be used to purchase common stock units under the MSPP. The companys predecessor plan provided for the purchase of shares of the companys common stock. Employees are required to allocate at least 25% of their eligible annual bonuses to purchase common stock units under the MSPP to the extent they have not satisfied certain stock ownership guidelines. MSPP shares or units are restricted from sale or transfer for four years from the purchase date. Only shares or units corresponding to the 30% discount are forfeited if the employees employment terminates prior to the end of the four-year vesting period. Dividends or dividend-equivalents are paid on MSPP shares or units, and the participant has the right to vote all MSPP shares. The activity in the MSPP for the year ended December31, 2012 is as follows: Numberof Shares Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue Outstanding - January 1 217,952 $ 30.38 Purchased 59,471 32.20 Vested (49,523 ) 31.15 Forfeited (15,733 ) 29.80 Outstanding - December 31 212,167 $ 30.76 II-50 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The company uses the Black-Scholes model, as a result of the option-like features of the MSPP, to estimate the expense associated with anticipated MSPP purchases. Compensation expense is recognized over a period that will end four years after purchase. The assumptions used for the following years ended December31 are: 2012 2011 2010 Dividend yield 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.9 % Risk-free interest rate 0.16 % 0.12 % 0.22 % Expected life in years 0.6 0.6 0.6 Expected volatility 20 % 16 % 20 % Fair value $ 38.33 $ 38.25 $ 27.42 Compensation expense related to this program was $6.2 million, $5.6 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2012, there were $4.8million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested MSPP shares and units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of C.R. Bard, Inc. (ESPP), domestic employees and certain foreign employees can purchase Bard stock at a 15% discount to the lesser of the market price on the beginning or ending date of the six-month periods ending June30 and December31 of each year. Participants may elect to make after tax payroll deductions of 1% to 10% of compensation as defined by the plan up to a maximum of $25,000 per year. The ESPP is intended to meet the requirements of Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. At December31, 2012, 644,416shares were available for purchase under the ESPP. Employee payroll deductions are for six-month periods beginning each January1 and July1. Shares of the companys common stock are purchased on June30 or December31 or the following business day, unless either the purchase of such shares was delayed at the election of the participant or the participants employment was terminated. Purchased shares are restricted for sale or transfer for a six-month period. All participant funds received prior to the ESPP purchase dates are held as company liabilities without interest or other increment. No dividends are paid on employee contributions until shares are purchased.
The company values the ESPP purchases utilizing the Black-Scholes model. The weighted average assumptions used for the following years ended December31 are: 2012 2011 2010 Dividend yield 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.9 % Risk-free interest rate 0.11 % 0.16 % 0.20 % Expected life in years 0.5 0.5 0.5 Expected volatility 26 % 17 % 20 % Fair value $ 21.21 $ 19.63 $ 15.70 Compensation expense related to this plan was $2.8 million, $2.5million and $2.1million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, employees purchased 147,858 and 139,596 shares, respectively.
12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans The company has both tax-qualified and nonqualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that together cover substantially all domestic and certain foreign employees. These plans provide benefits based upon a participants compensation and years of service. The nonqualified plans are made up of the following II-51 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) arrangements: a nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement and a nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement (together, the nonqualified plans). The nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement provides supplemental income to key executives of the company. The benefit is determined by the accumulation of an account balance that results from a percentage of pay credit and interest. No deferrals of pay are required from participants. The balance is paid to a participant after retirement over a 15-year period. The nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement provides benefits to key employees that cannot be provided by the qualified plan due to IRS limitations.
The company amended its domestic tax qualified pension plan and nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement to provide that new hires, effective January1, 2011 or later, will no longer be eligible to participate in the companys defined benefit plans. Beginning January1, 2011, the company also amended its domestic defined contribution plan to provide for a new annual retirement contribution for new hires and established a nonqualified excess defined contribution deferred compensation arrangement for certain new hires. These amendments did not have a material impact on the net pension cost of the company.
The change in benefit obligation, change in fair value of plan assets and funded status for the plans are as follows: 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Benefit obligation - beginning $ 421.9 $ 377.0 Service cost 28.4 26.8 Interest cost 19.5 19.0 Actuarial loss 37.2 23.8 Benefits paid (23.1 ) (22.2 ) Currency/other 1.1 (2.5 ) Benefit obligation - ending $ 485.0 $ 421.9 Fair value of plan assets - beginning $ 298.7 $ 281.6 Actual return on plan assets 38.2 5.4 Company contributions 40.3 32.9 Benefits paid (23.1 ) (22.2 ) Currency/other 1.6 1.0 Fair value of plan assets - ending $ 355.7 $ 298.7 Funded status of the plans, December31 $ (129.3 ) $ (123.2 ) Foreign benefit plan assets at fair value included in the preceding table were $73.3million and $62.2million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The foreign pension plan benefit obligations included in this table were $75.9 million and $65.1 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The benefit obligation for nonqualified plans also included in this table was $69.8million and $63.3million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

II-53 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information for the following years ended December31 are: 2012 2011 2010 Net Cost Discount rate 4.73 % 5.15 % 5.62 % Expected return on plan assets 7.52 % 7.93 % 8.15 % Rate of compensation increase 3.76 % 4.34 % 4.35 % Benefit Obligation Discount rate 3.89 % 4.73 % 5.15 % Rate of compensation increase 3.38 % 3.76 % 4.34 % The companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
The long-term rate of return for plan assets is derived from return assumptions determined for each of the significant asset classes. Under this approach, the historical real returns (net of inflation) on different asset classes are combined with long-term expectations for inflation to determine an expected return on assets within that class. These real rates of return for each asset class reflect the long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income investments. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established based on the combination of these asset class real returns and inflation with proper consideration of the effects of diversification and rebalancing.
Plan Assets Plan assets consist of a diversified portfolio of equity securities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents. The company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by exceeding the interest growth in plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. This consideration involves the use of long-term measures that address both return and risk and are not impacted significantly by short-term fluctuations. Equity investments include a diversified mix of growth, value and small and large capitalization securities. Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
The weighted average target asset allocations for the plans at December31, are as follows: TargetAllocation 2012 2011 Asset Categories Equity securities 61 % 61 % Fixed income securities 33 % 33 % Cash equivalents 6 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % Due to short-term fluctuations in asset performance, allocation percentages may temporarily deviate from these target allocation percentages before a rebalancing occurs. Cash equivalents are targeted at five percent of plan assets and are used to satisfy benefit disbursement requirements and will vary throughout the year.

(B) There were no assets categorized as Level 3 at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Plan assets categorized as Level 2 primarily consist of commingled funds invested in cash equivalents, equities and fixed income securities. These assets are valued using other inputs, such as net asset values provided by the fund administrators or by dealer quotes for similarly-rated instruments that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the remaining term of the plan instruments.
Funding Policy and Expected Contributions The companys objective in funding its domestic tax-qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also consider the relationship between the returns on each asset compared to the plans corresponding expense and consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plans benefit obligation and its corresponding funded status. The company expects to make discretionary contributions of approximately $35million to its qualified plans in 2013.
The total expected benefit payments are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2013 $ 32.2 2014 32.6 2015 32.7 2016 34.6 2017 36.6 2018 through 2022 192.6 II-55 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Defined Contribution Retirement Plans All domestic employees of the company not covered by a collective bargaining agreement who have been scheduled for 1,000 hours of service are eligible to participate in the companys defined contribution plan. The amounts charged to income for this plan were $9.8 million, $7.9million and $9.5 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Outside the United States, the company maintains defined contribution plans along with small pension arrangements that are typically funded with insurance products. These arrangements had a total expense of $2.6million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, the company maintains a long-term deferred compensation arrangement for directors that allows deferral of the annual retainer and meeting fees at the directors election. The company annually accrues for long-term compensation, which is paid out upon the directors retirement from the board. The total 2012 expense for these arrangements was not material.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan The company does not provide subsidized postretirement healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage except for a limited number of former employees. As this plan is unfunded, contributions are made as benefits are incurred. The benefit obligation for this plan was $8.9 million and $9.2 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss were $3.2 million ($2.0 million after tax) for the year ended December31, 2012 and $3.4 million ($2.1 million after tax) for the year ended December31, 2011. The net periodic benefit cost was $0.6 million for each of the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011 and $0.7 million for the year ended December31, 2010.
