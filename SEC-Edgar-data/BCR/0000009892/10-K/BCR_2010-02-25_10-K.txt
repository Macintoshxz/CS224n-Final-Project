Business General C. R. Bard, Inc. (the company or Bard) is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. Charles Russell Bard founded the company in 1907. In 1923, the company was incorporated as C. R. Bard, Inc. and distributed an assortment of urological and surgical products. Bard became a publicly traded company in 1963 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange five years later. The company sells a broad range of products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities. In general, Bards products are intended to be used once and then discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company holds market leading positions in vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products. Bards product strategy is based on the following tenets, which are designed to position the company for continued growth:  Clinician Preference - Bard targets markets where clinicians drive purchasing decisions based on the benefits a product provides to patients.
Product Leadership - The company pursues opportunities in markets where products that consistently provide superior clinical outcomes and medical economic value can attain a leadership position.
Market Growth - Bard focuses its investments in fast growing and/or under-served markets.
Competitive Advantage - The company strives to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through product quality and innovation, intellectual property protection and a core competency in managing complex clinical and regulatory requirements.
Product Diversity - Bard offers a broad, diverse product portfolio to balance the risks inherent in the highly competitive and complex medical device industry.
Bards execution of this strategy has helped the company establish market leadership positions across its four product group categories. In 2008, approximately 81% of the companys net sales were derived from product lines in which the company holds a number one or number two market share position.
Product Group Information The company reports its sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The following table sets forth for the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 the approximate percentage contribution by category to Bards consolidated net sales on a worldwide basis.
FortheYearsEndedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 Vascular 26 % 24 % 24 % Urology 29 % 30 % 30 % Oncology 26 % 25 % 24 % Surgical Specialties 15 % 17 % 18 % Other 4 % 4 % 4 % Total net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % I-1 Table of Contents Vascular Products Bard develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market. Bards line of minimally invasive vascular products includes percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheters, guidewires, introducers and accessories, peripheral vascular stents and stent grafts, vena cava filters and biopsy devices; electrophysiology products, including electrophysiology laboratory systems and diagnostic, therapeutic and temporary pacing electrode catheters; and fabrics, meshes and implantable vascular grafts. The combination of a low-profile catheter and high-pressure balloon have made Bards Conquest  Atlas  and Dorado  PTA catheters popular choices of clinicians for the treatment of arterial venous access stenosis and peripheral artery disease. In the fourth quarter of 2008 the company received Pre-Market Approval (PMA) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for vascular stenting indications for its Flair  AV (arterial venous) Access Stent Graft and its E  Luminexx  Iliac Stent. In January 2008, Bard acquired the LifeStent  family of stents from Edwards Lifesciences Corporation. In 2008, these stents were available in the United States for biliary indications only. In February 2009, the FDA approved a PMA application for superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery indications for the LifeStent  product. Bards G2  and G2  Express vena cava filters are indicated for permanent implant or removal after the threat of blood clots traveling from the lower extremities to a patients lungs has passed. Bards Vacora  device combines the benefits of a vacuum-assisted biopsy sample with a portable, self-contained needle system for the diagnosis of breast tumors. In 2006, the company launched its HD (high-density) Mesh Ablation Catheter in Europe for the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation, the most commonly diagnosed sustained cardiac arrhythmia. In 2008, the company commenced a clinical trial for the approval of the device in the United States.
Urology Products The Foley catheter, which Bard introduced in 1934, remains one of the most important products in the urology field. Foley catheters continue to be marketed in individual sterile packages and in sterile procedural kits and trays, a concept pioneered by Bard. The company has a market-leading position in Foley catheters, currently Bards largest selling urology product. This product line includes the infection control Foley catheter (Bardex  I.C. Foley catheter), which has been proven to substantially reduce the rate of urinary tract infections. The company expanded its infection control franchise in 2007 with the launch of the Agento  IC infection control endotracheal tube for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The device uses Bards proprietary silver coating technology to help prevent VAP without the use of antibiotics. Other urology products include: surgical slings used to treat stress urinary incontinence; natural and synthetic devices for the treatment of pelvic floor and vaginal prolapse; brachytherapy services, devices and radioactive seeds used to treat prostate cancer; urine monitoring and collection systems; ureteral stents; and specialty devices for ureteroscopic procedures and stone removal.
In 2006, Bard acquired Venetec International, Inc. (Venetec) and its StatLock  line of catheter stabilization products. The proprietary StatLock  catheter stabilization device is used primarily to secure peripheral intravenous catheters, thereby reducing restarts and other complications. This device is also used to secure many other types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies. Also, in the third quarter of 2008, the company launched the Dignicare  line of fecal incontinence products.
Oncology Products Bards oncology products cover a wide range of devices used in the treatment and management of various cancers and other diseases and disorders. These include specialty access catheters, ports, vascular access ultrasound devices and enteral feeding devices. The companys specialty access products, used primarily for chemotherapy, serve a well-established market in which Bard holds a leading position. The features and benefits of the companys broad line of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have allowed Bard to capitalize on the fastest growing segment of the specialty access market. The companys PowerPICC  catheters and PowerPort  devices can also be used to inject contrast media at high flow rates. These devices eliminate the need to place an additional catheter in the significant number of PICC and port recipients who also require contrast enhanced CT I-2 Table of Contents (computed tomography) scans. Bards Site-Rite  vascular access ultrasound device and Sherlock  tip locator system help nurses place a PICC catheter at a patients bedside making PICCs a more convenient and cost-effective treatment option.
Surgical Specialty Products Bards surgical specialty products include patches and fixation systems for hernia and other soft tissue repairs, irrigation devices for orthopaedic, laparoscopic and gynecological procedures and products for topical hemostasis. Soft tissue repair products consist of hernia repair implants, including both synthetic and natural tissue configurations, and hernia implant fixation devices. Within the hernia implants line, Bards PerFix  plug has significantly improved the way inguinal or groin hernias are repaired and has reduced procedure times from hours to minutes. Hernia operations using the PerFix  plug can be done in an outpatient setting in as little as 20 minutes. The patient generally can return to normal activity after minimal recovery time. The company also markets products for the repair of ventral or abdominal hernias. Products such as the Ventralex  , Collamend  and Allomax  hernia patches have made Bard a market leader in this segment of the hernia repair market. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company launched the Ventrio  line of ventral hernia repair patches, which includes a resorbable self-deployment ring. In December 2007, Bard began to market the Sepramesh  IP hernia repair patch. The Sepra  bioresorbable adhesion barrier complements Bards ePTFE barrier products to give the company a broader presence in the ventral hernia repair market. Bards line of natural tissue hernia products, including the Collamend  and Allomax  patches, are used to repair complex ventral hernias. In complex hernias, pre-existing infections or high risk of infection precludes the use of synthetic mesh for the repair. In 2007, the company acquired the Permasorb  fixation device, which was the first such device on the market to utilize a bioresorbable tack to attach a hernia repair patch to the host tissue.
International Bard markets its products through subsidiaries and joint ventures in over 100 countries outside the United States. The products sold in the companys international markets include many of the products described above. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the companys international businesses vary with market size and stage of development. The companys principal international markets are in Europe and Japan. Generally the company maintains a geographically-based sales organization that it believes gives it greater flexibility in international markets. Approximately 75% of international sales are of products manufactured by Bard in the United States, Puerto Rico or Mexico. For financial reporting purposes, revenues, income from continuing operations before tax provision and long-lived assets in significant geographic areas are presented in Note 13 Segment Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Bards foreign operations are subject to certain financial and other risks, and international operations in general present complex tax and cash management issues requiring sophisticated analysis to meet the companys financial objectives. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country. Trade receivable balances outside the United States generally are outstanding for longer periods than in the United States. Inventory management is also an important business concern due to the potential for rapidly changing business conditions and currency exposure. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect income and cash flows of international operations. The company attempts to hedge some of these currency exposures to help reduce the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on the business. For more information, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Note 5 Financial Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this Form 10-K.
I-3 Table of Contents Competition The company competes in the therapeutic and diagnostic medical device markets around the world. These global markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. The companys market position depends on its reliable product quality, dependable service and ability to develop products to meet evolving market needs. The company faces a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to smaller manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products, and to a limited extent, reprocessors of single-use medical devices. Many of Bards products are patented or are the subject of patent applications. Patent protection also affects the companys market position.
In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the trend among hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate purchases to enhance purchasing power. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, sales transactions are more complex and tend to involve more significant contracts than in the past. This enhanced purchasing power has placed pressure on product pricing. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Marketing The companys products are distributed domestically directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions as well as through numerous hospital/surgical supply and other medical specialty distributors with whom the company has distribution agreements. In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country. Full-time representatives of the company in domestic and international markets carry on sales promotion. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end users, accounted for approximately 33% of the companys net sales in each of the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, and the five largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 65%, 67% and 70%, respectively, of such sales for the corresponding years. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the companys consolidated net sales in 2008 or in 2007. The largest distributor, Owens & Minor, Inc., accounted for more than 10% of the companys net sales in 2006.
In order to service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels, the company operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the United States and Europe. Orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt. Backlog is not considered a significant issue for the company.
Most of the products sold by the company, whether manufactured by the company or by others, are sold under the BARD  trade name or trademark and/or other trademarks owned by the company. Products manufactured for the company by outside suppliers are generally produced according to the companys specifications.
Available Information The company makes available, free of charge, on its website located at www.crbard.com , its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
The company has adopted, and has posted on its website at www.crbard.com , a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to the companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer and controller. To the extent required, the company intends to disclose any amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Ethics on the website set forth above. In addition, the companys audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, governance committee charter, corporate governance guidelines and business ethics policy are also posted on the companys website at www.crbard.com . A copy of any of these documents is also available, free of charge, upon I-4 Table of Contents written request sent to C. R. Bard, Inc., 730 Central Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974, Attention: Secretary. Shareholders or other interested parties may communicate directly with the Board of Directors, the non-management members of the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The process for doing so is described on the companys website at www.crbard.com .
Regulation The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the companys products are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States. Government regulation, including detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, record keeping and storage and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Medical device laws are in effect in many of the countries in which the company does business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events are also components of most of these regulatory systems. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Healthcare Cost Containment Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures. Difficulty in obtaining coverage, coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can linger for months or even years. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Bards products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it can affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Manufacturers such as Bard rely on insurance reimbursement to create favorable markets for their products, while providers depend on this reimbursement to incorporate new products into their medical practices. As the largest single insurer in the United States, Medicare has a profound influence on the healthcare market. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formulates national and local coverage policy and sets payment rates for facilities and physician providers. Additionally, most private payors will follow the lead of CMS when developing their policies and payment rates. Technology assessment organizations, including the one run by Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are consulted by public and private payors to evaluate the relative merits of new technologies and their impact on net health outcomes in an effort to get as much value for the healthcare dollar as possible.
The processes necessary for a manufacturer to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement are complex and usually vary from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursements to hospitals and ambulatory care facilities are typically made for procedures or episodes of care, which include the costs of devices, supplies and equipment, and provide an incentive for efficient care and careful use of more expensive technologies.
Third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes. In I-5 Table of Contents addition, in an effort to better align incentives for providers, CMS and several large commercial payors have recently adopted policies that will cease to pay for certain preventable, hospital-acquired infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The company believes that the Bardex  IC products are well-positioned to help its customers prevent certain hospital acquired infections. The uncertainty and complexity of future legislation and payor requirements, however, make it difficult to ultimately predict the impact on our business.
Raw Materials The company uses a wide variety of readily available oil-based resins, textiles, alloys and latex materials for conversion into its devices. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers. Certain of the raw materials are available only from single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, sole-source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Bard works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Environment The company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. The operations of the company, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While the company continues to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on the companys competitive position, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. For more information, see Item3. Legal Proceedings.
Employees The company had approximately 11,000 employees as of December 31, 2008.
Seasonality The companys business is not affected to any material extent by seasonal factors.
Research and Development The company is engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of its products are appropriate. The company is dedicated to developing and acquiring technologies that will furnish healthcare providers with a more complete line of products to treat medical conditions through less invasive procedures and in a cost-effective manner. The companys research and development expenditures from continuing operations were $199.1 million in 2008, $135.8 million in 2007, and $144.9 million in 2006. The company evaluates developing technologies in areas where it may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition.
Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to Bards business. The company also relies upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve its competitive position. The company reviews third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
I-6 Table of Contents The company owns an extensive portfolio of patents and has numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of the companys products. The companys policy is to file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries where rights are available and where the company believes it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. The company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Item 1A. Risk Factors An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in evaluating our business. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity, and/or results of operations.
Defects or failures associated with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts, negative publicity regarding the company and litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely affect our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types we produce entail inherent risks. Our products are often used in clinically demanding circumstances with seriously ill patients, and many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition, injury or death of a patient with respect to products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated or improper uses of our products, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information.
These problems could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products and could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal of these products from the body and claims against us for costs associated with the removal. Any recall, whether voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries, could result in significant costs and significant negative publicity. Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals and/or harm our ability to market our products in the future. The foregoing problems could also result in product liability claims being brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class or establish multi-district litigation proceedings, and while we believe that many settlements and judgments may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, there is no guarantee that these amounts will be adequate to cover damages and/or costs, that insurers will be able to pay claims or that coverage will be otherwise available. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits filed or asserted against us, including with respect to our Hernia Repair products. Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals. Any of the foregoing problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
I-7 Table of Contents We face intense competition from other companies, and our inability to continue to effectively develop, acquire and/or market new products and technologies could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The medical device business is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change. Our customers consider many factors when choosing among products, including product features and reliability, product quality, product technology, clinical outcomes, product availability, price and product services provided by the manufacturer. Product introductions, alternative therapies or enhancements by competitors that provide better features and/or lower pricing, may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive.
As a result, we engage in product development and improvement programs to maintain and improve our competitive position. We may not, however, be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new products or technologies that will achieve regulatory approval or receive market acceptance. As part of our competitive strategy, we also pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and products to facilitate our future business strategies. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once a business is acquired, any inability to successfully integrate the business, failure to retain and develop its workforce or failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. If we fail to develop new products, enhance existing products or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and products, or otherwise compete effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Domestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms in the United States and in significant overseas markets such as Germany, Japan, France and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products. Even when we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.
Major third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers resterilize our products intended for a single use or purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us.
Further legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for these procedures, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement issues, would have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. These outcomes, along with cost containment measures, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
I-8 Table of Contents An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business.
We manufacture our products at facilities located throughout the world, some of which are in areas that are prone to hurricanes and other natural disasters. In some cases, certain of our key products are manufactured at one facility. If an event occurred that resulted in damage to one or more of our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. As a result, a reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We are subject to a comprehensive system of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and we could be the subject of an enforcement action or face lawsuits and monetary or equitable judgments.
Our operations are affected by various state, federal and international healthcare, environmental, antitrust, anti-corruption and employment laws, including for example various FDA and international regulations and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). We are subject to periodic inspections to determine compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation requirements, current medical device adverse event reporting regulations and foreign rules and regulations. Product approvals by the FDA and other foreign regulators can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. The failure to comply with regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in FDA Form-483 notices and/or Warning Letters, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, detainment, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the healthcare industry is under scrutiny from state governments and the federal government with respect to industry practices in the area of sales and marketing. If our marketing or sales activities fail to comply with the FDAs regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings from the FDA or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies. In the recent past, medical device manufacturers have been the subject of investigations from state and federal prosecutors related to their relationships with doctors, among other activities or practices. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of a subpoena received by the companys Urological Division relating to the Divisions brachytherapy business. If an enforcement action involving the company were to occur, it could result in penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We operate in many parts of the world and our policies require compliance with the FCPA. Failure to comply with the FCPA could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
In addition, lawsuits by employees, customers, licensors, licensees, suppliers, business partners, distributors, shareholders or competitors with respect to how we conduct our business could be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time-to-time with companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve these disputes on terms favorable to us. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits against the company, including the lawsuit entitled I-9 Table of Contents St. Francis Medical Center, et al. v.
C. R. Bard, Inc., et al . The occurrence of an adverse monetary or equitable judgment or a large expenditure in connection with a settlement of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
We are substantially dependent on patent and proprietary rights and could incur significant costs defending and protecting those rights or face restrictions or additional costs in connection with the sale of our products.
We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards (treble damages under certain circumstances) and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant damage awards, settlement payments or royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business, we believe that an adverse outcome associated with any pending litigation could generally have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in a future period.
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. Although these patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements may not successfully protect our intellectual property, we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications may not result in patents issuing to us, and patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and these patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, we operate in foreign markets where protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weaker than in the United States, and inadequate patent protection in those markets may adversely affect our competitive position. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and we cannot assure you that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to protect our intellectual property or obtain necessary licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. For more information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material impact on our business or results of operations.
Sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 32 percent of our net sales in 2008. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States. As a result, our sales and profitability from our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, including those related to political and economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights.
Current economic instability could adversely affect our operations.
Financial markets and the economies in the United States and internationally have experienced extreme disruption and volatility and conditions could worsen. This has resulted in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability in the market, which could impair our ability to access capital or adversely affect our operations. The economic downturn may also, among other things:  create downward pressure on the pricing of our products;  affect the collection of accounts receivable;  increase the sales cycle for certain of our products;  slow the adoption of new technology; I-10 Table of Contents  adversely affect our customers, causing them to reduce spending; and  adversely affect our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products.
Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
Item 2. Properties The executive offices of the company are located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, in a facility that the company owns. Domestic manufacturing and development units are located in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Utah. Sales offices are in many of these locations as well as others. Outside the United States, the company has plants or offices in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.
The company owns approximately 2.4 million square feet of space in 16 locations and leases approximately 1.3million square feet of space in 50 locations. All of these facilities are well-maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company were to be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of the patent on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for any remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined.
I-11 Table of Contents The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and results of operations for a future period.
On November 27, 2006, the companys Urological Division received a subpoena issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes. The subpoena seeks documents related to the divisions brachytherapy business. The company is cooperating with the governments request and is in the process of responding to the subpoena. At this stage of the inquiry, the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be assessed. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period.
As of February19, 2009, approximately 1,050 federal and 1,285 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,400 plaintiffs, as well as two putative class actions, have been filed or asserted against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  and certain other core hernia repair products (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims). One class action lawsuit consolidates nine previously filed class action lawsuits. The company and certain plaintiffs have agreed to the dismissal of approximately 330 lawsuits in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island. As a result, these lawsuits are not included in the above figures. The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix  Kugel  product beginning in December 2005. The actions generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. Theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek (i) medical monitoring, (ii) compensatory damages, (iii) punitive damages, (iv) a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v) attorneys fees. On June22, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred Composix  Kugel  lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The MDL court subsequently determined to include other hernia repair products in the MDL proceeding. Approximately 1,260 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by a substantially equivalent number of plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions.
The Hernia Product Claims are at a preliminary stage. In the vast majority of these cases, we have not yet obtained and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, we are unable to fully evaluate the claims or determine the time frame in which they may be resolved. As in most litigation of this nature, the Hernia Product Claims present a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. The company believes that many settlements and judgments relating to the Hernia Product Claims may be covered in whole or in part under its product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies. There is no guarantee, however, that these amounts will be adequate to cover damages and/or costs, that insurers will be able to pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Hernia Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the Hernia Product Claims will not have a material adverse impact on the companys result of operations in future periods or the companys financial position or liquidity. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
On February 21, 2007, Southeast Missouri Hospital (Southeast) filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against the company and another manufacturer, Tyco International, Inc. (Tyco). Tycos motion to dismiss was granted and consequently Tyco is no longer a party to the action. The complaint was later amended to add St. Francis Medical Center (St. Francis) as an additional named plaintiff. The action was re-named as St. Francis Medical Center, et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al.
(Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern District) when the court denied Southeasts motion to serve as a class representative and Southeast was subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit. The court granted St. Franciss motion for class certification and determined the measurement I-12 Table of Contents period for any potential damages. St. Francis alleges that the company conspired to exclude competitors from the market and that the company sought to maintain market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. St. Francis seeks injunctive relief and has presented an expert report that calculates damages of up to approximately $320 million, a figure that the company believes is unsupported by the facts. The companys expert report establishes that, even assuming a determination adverse to the company, the plaintiffs suffered no damages. Any damages awarded under the federal antitrust laws will be subject to statutory trebling. If ultimately successful, St. Franciss attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. The trial was scheduled to commence in April 2009, however the court recently adjourned the trial without setting a new date. At this time, it is not possible to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court ruled that Gore failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The company designs, manufacturers, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad, diversified portfolio of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care health facilities and alternate site facilities in the United States and abroad, principally in Europe and Japan. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company reports sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products.
The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing innovative and differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2008, the companys research and development (R&D) expense, including purchased R&D, was $199.1 million. The company expects R&D expense to continue to increase in the future. The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small to medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may from time-to-time consider acquisitions of larger, established companies under appropriate circumstances. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $185.2million in 2008, including purchased R&D, for the acquisition and license of products and technologies.
Acquisitions and Divestitures On June 12, 2008, the company decided to discontinue the sale of its Salute II hernia fixation device. This decision was based on a strategic review, which considered the continued technical challenges associated with the products manufacture and its overall profitability, as well as an assessment of the timing and impact of alternative devices under development. In connection with this decision, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $40.5 million ($34.9 million after tax).
On June 5, 2008, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Specialized Health Products International, Inc. (Specialized Health Products) for a purchase price of $1.00 per share in cash, totalling $68.4 million, plus direct acquisition costs of $2.3 million. Specialized Health Products manufactures and markets vascular access products, including winged infusion sets, which are used to deliver therapeutic agents through vascular access ports. The acquisition represents a strategic addition to Bards port franchise.
On January 11, 2008, the company acquired the assets of the LifeStent  family of stents from Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (Edwards Lifesciences) for a net cash payment of $73.3 million, plus direct acquisition costs of $3.6 million, and up to $65.0 million in contingent milestone payments, of which $23.0 million was paid in December 2008. In addition, the company received Pre-Market Approval from the FDA in February 2009 for use of the LifeStent  in the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery, which resulted in a contingent milestone payment of $27.0 million. The acquisition represents a strategic addition to Bards portfolio of non-coronary stent and stent graft products that is complementary to the companys current products, call points and technology platforms.
See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
Results of Operations Net Sales Bards 2008 consolidated net sales were $2,452.1 million, an increase of 11% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) over 2007 consolidated net sales of $2,202.0 million. Bards 2007 consolidated net sales increased 11% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) over 2006 consolidated net sales of $1,979.6 million. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below.
II-3 Table of Contents Price changes had the effect of increasing consolidated net sales by 0.2% and 0.1% for 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared to the prior years. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing consolidated net sales by 1.0% and 2.0% for 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared to the prior years. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.

The company believes that the brachytherapy market has been losing procedural share to alternative therapies, a trend that may continue.
Consolidated net sales in 2008 of continence products increased 4% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales in 2007 of continence products increased 13% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net sales in 2008 of soft tissue repair products decreased 1% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year due primarily to: (i) the effect of the hold on the manufacture and the subsequent discontinuance of the sale of the companys Salute II hernia fixation device; and (ii) low growth of the companys hernia repair implants. Consolidated net sales in 2007 of soft tissue repair products grew 2% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year due primarily to: (i) the effect of the companys decision in 2007 to initiate both a voluntary recall and a withdrawal of the companys reusable Salute hernia fixation device from the market; (ii) a constrained supply of the companys disposable Salute II hernia fixation device due to product component issues; and (iii) low growth of the companys hernia repair implants following the Composix  Kugel  patch recall in 2005 and expansions of that recall. The challenges in the soft tissue repair product line may continue.
On December 29, 2005, the company initiated a voluntary Class I product recall of its Bard  Composix  Kugel  Mesh X-Large Patch intended for ventral hernia repair. Following the recall, the FDA conducted an inspection and issued a Form-483 notice to the companys Davol, Inc. subsidiary identifying certain observations. The company completed corrective actions to address the observations.
On March 15, 2006, the company voluntarily expanded the December 29, 2005 recall to include certain manufacturing lots of the large Composix  Kugel  patch and large Composix  circle. In December 2006, the company decided to voluntarily expand the March recall to include additional manufacturing lots and initiated the expanded recall on January 10, 2007.
Following the expanded recall, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection and issued a Form-483 notice to Davol identifying certain observations regarding Davols quality systems. The company completed corrective actions to address the observations. On April 25, 2007, Davol received a Warning Letter from the New England District Office of the FDA resulting from the follow-up inspection. The Warning Letter related specifically to non-conformances in Davols quality systems previously identified in the related Form-483. The Warning Letter stated that, until Davol resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, no premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related will be cleared or approved. Davol presently has no such submissions before the FDA. The company responded to the Warning Letter and completed corrective actions to address the observations. The FDA conducted a planned re-inspection of the Davol facility in 2008, which resulted in the issuance of a Form-483 notice. The company responded to the FDAs observations and has completed corrective actions to address them. The FDA recently notified the company that it was satisfied with the companys responses to the Form-483 notices. The company cannot, however, give any assurance as to the expected date of resolution of the matters included in the Warning Letter. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
II-6 Table of Contents On February 13, 2008, the FDA issued a Form-483 notice to the company in connection with an inspection of the companys manufacturing facility located in Humacao, Puerto Rico. The Form-483 notice identified certain observations regarding the facilitys quality systems. The facility manufactures products for many of the companys divisions and subsidiaries, including soft tissue repair products for the companys Davol subsidiary. The company has responded to the FDA and completed corrective actions to these observations. On July28, 2008, the company received a Warning Letter from the San Juan District office of the FDA. The Warning Letter related specifically to non-conformances in quality systems previously identified in the related Form-483 notice. The Warning Letter stated that, until the company resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, no premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related will be cleared or approved. The company presently has no such submissions before the FDA. The company has responded to the Warning Letter and completed corrective actions to address the observations. However, the company cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Warning Letter and the associated corrective actions or as to the expected date of resolution of the matters included in the Warning Letter. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.

The category also includes royalties and the amortization of intangible assets. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2008 was 38.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2007 of 39.3%. Reductions in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales were attributed primarily to cost improvements partially offset by the impact of incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2008 of approximately 40 basis points. The companys cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2007 was 39.3%, an increase of 50 basis points from the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2006 of 38.8%. The impact of incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2007 contributed approximately 20 basis points of this increase.
Marketing, selling and administrative expense - Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for 2008 were 28.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year due primarily to controlled administrative spending. The companys marketing, selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales for 2007 was 29.3%, a decrease of 180 basis points from the prior year due primarily to controlled administrative spending.
Research and development expense - Research and development expense consists principally of the costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities and purchased R&D arising from the companys business development activities. Purchased II-7 Table of Contents R&D payments may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The following table presents the breakdown of the companys research and development expense for the following years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Research and development $ 149.8 $ 134.2 $ 120.9 Purchased research and development 49.3 1.6 24.0 Total research and development expense $ 199.1 $ 135.8 $ 144.9 Research and development expense in 2008 of $199.1 million represented an 47% increase versus the prior years expense of $135.8 million. Included in the research and development expense for 2008 was purchased R&D of approximately $49.3 million primarily associated with the acquisition of the Lifestent  family of stents from Edwards Lifesciences. Research and development expense in 2007 of $135.8 million represented a 6.3% decrease versus the prior years expenditures of $144.9 million. Included in the research and development expense for 2006 was purchased R&D of approximately $24.0 million.
Interest expense - Interest expense in 2008 was $12.1 million as compared with 2007 interest expense of $11.9 million and 2006 interest expense of $16.9 million. The decline in interest expense in 2007 was the result of decreased borrowings outside the United States.
Other expense (income), net - Other expense (income), net was $29.4 million, $(32.3) million and $40.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These amounts include interest income of $16.5 million, $30.7 million and $27.9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates. The increase in 2007 was due primarily to higher balance of cash and cash equivalents. Other expense (income), net in 2008 also included a non-cash charge of $36.8 million related to the write-off of certain assets as a result of the companys decision to discontinue the sales of the Salute II hernia fixation device. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Other expense (income), net in 2006 also included charges associated with legal settlements of approximately $69.0 million for previously disclosed legal actions. See Note 12, Other Expense (Income), Net of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Income tax provision The companys effective tax rate for 2008 decreased to approximately 24% compared to approximately 30% for 2007. The decrease was due to certain tax positions being effectively settled or remeasured as a result of completion of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination for the tax years of 2003 and 2004. Two tax positions remain under review through the IRS administrative appeals process related to these years. The lower tax rate also reflected the tax effect of purchased R&D charges, primarily associated with the acquisition of the assets of the Lifestent  family of stents from Edwards Lifesciences, partially offset by the tax effect of the Salute II charge. The tax effect of the Salute II charge reflected the write-off of assets, which were primarily located in a low tax jurisdiction. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
As a result of the retroactive application of the research tax credit under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the income tax provision for the year was reduced by approximately $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The companys effective tax rate increased by approximately 10% in 2007 from approximately 20% in 2006 primarily related to the impact of the reduction of the income tax provision in 2006 of approximately $23.8 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years and the resolution of the U.K. audit for the 1999 through 2003 tax years, as well as changes in the mix of income among tax jurisdictions.

These items were partially offset by a reduction in the income tax provision of $28.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, as a result of the completion of the IRS examination for the tax years of 2003 and 2004.
The company reported 2007 consolidated net income of $406.4 million, an increase of 49% from 2006 consolidated net income of $272.1 million. The company reported 2007 diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51% from 2006 diluted earnings per share of $2.55.

These items were partially offset by a reduction in the income tax provision of $23.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, predominately due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash balances and cash provided from operations continue to be the companys primary source of funds. Although the global financial markets and worldwide economies continue to experience extreme disruption and volatility, the company believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financing flexibility. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 592.1 $ 488.4 $ 416.2 Working capital 1,081.1 960.3 844.6 Current ratio 4.96/1 4.41/1 3.92/1 For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company generated cashflow from continuing operations of $516.2 million, $547.4 million and $330.2 million, respectively.

Contractual Obligations A summary of contractual obligations at December31, 2008 are as follows: (dollars in millions) Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5+ Years Forward contracts $ 73.9 $ 73.9 $  $  $  Long-term debt 330.5 10.0 20.1 20.1 280.3 Operating lease obligations 117.5 21.2 33.9 15.3 47.1 Acquisition and investment milestones 62.2 54.7 7.5   Purchase obligations 179.6 142.5 28.5 6.1 2.5 Other long-term liabilities 73.5 6.2 12.3 11.1 43.9 $ 837.2 $ 308.5 $ 102.3 $ 52.6 $ 373.8 The table above does not include $41.3 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $8.7 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.
Forward contracts - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.
Long-term debt - Long-term debt includes expected principal and interest payments. The company has $149.8 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2026 and pay a semi-annual coupon of 6.7%.
Operating lease obligations - The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.
Acquisition and investment milestones - The company enters into various acquisition and investment arrangements, including research and development arrangements, product and intellectual property acquisitions II-10 Table of Contents and business combinations. In connection with some of these activities, the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets. Such payments, when made, are allocated to specific intangible asset categories, assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development, depending on the nature of the arrangement.
Purchase obligations - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business.
Other long-term liabilities - The companys estimate of required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation.
Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result.
Revenue recognition - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Share-Based Compensation - The company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)No.123R, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R). Under this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the company utilizes a binomial model.
Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at grant date with a term equal to the expected term of the stock option.
II-11 Table of Contents The companys expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to the weighted-average option life assumption, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.
Contingencies - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/or costs related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible. There is no guarantee, however, that amounts will be adequate to cover damages and/or costs, that insurers will be able to pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes - The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. Effective January 1, 2007, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). See Note 3 Income Taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. The reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns - The company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and II-12 Table of Contents other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.
It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change.
Acquisitions - The company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets is recorded as goodwill. Purchased R&D is expensed at the date of acquisition if technological feasibility has not been established and no alternative future use exists. The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased R&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For purchased R&D, these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility. When the company acquires net assets that do not constitute a business under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, no goodwill is recognized. The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists. Intangible assets other than goodwill and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Pension Plans - The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.0million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $0.6million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.
New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. FAS 157 was effective beginning in Bards 2008 fiscal year, except for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for which it will be effective at the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The impact of the adoption of FAS 157 was not material to the companys consolidated financial statements and the adoption of the items deferred until fiscal 2009 is not expected to be material.
II-13 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). FAS 141R requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Among the new requirements, FAS 141R requires that acquired in-process research and development be capitalized and recorded as an intangible asset at the acquisition date, that contingent consideration be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, and that transaction costs are to be expensed. FAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. FAS 141R and FAS 160 will be effective as of the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The effects of FAS 141R will depend on future acquisitions. The impact of the adoption of FAS 160 is not expected to be material to the companys consolidated financial statements.
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS 161), which requires enhanced disclosures about a companys derivative and hedging activities. FAS 161 will be effective as of the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The company will adopt the enhanced disclosures as required by FAS 161.
In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1). The FSP addresses whether awards granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two-class method under SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. The FSP requires unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents to be treated as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 will be effective as of the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year and will be retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented. The company does not expect the adoption of the FSP to have a material effect on earnings per share.
In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)-1). The FSP requires additional disclosures about plan assets for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will be effective as of the end of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The company will include the additional disclosures about pension plan assets as required by the FSP.
Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often utilized on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, Warning Letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
II-14 Table of Contents Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above and those under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;  the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products;  the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfully integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions with favorable terms;  the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies;  the ability to maintain or increase research and development expenditures;  the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;  the ability to maintain our effective tax rate and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;  internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others;  changes in factors and assumptions employed in the application of FAS 123R or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns, which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period and, as a result, materially impact the companys results of operations;  changes in factors and assumptions employed in the application of FAS87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, could cause pension cost recorded in future periods to differ from the pension expense recorded in the current period and, as a result, materially impact the companys results of operations;  the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in the companys pension plans and the possibility that the company may need to make additional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the fair value of such assets;  damage to a company facility, which could render the company unable to manufacture one or more products (as the company may utilize only one manufacturing facility for certain of its major products) and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets;  the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms; and  the ability to recover claims from insurance companies.
II-15 Table of Contents Competitive factors, including:  the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant and complex contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad;  development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development, which could negatively impact sales of our products or render one or more of our products obsolete;  technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products;  attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; and  reprocessing by third-party reprocessors of our products designed and labeled for single use.
Difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, including:  the ability to complete planned clinical trials successfully, to develop and obtain regulatory approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates;  lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes, which may result in lost market opportunities;  delays or denials of, or grants of low or reduced levels of reimbursement for, procedures using newly developed products;  the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture, market or distribute existing products;  the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling;  performance, efficacy or safety concerns for existing products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product discontinuations, product withdrawals, recalls, field corrections, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation or declining sales, including adverse events relating to the companys vena cava filters and hernia repair products;  FDA inspections resulting in FDA Form-483 notices and/or Warning Letters identifying deficiencies in the companys current good manufacturing practices and/or quality systems; Warning Letters identifying violations of FDA regulations that could result in product holds, recalls, restrictions on future clearances by the FDA and/or civil penalties;  the failure to obtain, limitations on the use of, or the loss of, patent and other intellectual property rights, and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs;  difficulties obtaining necessary components or raw materials used in the companys products and/or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components or raw materials, including oil-based resins or other interruptions of the supply chain; and  customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products, which can result in the companys inability to sell products to or contract with large hospital systems, integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organizations.
Governmental action, including:  the impact of continued healthcare cost containment;  new laws and judicial decisions related to healthcare availability, payment for healthcare products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to II-16 Table of Contents the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce or eliminate reimbursements for procedures that use the companys products;  changes in the FDA and/or foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;  the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the healthcare industry in general or the company in particular;  changes in the tax or environmental laws or standards affecting our business;  changes in the law that could require facility upgrades or process changes and could affect production rates and output; and  compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with environmental laws, including regulations regarding air emissions, waste water discharges and solid waste.

II-17 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December31, 2008 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $3.4 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $2.1million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.
In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. Note holders had a one-time option to redeem the notes at par value on December 1, 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, approximately $0.2 million of the notes were redeemed. The market value of the notes approximated $158.1 million at December 31, 2008. Assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes would have approximated $142.5 million or $176.1million, respectively, on December 31, 2008.
II-18 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

II-26 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations - C. R. Bard, Inc. (the company or Bard) is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sales of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities.
Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of most foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November 30. No events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries during the months of December 2008, 2007 or 2006 that materially affected the financial position or results of operations of the company. The company has no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation.
Related Parties - In 1972, the company formed an equally-owned joint venture, Medicon Inc. (Medicon) with Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd to distribute Bards products in Japan. Bard accounts for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. All transactions with Medicon are denominated in U.S. dollars. Bard recorded sales to Medicon of $117.2 million, $106.1 million and $98.1 million for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Bard eliminates the intercompany profits on sales to Medicon until Medicon sells Bards products to a third party. Bard recorded Medicon equity income of $1.9 million, $1.9 million and $0.2 million for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Bard received dividends from Medicon of $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Bards investment in Medicon was $17.2 million and $16.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in accounts receivable are trade receivables due from Medicon for purchases of Bards products of $33.7 million and $29.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The company evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 - In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on how to evaluate prior period financial statement misstatements for purposes of assessing their materiality in the current period. In accordance with SAB 108, the company adjusted its opening retained earnings for 2006 for the reversal of excess accounts receivable, inventory and restructuring reserves of $9.0 million, $17.3million and $6.4million, respectively. All of these adjustments related to reserves established prior to 2001.
II-27 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The impact of each of the items noted above on fiscal 2006 opening retained earnings is presented below.
(dollars in millions) Accounts Receivable Inventory Restructuring Total Cumulative effect on retained earnings as of January 1, 2006, (net of $6.2 taxes) $ 6.0 $ 14.7 $ 5.8 $ 26.5 Foreign Currency - Net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current year-end rates, and revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average monthly rates during each monthly period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and credited or charged directly to a separate component of shareholders investment. Any foreign currency gains or losses related to monetary assets are charged to other expense (income), net. Foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income was $(16.1)million and $82.6million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Revenue Recognition - The companys net sales represent gross sales invoiced to both end-user customers and independent distributors, less certain related charges, including discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. Distributor sales accounted for approximately 33% of the companys net sales in 2008. The company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Charges for discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the revenue is recorded. The accrual for product returns, discounts and other allowances is based on the companys history. The company allows customers to return defective or damaged products. Historically, product returns have not been material. The company grants sales rebates to independent distributors based upon the distributors reporting of end-user sales and pricing. Sales rebates are accrued by the company in the period in which the sale is recorded. The companys rebate accrual is based on its history of actual rebates paid. In estimating rebate accruals, the company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including stated rebate rates. The companys reserves for rebates are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. The company adjusts reserves to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts. Such adjustments impact the amount of net product sales revenue recognized by the company in the period of adjustment.
Shipping and Handling Costs - Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs - Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $3.1million, $3.4 million and $3.3 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in marketing, selling and administrative expense.
II-28 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Research and Development - Research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities and purchased research and development (purchased R&D) costs arising from acquisitions. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Share-Based Compensation - The company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS123R). This statement requires share-based compensation cost to be measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally compensation expense is recognized as expense over the vesting period.
In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to the weighted-average option life assumption, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at grant date with a term equal to the expected term of the stock option.
As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Treasury Stock - In 1998, the company began holding repurchased shares of its common stock as treasury stock. The company accounts for these treasury stock purchases as retirements by reducing retained earnings for the cost of the repurchase. Reissuances of these treasury shares are accounted for as new issuances. There were approximately 16.7 million and 15.9 million treasury shares at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less and amounted to $579.8 million and $458.0 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Investments - Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Investments in certain debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, consistent with managements intent, are reported at cost.
Accounts Receivable - In addition to trade receivables, accounts receivable included $22.5million and $6.6million of non-trade receivables at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic businesses, cost is determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. For all other inventories, cost is determined using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. The difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant.
Depreciation - Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives primarily range from one to 40 years for buildings and II-29 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) improvements and one to 20 years for machinery and equipment. Depreciation expense was approximately $51.3million in 2008, $48.6 million in 2007, and $44.6 million in 2006.
Software Capitalization - Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five to seven years. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment. In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the company capitalizes certain costs associated with internal-use software such as the payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with internal-use software are expensed during the design phase until the point at which the project has reached the application development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The company capitalized $1.7million, $3.8 million and $4.5 million of internal-use software for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Depreciation expense for capitalized software was approximately $11.5million, $12.8 million and $11.9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. Other intangible assets, including patents, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 7 to 21 years, a weighted average of 16 years. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. To the extent carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes.
The company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The company regularly assesses its tax positions. Any reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the tax position is effectively settled.
The companys policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
Income Statement Presentation of Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Government Authorities - The company follows a net basis policy with regard to sales, use, value added or any other tax collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, which excludes them from both net sales and expenses.
Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments - The company recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in each period in current earnings or other comprehensive (loss) income, depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedged transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
II-30 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with future intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. These risks are managed using derivative instruments, mainly through forward currency and option contracts. The company does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculation purposes. No derivative instruments extend beyond December 2009. All of the companys derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments gains or losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and reclassified into earnings on the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. At December31, 2008, all derivative instruments utilized were highly effective hedging instruments because they were denominated in the same currency as the hedged item and because the maturities of the derivative instruments matched the timing of the hedged items.
2. Acquisitions and Divestitures The company acquires businesses, products and technologies to augment its existing product lines. Unaudited pro forma financial information has not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions and divestitures were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis.
Business Acquisitions On June 5, 2008, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Specialized Health Products International, Inc. (Specialized Health Products) for a purchase price of $1.00 per share in cash, totaling $68.4 million, plus direct acquisition costs of $2.3 million. Specialized Health Products manufactures and markets vascular access products, including winged infusion sets, which are used to deliver therapeutic agents through vascular access ports. The acquisition represents a strategic addition to Bards port franchise. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of core technologies of $34.0 million; patents of $11.2 million; deferred tax assets of $9.1 million consisting of a net operating loss carryforward; other net assets of $12.0 million primarily consisting of cash, inventory and accounts receivable; and deferred tax liabilities of $15.8 million primarily associated with acquired intangible assets. The acquired intangible assets will be amortized over their weighted average useful lives of approximately 12 years. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired of $20.2 million was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes.
On January 11, 2008, the company acquired the assets of the LifeStent  family of stents from Edwards Lifesciences Corporation for a net cash payment of $73.3 million, plus direct acquisition costs of $3.6million, and up to $65.0 million in contingent milestone payments. The contingent milestone payments consist of $50.0 million related to regulatory approvals and $15.0 million related to the transfer of manufacturing operations to Bard. The acquisition represents a strategic addition to Bards portfolio of non-coronary stent and stent graft products that is complementary to the companys current products, call points and technology platforms. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The fair value of the assets acquired was approximately $102.3 million. The difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and the initial payments was recognized as an acquisition related liability. This liability will be reduced upon the payment of the contingent milestone payments with the remaining amounts to be recorded as a deferred tax asset and goodwill.
The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of core technologies of $52.0 million; customer relationships of $9.1 million; other assets of $13.1million consisting primarily of inventory and equipment; an acquisition related liability of $25.4 million; and deferred tax liabilities of $16.3 million. Core technologies and customer relationships will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of 15 and 8 years, respectively. In II-31 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) addition, $44.4 million was allocated to purchased R&D for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future use existed at the acquisition date. The purchased R&D relates to the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use of the LifeStent  products in the superficial femoral artery. The company recorded a charge for purchased R&D in research and development expense in its consolidated statements of income. In connection with the write-off of purchased R&D, the company recorded a tax benefit of $16.4 million. The value assigned to purchased R&D was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the product adjusted for the probability of product approval and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The ongoing activity with respect to the future development for this product is not expected to be material to the companys research and development expense.
The contingent milestone payment related to regulatory approvals was amended, which resulted in $23.0million being paid in December 2008. This payment resulted in a decrease to the acquisition related liability of $14.5 million and an increase to deferred tax assets of $8.5 million. In addition, the company received PMA approval in February 2009 for use of the LifeStent  in the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery, which resulted in a contingent milestone payment of $27.0 million. Up to $15.0 million of contingent milestone payments related to the transfer of manufacturing operations to Bard remain at February 26, 2009.
On June 13, 2007, the company acquired the assets of Inrad, Inc.s biopsy marker business for $33.8 million including capitalized acquisition costs for legal and other consulting costs. This product line is included in the companys vascular disease state category. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of intangible assets, primarily core technologies, of $31.5 million; and other assets of $0.6 million. In addition, $1.6 million was allocated to purchased R&D. The acquired intangible assets will be amortized over their weighted average useful lives of approximately 13 years. Goodwill of $0.1 million associated with this transaction was not deductible for tax purposes. In 2008, the company made contingent payments of $0.2 million that were due upon the delivery of certain equipment.
The purchased R&D relates to a biopsy marker device in development at the time of the acquisition. The company recorded the purchased R&D charge in research and development expense in its consolidated statements of income. The value assigned to purchased R&D was determined by identifying a specific purchased R&D project that would be continued and for which (a) technological feasibility had not been established at acquisition date, (b) there was no alternative future use and (c) the fair market value was estimable with reasonable reliability.
On April 7, 2006, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Venetec International, Inc. (Venetec) for approximately $161.2 million including the payment of certain assumed liabilities plus direct acquisition costs of $2.0 million. Venetec designs, develops, manufactures and markets the StatLock  catheter stabilization device product line. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of patents of $72.5 million; other intangible assets of $41.9 million; deferred tax liabilities with the acquired intangibles assets of $29.4 million; and purchased R&D of $6.4 million. The patents and other intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of 15 and 11 years, respectively. Goodwill of $69.8 million associated with this transaction was not deductible for tax purposes.
Asset Disposition On June 12, 2008, the company decided to discontinue the sale of its Salute II hernia fixation device. This decision was based on a strategic review, which considered the continued technical challenges associated with the products manufacturing and its overall profitability, as well as an assessment of alternative hernia fixation devices under development. In connection with this decision, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $40.5million ($34.9 million after tax). This charge consisted of the write-off of patents of $34.6 million and machinery and equipment of $2.2 million, which in total were recorded to other expense (income), net, and inventory of $3.7 million, which was recorded to cost of goods sold.
II-32 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Product Withdrawal On January 31, 2007, the company withdrew from the synthetic bulking market and discontinued sales of the Tegress TM product and has accounted for this withdrawal as a discontinued operation. The withdrawal was based upon a strategic review of the Tegress TM synthetic bulking product, which considered the products limited commercial success to date, significant future clinical costs and uncertain growth potential. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded an impairment charge and related costs associated with Tegress TM of approximately $46.4 million pre-tax.
Condensed financial information related to the discontinued operation for the following years ended December31 are: 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 0.3 $ 5.9 Income (loss) from operations 0.1 (47.0 ) Income tax provision 0.1 (4.6 ) Income (loss) on discontinued operations $  $ (42.4 ) For the year ended December 31, 2007, Tegress TM net cash flows of $5.3 million related to the collection of customer receivables prior to January 31, 2007 and the wind-down of clinical studies, leases and intellectual property matters.
3. Income Taxes The components of income from continuing operations before income taxes for the following years ended December31 consisted of: 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) United States $ 348.0 $ 390.5 $ 204.4 Foreign 201.9 186.8 190.2 $ 549.9 $ 577.3 $ 394.6 The income tax provision for the following years ended December 31 consisted of: 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Current provision Federal $ 120.4 $ 150.1 $ 70.2 Foreign 29.4 28.5 17.5 State 16.5 14.7 7.7 166.3 193.3 95.4 Deferred provision Federal (25.0 ) (13.1 ) (15.5 ) Foreign (3.4 ) (9.7 ) 1.4 State (4.5 ) 0.4 (1.2 ) (32.9 ) (22.4 ) (15.3 ) $ 133.4 $ 170.9 $ 80.1 II-33 Table of Contents C.

The company records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. The company considers future taxable income and the periods over which it must be earned in assessing the need for valuation allowances. In the event the company determines it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made. Although realization is not assured, the company believes it is more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets will be realized.
A reconciliation between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate for the following years ended December31 is: 2008 2007 2006 Federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2 % 2 % 1 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (8 )% (6 )% (10 )% Impact of foreign tax reform on deferred taxes  (1 )%  Resolution of prior period tax items (5 )%  (7 )% Other, net   1 % 24 % 30 % 20 % The companys foreign tax incentives consist of incentive tax grants in Puerto Rico and Malaysia. The Puerto Rico grant was originally effective November 1998. The company applied for a revised grant to be effective as of July 1, 2001, which also provided for a partial exemption from income, property and municipal taxes for a 15-year period effective from the date of revision. In 2002, the company received approval of this revised grant establishing a new lower tax rate for its Puerto Rican manufacturing operations. During 2003, the company applied for a Malaysian high-technology pioneer grant that would provide for a full tax exemption on operational income by Malaysian Inland Revenue for five years. On February 11, 2004, the company was notified by the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry that the companys application was accepted and would be effective retroactive to July 1, 2003. This grant expired on June 30, 2008.
II-34 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The approximate dollar and per share effects of the Puerto Rican and Malaysian grants are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Tax benefit $ 37.5 $ 35.4 $ 30.2 Per share benefit $ 0.37 $ 0.33 $ 0.28 The company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 (FIN48), effective January1, 2007. FIN48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN48 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax benefit from an uncertain position was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained. The company increased its January1, 2007 retained earnings by $5.3million as a result of the adoption of FIN48.
A reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Balance, January 1 $ 55.3 $ 46.4 Additions related to prior year tax positions 11.9  Reductions related to prior year tax positions (30.7 ) (0.7 ) Additions for tax positions of the current year 5.6 10.3 Settlements  (0.7 ) Lapse of statue of limitations (0.8 )  Balance, December 31 $ 41.3 $ 55.3 The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions and faces audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. As of January 1, 2007, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes was approximately $46.4 million plus approximately $8.2 million of accrued interest. As of December31, 2007, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $55.3million, plus approximately $11.7 million of accrued interest. As of December 31, 2008, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $41.3 million (of which $34.0 million would impact the effective tax rate if recognized) plus approximately $8.7 million of accrued interest.
The company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective tax jurisdiction. Within specific countries, the company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities, or subsidiaries operating within the country may be subject to different statute of limitations expiration dates. As of December 31, 2008, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination in the companys major tax jurisdictions are: United States  federal 2003andforward United States  states 2003 and forward Germany 2001 and forward Malaysia 2002 and forward Puerto Rico 2004 and forward United Kingdom 2007 and forward II-35 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The companys federal tax filings have been examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 2005. In 2008, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $28.3 million as a result of the completion of the IRS examination for the tax years of 2003 and 2004. Two tax positions remain under review through the IRS administrative appeals process related to these years. In 2006, the companys income tax provision was reduced by approximately $23.8 million, predominantly due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years as well as the resolution of an audit in the U.K. for the 1999 through 2003 tax years.
The audit of the companys U.K. tax filing for the 2005 year concluded in the first quarter of 2008 with no adjustment by the tax authority, and the statute of limitations for the U.K. tax filing for the 2006 year expired in 2008.
Based upon the outcome of the administrative appeals process and/or the expiration of statutes of limitations, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of previously unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $8.0million within the next 12months.
At December31, 2008, the company had not provided for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations of approximately $1.1billion as it is the companys intention to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings.
4. Earnings per Share The weighted average common shares used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the following years ended December 31 are: 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Weighted average common shares outstanding 99.5 102.7 103.5 Dilutive common share equivalents from share-based plans 3.0 3.2 3.4 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding, assuming dilution 102.5 105.9 106.9 5. Financial Instruments Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments The company enters into readily marketable forward and option contracts with financial institutions to help reduce its exposure to fluctuations between certain currencies. These contracts limit volatility because gains and losses associated with foreign exchange rate movements are generally offset by movements in the underlying hedged item.
A roll forward of the notional value of the companys forward currency and option contracts is as follows: Forwards Options (dollars in millions) Balance, December 31, 2007 $ 126.5 $  New agreements 77.5 63.6 Expired/cancelled agreements (130.1 )  Balance, December 31, 2008 $ 73.9 $ 63.6 At December 31, 2008, the fair value of forward currency and option contracts was recorded in either other current assets or accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of forward currency contracts was $(4.9)million and $(0.8)million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fair value of option contracts was $11.2million at December 31, 2008. During 2008, the company reclassified a loss of approximately $2.3million from II-36 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to either other expense (income), net, or cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income as hedged intercompany balances were settled. The tax effect of this reclassification was approximately $0.7 million. At December 31, 2008, the company had gains of approximately $3.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated balance sheet that are expected to be reclassified into earnings in 2009.
Investments Short-term investments consisted of high-quality corporate debt securities and commercial paper purchased with maturities of less than one year. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity were $72.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. These investments matured during the year ended December 31, 2008. There were no realized gains or losses on short-term investments for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were unrealized gains of $0.3 million and unrealized losses of $0.1 million on short-term investments for the year ended December31, 2007.
Available-for-sale equity securities recorded in other assets were approximately $0.4 million and $2.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following table summarizes the basis used to measure financial instruments at fair value: Balanceat December31, 2008 QuotedPrices in Active Markets for Identical Items Significant Other Observable Inputs (dollars in millions) Equity securities $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $  Forward currency contracts (4.9 )  (4.9 ) Option contracts 11.2  11.2 The fair value of equity securities was measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical items and valued using published market prices unadjusted for transaction costs. The fair value of forward currency and option contracts was measured using significant other observable inputs and valued by reference to similar financial instruments, adjusted for restrictions and other terms specific to each contract.
Concentration Risks The company is potentially subject to financial instrument concentration of credit risk through its cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Concentrations of risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, a significant amount of trade accounts receivable is with the national healthcare systems of several countries. Although the company does not currently foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables, payment is dependent upon the financial stability of those countries national economies. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end users, accounted for approximately 33% of the companys net sales in 2008, and the five largest distributors combined, including the companys Medicon joint venture, accounted for approximately 65% of such sales. One large distributor II-37 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) accounted for approximately 10% and 9% of the companys net sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and represented gross receivables of approximately $38.6 million and $31.7 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
6. Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of: 2008 2007 (dollars in millions) Finished goods $ 165.2 $ 143.6 Work in process 23.3 21.9 Raw materials 86.6 79.2 $ 275.1 $ 244.7 Approximately 65% of the companys inventory costs are determined using LIFO. Consigned inventory was $22.4 million and $18.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
7. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets at December 31 consisted of: 2008 2007 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization (dollars in millions) Patents $ 216.5 $ (62.3 ) $ 247.7 $ (58.9 ) Core technologies 153.1 (22.6 ) 70.3 (11.3 ) Other intangibles 127.3 (48.4 ) 115.3 (37.8 ) $ 496.9 $ (133.3 ) $ 433.3 $ (108.0 ) Amortization expense was approximately $39.6 million, $31.2 million and $26.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the years 2009 through 2013 based on the companys intangible assets as of December 31, 2008 is as follows: 2009 - $40.0 million; 2010 - $37.3 million; 2011 - $35.5 million; 2012 - $35.4 million; and 2013 - $34.4 million.
8. Debt At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the company had $149.8 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2026 and pay a 6.70% semi-annual coupon. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The fair value of the notes approximated $158.1 million at December 31, 2008. Other debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 was $0.8 million, which was reflected in current maturities of long-term debt.
The company maintains a $400 million committed syndicated bank credit facility that expires in June 2012. The credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. There were no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
II-38 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 9. Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. The company accounts for estimated losses with respect to these proceedings when such losses are probable and estimable. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company were to be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of the patent on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.
The company requires limited product warranty accruals as the majority of the companys products are intended for single use. Certain of the companys products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from sale. The company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Actand similar state laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for any remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.
The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and results of operations for a future period.
On November 27, 2006, the companys Urological Division received a subpoena issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud II-39 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) and false claims statutes. The subpoena seeks documents related to the divisions brachytherapy business. The company is cooperating with the governments request and is in the process of responding to the subpoena. At this stage of the inquiry, the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be assessed. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period.
As of February 19, 2009, approximately 1,050 federal and 1,285 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,400 plaintiffs, as well as two putative class actions, have been filed or asserted against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  and certain other core hernia repair products (collectively, the Hernia Products Claims). One class action lawsuit consolidates nine previously filed class actions lawsuits. The company and certain plaintiffs have agreed to the dismissal of approximately 330 lawsuits in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island. As a result, these lawsuits are not included in the above figures. The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix  Kugel  product beginning in December 2005. The actions generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. Theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek (i) medical monitoring, (ii) compensatory damages, (iii) punitive damages, (iv) a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v) attorneys fees. On June22, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred Composix  Kugel  lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The MDL court subsequently determined to include other hernia repair products in the MDL proceeding. Approximately 1,260 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by a substantially equivalent number of plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions.
The Hernia Product Claims are at a preliminary stage. In the vast majority of these cases, we have not yet obtained and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, we are unable to fully evaluate the claims nor determine the time frame in which they may be resolved. As in most litigation of this nature, the Hernia Product Claims present a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. The company believes that many settlements and judgments relating to the Hernia Product Claims may be covered in whole or in part under its product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance carriers. There is no guarantee, however, that these amounts will be adequate to cover damages and/or costs, that insurers will be able to pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Hernia Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the Hernia Product Claims will not have a material adverse impact on the companys result of operations in future periods or the companys financial position or liquidity.
On February 21, 2007, Southeast Missouri Hospital (Southeast) filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against the company and another manufacturer, Tyco International, Inc. (Tyco). Tycos motion to dismiss was granted and consequently Tyco is no longer a party to the action. The complaint was later amended to add St. Francis Medical Center (St. Francis) as an additional named plaintiff. The action was re-named as St. Francis Medical Center, et al.
v. C.
R. Bard, Inc., et al . (Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern District) when the court denied Southeasts motion to serve as a class representative and Southeast was subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit. The court granted St. Franciss motion for class certification and determined the measurement period for any potential damages. St. Francis alleges that the company conspired to exclude competitors from the market and that the company sought to maintain market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. St. Francis seeks injunctive relief and has presented an expert report that calculates damages of up to approximately $320 million, a figure that the company believes is unsupported by the facts. The companys expert report establishes that, even assuming a determination adverse to the company, the II-40 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) plaintiffs suffered no damages. Any damages awarded under the federal antitrust laws will be subject to statutory trebling. If ultimately successful, St. Franciss attorneys are entitled to an award of reasonable fees and costs. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. The trial was scheduled to commence in April 2009, however the court recently adjourned the trial without setting a new date. At this time, it is not possible to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court ruled that Gore failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Because the company considers this matter a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded as of December 31, 2008.

II-43 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Stock Purchase Program and Plan Management Stock Purchase ProgramThe company maintains a management stock purchase program under the 2003 Plan (together with a predecessor stock purchase plan, the MSPP). Under the MSPP, employees at a specified level may purchase, with their eligible annual bonus, common stock units at a 30% discount from the lower of the price of the common stock on July1 of the previous year or on the date of purchase, which occurs on the date bonuses are approved by the Board of Directors. Employees make an election on or before June 30 of the previous year as to the percentage of their eligible annual bonus that will be used to purchase common stock units under the MSPP. The companys predecessor plan provided for the purchase of shares of the companys common stock. Employees are required to utilize at least 25% of their eligible annual bonuses to purchase common stock units under the MSPP to the extent they have not satisfied certain stock ownership guidelines. MSPP shares or units are restricted from sale or transfer for four years from the purchase date. Only shares or units corresponding to the 30% discount are forfeited if the employees employment terminates prior to the end of the four-year vesting period. Dividends or dividend-equivalents are paid on MSPP shares or units, and the participant has the right to vote all MSPP shares. The activity in the MSPP for the year ended December31, 2008 is as follows: Numberof Shares Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue Outstanding - January 1 271,186 $ 61.33 Purchased 53,556 30.87 Vested (91,786 ) 50.32 Forfeited (12,523 ) 60.87 Outstanding - December 31 220,433 $ 59.03 In the third quarter of 2007, the company began using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the expense associated with anticipated 2008 MSPP purchases. The company believes the Black-Scholes model is a more appropriate model to use as a result of the option-like features of the MSPP. For all shares or units associated with the 2007 and prior MSPP purchases, the difference between the market price and the purchase price at the purchase date is amortized ratably over a four-year requisite service period. Beginning with the 2008 MSPP purchases, compensation expense is recognized over a period that will end four years after purchase. The assumptions used for the following years ended December 31 are: 2008 2007 Dividend yield 0.7 % 0.7 % Risk-free interest rate 2.21 % 4.97 % Expected life in years 0.6 0.6 Expected volatility 24 % 22 % Fair value $ 32.53 $ 30.87 Compensation expense related to this program was $7.4 million, $7.2 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

11. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans The company has both tax-qualified and nonqualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that together cover substantially all domestic and certain foreign employees. These plans provide benefits based upon a participants compensation and years of service. The nonqualified plans are made up of the following arrangements: a nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement and a nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement (nonqualified plans). The nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement provides supplemental income to key executives of the company. The benefit is determined by the accumulation of an account balance that results from a percentage of pay credit and interest. No deferrals of pay are required from participants. The balance is paid to a participant after retirement over a 15-year period. The nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement provides benefits to key employees that cannot be provided by the qualified plan due to IRS limitations.
The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans under SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS158). FAS158 requires, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan, with subsequent changes in the funded status recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in shareholders investment. The impact of the adoption of the recognition provisions of FAS158 for the companys defined benefit pension plans reduced accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by $29.1million at December31, 2006. The company adopted the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the companys fiscal year-end 2008. The impact of this measurement date change reduced retained earnings by $3.0million and increased accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by $0.6 million at December31, 2008.

The weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information for the following years ended December 31 are: 2008 2007 2006 Net Cost Discount rate 6.16 % 5.60 % 5.41 % Compensation increase 4.33 % 4.26 % 4.19 % Expected return on plan assets 8.16 % 8.20 % 8.29 % Benefit Obligation Discount rate 6.32 % 6.16 % 5.60 % Rate of compensation increase 4.27 % 4.33 % 4.26 % Assumptions on discount rate - The companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
II-47 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assumptions on expected long-term rate of return - The long-term rate of return for plan assets is derived from return assumptions determined for each of the significant asset classes. Under this approach, the historical real returns (net of inflation) on different asset classes are combined with long-term expectations for inflation to determine an expected return on assets within that class. These real rates of return for each asset class reflect the long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income investments. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established based on the combination of these asset class real returns and inflation with proper consideration of the effects of diversification and rebalancing.
Investment Targets - Plan assets consist of a diversified portfolio of equity securities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents. Plan assets did not include any company securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average actual and target asset allocations for the plans at December 31, are as follows: ActualAllocation TargetAllocation 2008 2007 2008 2007 Asset Categories Equity securities 58.5 % 64.9 % 60.7 % 61.3 % Fixed income securities 38.8 % 33.0 % 33.3 % 33.4 % Cash and other 2.7 % 2.1 % 6.0 % 5.3 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Due to short-term returns, the investment mix may temporarily fall outside of the targets pending rebalancing to the long-term targets. Cash investment balances are targeted at five percent and are used to satisfy benefit disbursement requirements and will vary throughout the year. There were contributions made to plans in December 2008 that were not fully invested as of December 31, 2008, and those amounts are not reflected in the percentages shown above. In the first quarter of 2009, the company will reallocate the contributions consistent with plan investment target levels.
Investment Strategies - The company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by exceeding the interest growth in plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. This consideration involves the use of long-term measures that address both return and risk and are not impacted significantly by short-term fluctuations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity investments include a diversified mix of growth, value and small and large capitalization securities. Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
Funding Policy and Expected Contributions - The companys objective in funding its domestic tax-qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also consider the relationship between the returns on each asset compared to the plans corresponding expense and consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plans benefit obligation and its corresponding funded status. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2009 pension funding. While the company does not expect it will be required to fund any of its pension plans in 2009, it expects to make discretionary contributions of approximately $25.0 million to its qualified plans.
II-48 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC.

The amounts charged to income for this plan amounted to $8.4 million, $7.5 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Outside the United States, the company maintains defined contribution plans and small pension arrangements that are typically funded with insurance products. These arrangements had a total 2008 expense of $1.7 million. In addition, the company maintains a long-term deferred compensation arrangement for directors that allows deferral of the annual retainer and meeting fees at the directors election. The company annually accrues for long-term compensation, which is paid out upon the directors retirement from the board. These arrangements had a total 2008 expense of $2.0 million.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan The company does not provide subsidized postretirement healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage except for a limited number of former employees. As this plan is unfunded, contributions are made as benefits are incurred.
