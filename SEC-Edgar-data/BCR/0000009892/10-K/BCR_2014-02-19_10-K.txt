Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules IV-1 EXHIBIT INDEX IV-2 SIGNATURES IV-6 Table of Contents PART I Item1. Business General C. R. Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Bard) are engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. Charles Russell Bard founded the company in 1907. In 1923, the company was incorporated as C. R. Bard, Inc. and distributed an assortment of urological and surgical products. Bard became a publicly traded company in 1963 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange five years later. Currently, the company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. In general, Bards products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company participates in the markets for vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products. Bards product strategy is based on the following tenets, which are designed to position the company for continued growth:  Clinician Preference - Bard targets markets where clinicians drive purchasing decisions based on the benefits a product provides to patients;  Product Leadership - The company pursues opportunities in markets where products that consistently provide superior clinical outcomes and medical economic value can attain a leadership position;  Market Growth - Bard focuses its investments in fast-growing and/or under-served markets;  Competitive Advantage - The company strives to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through product quality and innovation, intellectual property protection and a core competency in managing complex clinical and regulatory requirements; and  Product Diversity - Bard offers a broad, diverse product portfolio to balance the risks inherent in the highly competitive and complex medical device industry.
Bards execution of this strategy has helped the company establish market leadership positions across its four product group categories. In 2013, approximately 80% of the companys net sales were derived from product lines in which the company holds a number one or number two market share position.
Product Group Information The company reports its sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The following table sets forth for the three years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 the approximate percentage contribution by category to Bards consolidated net sales on a worldwide basis.

Vascular Products Bards vascular products cover a wide range of minimally invasive devices for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and heart arrhythmias. These products include: percutaneous transluminal angioplasty I-1 Table of Contents (PTA) catheters, chronic total occlusion (CTO) catheters, guidewires, fabrics, meshes, introducers and accessories; valvuloplasty balloons; peripheral vascular stents, covered stents and vascular grafts; vena cava filters; biopsy devices; and temporary pacing electrode catheters. In November 2013, Bard closed on the sale of certain assets (including its electrophysiology laboratory systems and diagnostic and therapeutic catheters) and liabilities of its electrophysiology division to Boston Scientific Corporation, retaining only the guidewire and temporary pacing electrode lines. Bards low-profile catheter and high-pressure balloon technology has made Conquest  , Atlas  and Dorado  PTA catheters leading choices of clinicians for the treatment of arterial venous access stenosis and other PVDs. In December 2011, Bard acquired Lutonix, Inc., a development stage company specializing in drug coated balloon technology for the treatment and prevention of vascular disease. Bard started selling this device in Europe in 2012 and is conducting the first investigational device exemption trial in the United States. The companys Ultraverse  and VascuTrak  PTA catheters and Crosser  CTO catheter give Bard one of the broadest offerings in the small-vessel segment of the PVD market. Bards line of peripheral vascular stents, covered stents and vascular grafts includes the Flair  AV (arterial venous) Access Stent Graft, E  Luminexx  and LifeStar  Iliac Stents, and the LifeStent  family of stents approved for use in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries. Bards vena cava filters product line includes devices that can be either permanently implanted or retrieved after the threat of blood clots traveling from the lower extremities to a patients lungs has passed. Bard offers a market leading portfolio of automatic core needle biopsy devices including MaxCore  and Magnum  . Bards Vacora  and Finesse  devices combine the benefits of a vacuum-assisted biopsy technology with a portable, self-contained needle system for the diagnosis of breast tumors. Bard offers a wide variety of products across the percutaneous breast biopsy and tissue marker segments. The EnCor  and EnCor Enspire  breast biopsy systems allow for ultrasound-, stereotactic- and MRI-guided breast biopsy procedures, and Bards breast tissue markers include the SenoMark  , StarchMark  and Gel Mark  product lines.
Urology Products Bards urology products include basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. The Foley catheter, which Bard introduced in 1934, remains one of the most important products in the urology field. The company has a market-leading position in Foley catheters, including the infection control Foley catheter (Bardex  I.C. Foley catheter), which has been proven to substantially reduce the rate of urinary tract infections. In November 2013, Bard acquired Rochester Medical Corporation and its line of intermittent self-catheters and male external catheters. Other urology products include: surgical slings used to treat stress urinary incontinence; fecal incontinence products; devices for the treatment of pelvic floor and vaginal prolapse; brachytherapy services, devices and radioactive seeds used to treat prostate cancer; intermittent urinary drainage catheters, urine monitoring and collection systems; ureteral stents; and specialty devices for stone removal procedures.
The company also markets the proprietary line of StatLock  catheter stabilization devices, which are used primarily to secure peripheral intravenous catheters, thereby reducing restarts and other complications. These devices are also used to secure many other types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies, including Foley catheters. In November 2011, the company acquired Medivance, Inc. whose Arctic Sun  system with proprietary ArcticGel  pads provides Targeted Temperature Management  therapy to patients requiring therapeutic hypothermia.
Oncology Products Bards oncology products cover a wide range of devices used in the treatment and management of various cancers and other diseases and disorders. These include specialty vascular access catheters and ports, vascular access ultrasound devices, dialysis access catheters and enteral feeding devices. The companys specialty vascular access products, used primarily for chemotherapy, serve a well-established market in which Bard holds a leading position. The features and benefits of the companys broad line of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have allowed Bard to capitalize on this important segment of the specialty vascular access market. The companys PowerPICC  catheters and PowerPort  devices can also be used to inject contrast media at high flow rates. These devices eliminate the need to place an additional catheter in the significant number of PICC and port recipients who also require contrast enhanced CT (computed tomography) scans. Bards Site-Rite  vascular access ultrasound device and Sherlock  tip locator system help nurses place a PICC at a patients I-2 Table of Contents bedside, making PICCs a more convenient and cost-effective treatment option. The companys 3CG Tip Confirmation System can be used in place of imaging technologies such as x-rays to confirm proper placement of the PICC prior to treatment.
Surgical Specialty Products Bards surgical specialty products include implanted grafts and fixation devices for hernia and soft tissue repairs. The companys soft tissue repair products consist of hernia repair grafts, including both synthetic and natural-tissue configurations, and hernia fixation devices. Bard has a full line of products for inguinal (groin) hernias including the Perfix  Plug and 3D Max  product lines. Bard also has the Phasix line of products, which includes advanced polymer technology based on a fully absorbable platform that is absorbed naturally by the body over time. The company also markets products for the repair of ventral (abdominal) hernias including the Ventrio  , Ventrio  ST, Ventralex  , Ventralex  ST and Ventralight  ST synthetic grafts. In 2011, the company launched the ECHO PS  Positioning System which helps facilitate mesh deployment in laparoscopic surgical repair. Bards line of natural-tissue products includes the XenMatrix  and Allomax  grafts used to repair complex ventral hernias and soft tissue reconstruction. Among the companys hernia fixation devices is its SorbaFix  product, a bioresorbable-tack fixation device for use in laparoscopic and open surgical procedures. In 2012, Bard acquired Neomend, Inc., whose Progel  surgical sealant is the only FDA-approved product available for intraoperative sealing of air leaks in connection with thoracic surgery. Progel  has also received a CE mark for both lung sealing and as an anti-adhesion barrier. In October 2013, Bard acquired Medafor, Inc. and its Arista  AH plant-based hemostat product line complementing Bards Progel  surgical sealant technology.
International Through subsidiaries and a joint venture, Bard markets its products to customers in over 100 countries outside the United States. The products sold in the international markets include many of the products described above. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the companys international businesses vary with market size and stage of development. The companys principal international markets are currently in Europe and Japan, and the company expects to continue investing to expand sales and marketing resources in order to capitalize on opportunities in other markets, such as certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Generally, the company maintains a geographically-based sales organization that it believes provides greater flexibility in international markets. Approximately 77% of international sales are of products manufactured by Bard in the United States, Puerto Rico or Mexico. For financial reporting purposes, revenues and long-lived assets in significant geographic areas are presented in Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Bards foreign operations are subject to certain financial and other risks, and international operations in general present complex tax and cash management issues. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country. Trade receivable balances outside the United States generally are outstanding for longer periods than in the United States, particularly in Europe. Inventory management is also an important business concern due to the potential for rapidly changing business conditions and currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect income and cash flows of international operations. The company attempts to hedge some of these currency exposures to help reduce the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on the business. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors, Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Competition The company competes in therapeutic and diagnostic medical device markets around the world. These global markets are characterized by rapid changes resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. The companys market position depends on its reliable product quality, dependable service, value proposition and ability to develop products to meet evolving market needs. The company faces a mix of I-3 Table of Contents competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to smaller manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products, and to a lesser extent reprocessors of single-use medical devices. Many of Bards products are patented or are the subject of patent applications. Patent protection also affects the companys market position.
In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the trend among hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate purchases to enhance purchasing power. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. This enhanced purchasing power has placed pressure on product pricing. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Marketing The companys products are distributed domestically directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions, as well as through numerous hospital/surgical supply and other medical specialty distributors with whom the company has distribution agreements. In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country. Full-time representatives of the company in domestic and international markets engage in sales promotion. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end-users, accounted for approximately 37%, 36% and 33% of the companys net sales for the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and the five largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 64%, 65% and 68%, respectively, of distributors sales for the corresponding years. One large distributor accounted for approximately 9% of the companys net sales in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011.
In order to service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels, the company operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the United States and Europe. Orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt. Backlog is not currently a significant issue for the company.
Most of the products sold by the company, whether manufactured by the company or by others, are sold under the BARD  trade name or trademark and/or other trademarks owned by the company. Products manufactured for the company by outside suppliers are generally produced according to the companys specifications.
Available Information The company makes available, free of charge, on its website located at www.crbard.com , its annual reports to shareholders, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The company has adopted, and has posted on its website, a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to the companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer and controller. To the extent required, the company intends to disclose any amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Ethics on its website. In addition, the companys audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, governance committee charter, corporate governance guidelines and business ethics policy are also posted on the companys website. From time-to-time Bard uses its website to distribute company information, including material information. Financial andotherinformation, including material information regarding the company is routinely posted on and accessible at http://investorrelations.crbard.com . In addition, shareholders or interested parties may enroll to automatically receiveemail alerts and other information about Bard by visiting the Email Alert Service section at http://investorrelations.crbard.com . Shareholders, employees or other interested parties may communicate directly with the Board of Directors, the non-management members of the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The process for doing so is described on the companys website.
I-4 Table of Contents Regulation The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the companys products are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States. Government regulation, including detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping and storage and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions.
Medical device laws are in effect in many of the countries in which the company does business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events are also components of most of these regulatory systems. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing.
For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Healthcare Cost Containment Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures. Difficulty in obtaining coverage, coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years.
Bards products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it can affect the products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Manufacturers such as Bard rely on insurance reimbursement to create favorable markets for their products, while providers depend on this reimbursement to incorporate new products into their medical practices. As the largest single insurer in the United States, Medicare has a profound influence on the healthcare market. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formulates national and local coverage policy and sets payment rates for facilities and physician providers. Additionally, most private payors will follow the lead of CMS when developing their policies and payment rates. Technology assessment organizations, including the one run by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are consulted by public and private payors to evaluate the relative merits of new technologies and their impact on net health outcomes in an effort to get as much value for the healthcare dollar as possible.
The processes necessary for a manufacturer to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement are complex and usually vary from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursements to hospitals and ambulatory care facilities are typically made for procedures or episodes of care, which include the costs of devices, supplies and equipment, and provide an incentive for efficient care and careful use of more expensive technologies.
Third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes. In addition, in an effort to better align incentives for providers, CMS and several large commercial payors have recently adopted policies that will cease to pay for certain preventable, hospital-acquired infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The company believes that the Bardex  IC products are well-positioned to help its customers prevent certain hospital acquired infections. However, the uncertainty and complexity of future legislation seeking to reform the health insurance market and the healthcare delivery system make it difficult to ultimately predict the impact on Bards business.
For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
I-5 Table of Contents Raw Materials The company uses a wide variety of readily available oil-based resins, textiles, alloys and latex materials for the manufacture of its devices. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers. Most of the raw materials are available and/or purchased only from single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, sole-source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Bard works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
Environment The company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. The operations of the company, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While the company continues to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, management believes that such compliance will not have a material effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. For more information, see Item3. Legal Proceedings.
Employees The company had approximately 13,000 employees as of December31, 2013.
Seasonality The companys business is not affected to any material extent by seasonal factors.
Research and Development The company is engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its existing products, and to expand the applications for which the uses of its products are appropriate. The company is dedicated to developing and acquiring technologies that will furnish healthcare providers with a more complete line of products to treat medical conditions through less invasive procedures and in a cost-effective manner. The companys research and development expenditures, including acquired in-process research and development, were $295.7 million, $203.2 million and $185.4 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The company evaluates developing technologies primarily in areas where it may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition.
Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to Bards business. The company also relies upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve its competitive position.
The company owns an extensive portfolio of patents and has numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of the companys products. The companys policy is to file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries where rights are available and where the company believes it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. The company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. For more information, see Item1A. Risk Factors.
I-6 Table of Contents Item1A. Risk Factors An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in evaluating our business. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Defects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts, negative publicity regarding the company and litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely affect our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. Loss reserves are difficult to estimate.
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types we produce entail inherent risks. Quality is extremely important to us and to our customers because our products are often used in clinically demanding circumstances with seriously ill patients, and many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Given the circumstances in which our products are often used, defects, failures or quality issues can result in serious and costly consequences. Quality management is essential to prevent defects or failures associated with our products, as well as to improve our products and maintain the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products.
There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition, injury or death of a patient with respect to products that we manufacture or sell, including quality issues, component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated or improper uses of our products, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information.
Any of these issues could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products and could ultimately result in the removal of these products from the body and claims against us for costs associated with the removal. Any recall, whether voluntary or required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar governmental authorities in other countries, could result in significant costs and significant negative publicity. Negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals and/or harm our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. The foregoing problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits including those being brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class or establish multi-district litigation proceedings. We believe that some settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations to us from other parties. Amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. See Item3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits filed or asserted against us, including the Hernia Product Claims, Womens Health Product Claims and Filter Product Claims (each, as defined below). Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture, quality or marketing of our products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals. Any of the foregoing problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Reserves established for estimated losses, including with respect to legal proceedings, do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may I-7 Table of Contents be established from time-to-time, and actual losses may be materially higher or lower than the related reserve. Liabilities in excess of our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
We face intense competition from other companies, and our inability to continue to effectively develop, acquire and/or market new products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
The medical device business is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change. Our customers consider many factors when choosing among products, including features and reliability, quality, technology, clinical outcomes, availability, price and services provided by the manufacturer. Product introductions, alternative therapies or enhancements by competitors that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value and/or offer lower pricing may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry and among our customers could result in greater competition and pricing pressures.
As a result, we engage in product development and improvement programs to maintain and improve our competitive position. We may not, however, be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new products or technologies that will achieve regulatory approval or receive market acceptance. As part of our business strategy, we also pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and products. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once a business is acquired, any inability to successfully integrate the business, failure to retain and develop its workforce or failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. These transactions are inherently risky, and there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. If we fail to develop and successfully manufacture and launch new products, generate satisfactory clinical results, provide sufficient economic value, enhance existing products, or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and products, or otherwise compete effectively, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.
Domestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms or other governmental actions in the United States and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products (such as recent cuts to Medicare reimbursement) and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.
Major third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers resterilize our products intended for a single use or purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us.
I-8 Table of Contents Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the United States and abroad, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. Examples of these reforms or adverse decisions include price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. Any of such reforms or adverse decisions resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices or denials of coverage could have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. These outcomes, along with cost containment measures, could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.
We manufacture our products at facilities located throughout the world, some of which are in areas that are prone to hurricanes and other natural disasters. In some cases, certain of our key products are manufactured at one facility. If an event occurred that resulted in damage to one or more of our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, most components and raw materials are available and/or purchased only from a sole supplier. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost. As a result, a reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
We are subject to a comprehensive system of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and we could be the subject of an enforcement action or face lawsuits and monetary or equitable judgments.
We operate in many parts of the world, and our operations are affected by various state, federal and international healthcare, environmental, antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and employment laws, including, for example, various FDA and international regulations, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act of 2010. We are subject to periodic inspections to determine compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation requirements, current medical device adverse event reporting regulations, and foreign rules and regulations. The failure to comply with these laws and regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer: (i)could result in FDA Form-483 notices and/or warning letters or foreign equivalent, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, detainment, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and/or civil or criminal prosecution, and/or penalties, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims; and (ii)could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market a medical device. Approvals might not be granted for new devices on a timely basis, if at all. Product approvals by the FDA and other foreign regulators can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Regulations are also subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. For example, the FDA recently adopted rules to establish a Unique Device Identification (UDI) system, which will require that most medical devices distributed in the United States carry a unique device identifier. The company expects that adoption of the UDI system will result in significant cost to implement and to maintain compliance. Our failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval for new products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
I-9 Table of Contents The healthcare industry is under continued scrutiny from state, federal and international governments with respect to industry practices in the area of sales and marketing. If our marketing or sales activities fail to comply with the FDAs regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings from the FDA or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies. In the recent past, medical device manufacturers have been the subject of investigations from government agencies related to their relationships with doctors, product marketing and off-label promotion of products, among other activities or practices. If an enforcement action involving the company were to occur, it could result in penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. See Item3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of a matter relating to the companys brachytherapy business and for a description of the subpoenas and Civil Investigation Demands from a number of State Attorneys General seeking information related to certain of the companys products.
In addition, lawsuits by or otherwise involving employees, customers, licensors, licensees, suppliers, business partners, distributors, shareholders or competitors with respect to how we conduct our business could be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time-to-time with companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve these disputes on terms favorable to us. See Item3. Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits against the company. The occurrence of an adverse monetary or equitable judgment or a large expenditure in connection with a settlement of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
We are substantially dependent on patent and proprietary rights and incur significant costs maintaining, defending and protecting these rights. We also may face restrictions or additional costs in connection with the sale of our products.
We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation is generally expensive, complex and can result in significant damage awards (treble damages under certain circumstances), injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products, settlement payments or royalty payments to enable us to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business, we believe that an adverse outcome associated with any pending litigation could generally have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. Although these patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements may not successfully protect our intellectual property, we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications may not result in patents issuing to us, and patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and these patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, we operate in foreign markets where protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weaker than in the United States, and inadequate patent protection in those markets may adversely affect our competitive position. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and we cannot assure you that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any inability to protect our intellectual property or obtain necessary licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or liquidity. For more information, see Item3. Legal Proceedings.
I-10 Table of Contents Our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
Sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 34% of our net sales in 2013. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales, and we intend to continue our expansion into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. As a result, our sales and profitability from our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy (including our plan to continue expanding into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States) are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, and include those related to political and economic conditions (such as those affecting certain countries in Europe), foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
The adoption of healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
In March 2010, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA). The PPACA includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose new and/or increased taxes. Specifically, beginning in 2013, the medical device industry is required to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices. This excise tax had a negative impact on our results of operations in 2013. The PPACA also reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and clinical laboratories, which could reduce medical procedure volumes and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which the company sells its products. While the PPACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, other elements of this legislation, such as Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, make it difficult to determine the overall impact on sales of our products. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The impact of the PPACA and these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.
Failure to successfully implement, manage and/or integrate critical information systems, disruption of these systems or material breaches of the security of systems involved in our operations may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.
We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. We also rely on our and others technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, track customer purchases, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, including infiltration of data centers, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, and financial results.
If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively, fail to implement new systems and/or update or expand existing systems (such as the companys plan to expand its Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, platform more broadly through the company) or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to systems involved in our operations, we could lose existing customers, have I-11 Table of Contents difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
New regulations related to conflict minerals may impact our supply chain, increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products and/or cause us to incur additional expenses.
Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals: tantalum, tin, and tungsten (or their ores) and gold; which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Under the rules, we will be required to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products and to disclose the procedures we employ to make such determinations. The initial disclosure requirement for the 2013 calendar year is effective in May 2014. There will be costs associated with complying with the diligence and disclosure requirements, and there may be costs associated with remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from our suppliers or that we will be able to determine that all of our products are conflict free. As a result, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.
Economic instability could continue to adversely affect the company.
Financial markets and the economies in the United States and internationally may continue to experience disruption and volatility as they have in recent years and conditions could worsen. As a result, the economic environment may, among other things:  create downward pressure on the pricing of our products;  affect the collection of accounts receivable in countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and certain other countries in Europe;  increase the sales cycle for certain of our products;  slow the adoption of new technology;  adversely affect our customers, causing them to reduce spending and/or decrease utilization of our products;  adversely affect our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; and  limit our access to capital on terms acceptable to us.
These conditions may continue in the future. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. See Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Item1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
Item2. Properties The executive offices of the company are located in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Domestic manufacturing and development units are located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Utah. Sales I-12 Table of Contents offices are in many of these locations as well as others. Outside the United States, the company has plants or offices in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the United Kingdom.
The company owns approximately 2.7million square feet of space in 22 locations and leases approximately 1.5million square feet of space in 75 locations. All of these facilities are well-maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them.
Item3. Legal Proceedings General In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings, investigations and claims, including, for example, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant product liability and patent legal claims. At any given time, in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of certain intangible assets on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount. Many of the companys legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Product Liability Matters As of February13, 2014, approximately 480 federal and 320 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 950 plaintiffs, as well as two putative class actions in the United States are currently pending against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  and certain other hernia repair implant products (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims). The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix  Kugel  products beginning in December 2005. One of the U.S. putative class action lawsuits consolidated ten previously-filed U.S. class action lawsuits. Theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)compensatory damages; (iii)punitive damages; (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (v)attorneys fees. In the third quarter of 2013, a settlement was reached with respect to the three pending putative Canadian class actions within amounts previously recorded by the company. Approximately 295 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 430 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions. The Hernia Product Claims also generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products.
In June2007, the Composix  Kugel  lawsuits and, subsequently, other hernia repair product lawsuits, pending in federal courts nationwide were transferred into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
On June30, 2011, the company announced that it had reached agreements in principle with various plaintiffs law firms to settle the majority of its existing Hernia Product Claims. Each agreement was subject to certain conditions, including requirements for participation in the proposed settlements by a certain minimum number of plaintiffs. In addition, the company continues to engage in discussions with other plaintiffs law firms regarding potential resolution of unsettled Hernia Product Claims, and intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation. The company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of the Hernia Product Claims that have not settled, including asserted and unasserted claims and the putative class action lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
I-13 Table of Contents As of February13, 2014, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 10,395 plaintiffs have been filed or asserted against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of certain of the companys surgical continence products for women, including its Avaulta  line of products. In addition, five putative class actions in the United States and four putative class actions in Canada have been filed against the company (all lawsuits, collectively, the Womens Health Product Claims). The Womens Health Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The putative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)compensatory damages; (iii)punitive damages; (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (v)attorneys fees. With respect to certain of these claims, the company believes that one of its suppliers has an obligation to defend and indemnify the company with respect to any product defect liability. In October 2010, the Womens Health Product Claims involving solely Avaulta  products pending in federal courts nationwide were transferred into an MDL in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia (the District Court), the scope of which was later expanded to include lawsuits involving all womens surgical continence products that are manufactured or distributed by the company. The first trial in a state court was completed in July 2012 and resulted in a judgment against the company of approximately $3.6 million. The company has appealed this decision. The first trial in the MDL commenced in July 2013 and resulted in a judgment against the company of approximately $2 million. The company intends to appeal the judgment. During the third quarter of 2013, the company settled one MDL case and one New Jersey state case. The amounts of the settlements are subject to confidentiality requirements. In addition, during the third quarter of 2013, one MDL case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. On January16, 2014, the District Court ordered that the company prepare 200 individual cases for trial, the timing for which is currently unknown. The next MDL trial is scheduled to occur in May 2014, with additional trials scheduled throughout 2014, some of which may be consolidated. The company does not believe that any verdicts or settlements entered to date are representative of potential outcomes of all Womens Health Product Claims. The case numbers set forth above do not include approximately 1,390 generic complaints involving womens health products where the company cannot, based on the allegations in the complaints, determine whether any of those cases involves the companys womens health products. In addition, the case numbers set forth above do not include approximately 2,195 claims that have been threatened against the company but for which complaints have not yet been filed. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Womens Health Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February13, 2014, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by 45 plaintiffs are currently pending against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of the companys vena cava filter products. In addition, three putative class actions were filed against the company in various state courts on behalf of plaintiffs who are alleged to have no present injury (all lawsuits, collectively, the Filter Product Claims). Two of these putative class actions were dismissed during the second quarter of 2013, and class certification was denied for the third putative class action in July 2013. The first Filter Product Claim trial was completed in June 2012 and resulted in a judgment for the company. The company expects additional trials of Filter Product Claims to take place over the next 12 months. During the second quarter of 2013, the company finalized settlement agreements with respect to more than 30 Filter Product Claims, and made payments with respect to such claims within the amounts previously recorded. The case numbers set forth above do not include approximately 160 claims that have been threatened against the company but for which complaints have not yet been filed. While the company intends to vigorously defend the remaining unsettled Filter Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In most product liability litigations of this nature, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding any remaining unsettled product liability matters.
I-14 Table of Contents The company believes that some settlements and judgments, as well as some legal defense costs, relating to product liability matters are or may be covered in whole or in part under its product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance carriers, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations to the company from other parties. In certain circumstances, insurance carriers reserve their rights with respect to coverage, or contest or deny coverage, as has occurred with respect to certain claims. When this occurs, the company intends to vigorously contest disputes with respect to its insurance coverage and to enforce its rights under the terms of its insurance policies, and accordingly, will record receivables with respect to amounts due under these policies, when recovery is probable. Amounts recovered under the companys product liability insurance policies or indemnification arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs relating to claims. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available.
The companys insurance coverage with respect to the Hernia Product Claims has been exhausted. In the first quarter of 2013 the company recorded a non-cash charge of $25.0 million ($24.5 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, for the write-down of an insurance receivable related to a dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers in connection with these claims.
In connection with the Womens Health Product Claims, the company was in dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers relating to an aggregate of $50 million of insurance coverage. In June 2013, the company settled this dispute with no change to the amount of the insurance coverage or the related receivable.
Other Legal Matters Since early 2013, the company has received subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands from a number of State Attorneys General seeking information related to the sales and marketing of certain of the companys products that are the subject of the Hernia Product Claims and the Womens Health Product Claims. The company is cooperating with these requests. Since it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, the company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In November2006, the company received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG), under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes, seeking documents related to the companys brachytherapy business (the Brachytherapy Matter). In January 2012, the company reached a preliminary agreement with the civil and criminal divisions of the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia to resolve claims with respect to the Brachytherapy Matter and recorded a charge of approximately $51.0 million ($40.8 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2011. On May2, 2013, the company settled this matter. The resolution includes agreements with the government that required the company to pay approximately the amount that was previously recorded.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore& Associates Inc.s (Gore) ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135 (the 135 patent). The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the District Court ruled that Gore failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. In March 2009, the District Court doubled the jury award to approximately $371 million for damages through June 2007. The District Court also awarded the company attorneys fees of $19 million and prejudgment interest of approximately $20 million. In addition, the District Court denied Gores remaining motions, including its motions for a new trial and to set aside the jurys verdict. In July 2010, the District Court awarded the company approximately $109 million in additional damages for the period from July 2007 through March 2009. The District Court also assessed a royalty rate of between 12.5% and 20%, depending on the product, that will be used to calculate damages for Gores infringing sales from April 2009 through the expiration of the patent.
I-15 Table of Contents Gore appealed this matter to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Court of Appeals), which on February10, 2012 affirmed the decision of the District Court. Gore filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for a rehearing of its appeal. On June14, 2012, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its February10, 2012 decision, including the ongoing royalty rates as set by the District Court, with the exception of the issue of willfulness with respect to Gores infringement of the 135 patent, which was remanded to the District Court for further consideration. On October12, 2012, Gore filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court requesting a review of the portion of the decision that the Court of Appeals reaffirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Gores petition on January14, 2013.
On January28, 2013, Gore filed with the U.S. District Court a Request for Judicial Notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted Gores previously filed request for a re-examination of the 135patent. On April1, 2013, the USPTO issued a First Office Action initially rejecting all of the claims of the 135patent that are the subject of the re-examination. On July10, 2013, the USPTO issued a Notice of Intent to Issue an Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate upholding the patentability of all re-examined claims of the 135 patent. This action terminated the re-examination proceeding and upheld the claims involved in the re-examination.
On remand of the action from the Court of Appeals, the District Court heard oral argument on June5, 2013 on three motions pending before it  Gores motion requesting a determination that Gores infringement was not willful, Gores motion for a new trial, and the companys motion to execute on the judgment with respect to all amounts other than enhanced damages due to willfulness. On October16, 2013, the District Court denied Gores motion for entry of a judgment holding that Gores infringement was not willful and Gores motion for a new trial. The District Court granted the companys motion to execute on the judgment, holding that all aspects of the judgment relating to infringement were final and non-appealable. The District Court continued its stay on the execution of the judgment with respect to willfulness and the related enhanced damages.
On November1, 2013, Gore paid to the company $894.3 million in cash (the Gore Proceeds), the total amount of the compensatory damages for infringement, including pre- and post-judgment interest, and the royalties accrued through September30, 2013. Gore expressly reserved its right to appeal from the District Courts rulings and notified the company that, if successful on appeal, it would seek to recover the amounts paid to the company. On December5, 2013, Gore filed an appeal in the Court of Appeals on all of the District Courts rulings, including the order denying Gores motion for a new trial.
As of the third quarter of 2013, the company considered both the compensatory damages and the enhanced damages and the royalty awards to be contingent gains. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded a gain of $894.3 million ($557.4 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, based on the District Courts October 2013 rulings and the companys receipt of the Gore Proceeds. In addition, in January 2014, the company received $37.6 million from Gore, representing Gores calculation of royalties for its infringing sales for the quarter ended December31, 2013. This royalty payment will be recorded in the first quarter of 2014. The company has concluded that the chance of Gore establishing its right to recover this cash is remote. The company continues to account for the enhanced damages awarded by the District Court due to Gores willfulness as a contingent gain.
The timing of final resolution of this litigation remains uncertain. The company cannot give any assurances that royalties for Gores future infringing sales will remain at or near historic levels.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under various federal laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state or foreign laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup I-16 Table of Contents costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and/or results of operations.
The company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other legal matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement and mediation discussions taking into consideration developments in the matters and the risks and uncertainties surrounding litigation. These discussions could result in settlements of one or more of these claims at any time.

Overview The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe and Japan are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe are the companys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.
The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2013, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 9.7%. The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consider acquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $498.5million in 2013, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.

For more information on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Divestiture On November1, 2013, the company closed on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its electrophysiology division (the EP Sale) to Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) and received net cash proceeds of $267.4 million. The company recorded to other (income) expense, net, a gain on the sale of $213.0 million ($118.5 million after tax). See Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Legal Developments In connection with the companys ongoing suit against W. L. Gore& Associates, Inc. (Gore) for infringing Bards patent number 6,436,135, and in accordance with Bards motion to execute on the judgment regarding the final and non-appealable issues, which the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (District Court) granted on October17, 2013, Bard and Gore jointly submitted an order to the District Court directing that all funds not related to Gores willful infringement be paid to Bard. On November1, 2013, Gore paid the company $894.3 million in cash (the Gore Proceeds), which amount represented the compensatory damages for infringement, including pre- and post-judgment interest, and the royalties accrued through September30, 2013. In the fourth quarter 2013, the company recorded a gain of $894.3 million ($557.4 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, based on the District Courts October17, 2013 rulings and the companys receipt of the Gore Proceeds. In addition, in January 2014, the company received $37.6 million from Gore, representing Gores calculation of royalties for its infringing sales for the quarter ended December31, 2013. This royalty payment will be recorded in the first quarter of 2014.
During 2013, the company evaluated certain product liability matters based on information currently available, including: the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the company; and the procedural posture and stage of litigation. Based on these, and other factors, the company recorded charges, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net of approximately $400.7 million ($367.6 million after tax), which recognized the estimated costs for certain product liability, including (with respect to such matters) asserted and unasserted claims, as well as costs to administer the settlements related to such matters. The charges exclude any costs associated with all but one putative class action lawsuit against the company.
For more information on legal matters, see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Healthcare Reform Significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the PPACA). The PPACA requires, among other things, the company to pay a 2.3% excise tax on most U.S. medical device sales beginning in 2013. During 2013, the company recorded to marketing, selling and administration expense an excise tax of $29.4 million.
II-4 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Sales Bards 2013 consolidated net sales increased 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis over 2012 consolidated net sales. Bards 2012 consolidated net sales increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) over 2011 consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales by approximately 100basis points and 140 basis points for 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.
Bards 2013 United States net sales of $2,014.1 million increased 2% compared to $1,967.7 million in 2012. Bards 2013 international net sales of $1,035.4 million increased 5% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to $990.4 million in 2012.

Consolidated net sales of soft tissue repair products in 2013 increased 5% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Net sales in this product line in 2013 were favorably impacted by growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and natural-tissue hernia repair products, partially offset by a decline in sales of hernia fixation products, a trend that may continue. Consolidated net sales of soft tissue repair products in 2012 increased 1% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.
Net sales in this product line in 2012 were favorably impacted by growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and natural-tissue breast reconstruction implants, partially offset by declines in natural tissue hernia repair implants and hernia fixation products.
Other Products - The other product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain original equipment manufacturers products.
Costs and Expenses The following is a summary of costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the following years ended December31: 2013 (A) 2012 2011 Cost of goods sold 39.2 % 38.0 % 37.9 % Marketing, selling and administrative expense 30.2 % 27.6 % 27.4 % Research and development expense 9.7 % 6.9 % 6.4 % Interest expense 1.5 % 1.3 % 1.3 % Other (income) expense, net (20.3 )% 1.4 % 9.4 % Total costs and expenses 60.2 % 75.2 % 82.4 % (A) Amounts do not add due to rounding.
Cost of goods sold - Cost of goods sold consists principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the companys products. The category also includes royalties, amortization of intangible assets and the impact of certain hedging activities. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2013 increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year. These costs as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to decreases in selling prices and an increase in spending for targeted investments. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2012 and 2013 increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2011 and 2012 increased cost of goods sold in 2012 as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points over the prior year. These increases were largely offset by cost improvements.
Marketing, selling and administrative expense - Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2013 increased 260 basis points from the prior year primarily due to the new excise tax on U.S. sales of medical devices, targeted investment spending in this area including in emerging markets, and related costs from operations acquired in 2012 and 2013. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 20 basis points from the prior year primarily due to costs from operations acquired in 2011 and continued investments in emerging markets.
Research and development expense - Research and development expense consists principally of the costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities, and IPR&D costs arising from the companys business development activities. IPR&D II-8 Table of Contents payments may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The following table presents a summary of research and development expense for the following years ended December31: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Research and development $ 262.3 $ 199.7 $ 181.9 In-process research and development 33.4 3.5 3.5 Total research and development expense $ 295.7 $ 203.2 $ 185.4 Research and development expense in 2013 increased approximately 31% compared to the prior year period primarily due to targeted investments in this area and costs from operations acquired in 2012 and 2013. The increase in IPR&D in 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to charges of $30.0 million related to the acquisition of early-stage technology and $3.4 million for an impairment charge related to an IPR&D project. Research and development expense in 2012 increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year driven by the operations of acquisitions.
Interest expense - Interest expense in 2013 was $45.0 million as compared with 2012 interest expense of $39.6 million and 2011 interest expense of $36.4 million. The increase in interest expense in 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes in October 2012. In addition, the increase in interest expense in 2012 was due to higher average short-term borrowings than in the prior year.
Other (income) expense, net - Other (income) expense, net, was income of $619.3 million for 2013 and expense of $40.3 million and $271.9 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other (income) expense, net, in 2013 included income of $894.3 million related to the Gore Proceeds and $213.0 million resulting from the gain on the EP Sale, partially offset by expenses of $428.0 million for litigation charges, net of recoveries, $25.0million for annual contributions to the C. R. Bard Foundation, Inc., $17.5 million for divestiture-related charges, $11.3 million for acquisition-related items consisting of integration costs and $6.4 million for asset impairments. Other (income) expense, net, in 2012 included charges related to asset impairments of $22.2 million and net restructuring costs of $17.4 million.
See Note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Income Tax Provision The companys effective tax rate for 2013 was 43.2% compared to 27.6% in 2012 and 35.8% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2013 reflected the tax effects of litigation charges, primarily related to product liability claims, which were substantially incurred in a low tax jurisdiction, and the gains related to the Gore Proceeds and the EP Sale, which were incurred in high tax jurisdictions. See Notes 2 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law on January2, 2013 and retroactively reinstated the research tax credit. Although the reinstatement of this tax credit is retroactive to January1, 2012, the enactment of this legislation in 2013 precluded the company from recording the benefit in 2012. As a result, the companys income tax provision was reduced by approximately $3.7 million in 2013 to recognize the 2012 benefit of this tax credit that would have been recorded in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2011 reflected the tax effect of a charge for legal settlements related to the Hernia Product Claims, which were incurred in a low tax jurisdiction, and a charge related to the Brachytherapy Matter, part of which was not tax deductible. The tax rate in 2011 also reflected a tax benefit of $17.6 million for certain tax positions being settled as a result of the completion of U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations for the tax years from 2005 through 2007 and certain examinations in other jurisdictions.
Net Income and Earnings per Share Available to Common Shareholders The company reported 2013 net income of $689.8 million, an increase of 30% from 2012 net income of $530.1 million. The company reported 2013 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $8.39, an increase of 36% from 2012 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $6.16. Net income in 2013 reflects the Gore Proceeds of $557.4 million, or $6.78 per diluted share, litigation charges, net of recoveries, of $393.5 million, or $4.79 per diluted share, gain on the EP Sale of $118.5 million, or $1.44 per II-9 Table of Contents diluted share, acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of IPR&D charges, integration costs, transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments) of $34.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and a contribution to the C. R. Bard Foundation, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $14.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Net income for 2013 also reflects divestiture-related charges of $12.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, asset impairment charges of $9.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, a $2.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit to the income tax provision associated with the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position as a result of the settlement of the Brachytherapy Matter, and a reversal of certain restructuring costs of $1.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.
The company reported 2012 net income of $530.1 million, an increase of 62% from 2011 net income of $328.0 million. The company reported 2012 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $6.16, an increase of 67% from 2011 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.69. Net income in 2012 reflects asset impairments of $13.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, net restructuring costs of $11.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, and acquisition-related items (purchase accounting adjustments, transaction and integration costs and IPR&D charges) of $8.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Net income for 2012 also reflects an increase to the income tax provision of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, due to the write-down of a tax receivable in a foreign jurisdiction.
Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financial flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December31: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,066.9 $ 896.3 $ 596.4 Working capital $ 1,503.9 $ 1,399.6 $ 773.5 Current ratio 3.56/1 4.13/1 1.84/1 Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $874.0 million and $786.1million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companys committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.
For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,123.3 million, $661.2million and $721.5 million, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the receipt of the Gore Proceeds, payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims that were lower than amounts previously recorded in 2011 and the timing of tax payments, partially offset by a settlement payment for the Brachytherapy Matter previously recorded in 2012. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims settled in 2011, partially offset by improvements in accounts receivable collections.
II-10 Table of Contents During 2013, the company used $288.3 million in cash for investing activities, $190.1 million more than in 2012. During 2012, the company used $98.2 million in cash for investing activities, $674.1 million less than in 2011. Capital expenditures amounted to $69.1 million, $72.6 million and $71.4 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The company spent $498.5 million in 2013, $159.3 million in 2012 and $557.2 million in 2011 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines. In addition, the company received net proceeds from the EP Sale of $267.4 million in 2013. Net cash used in investing activities in 2012 reflects a decrease of $122.1 million related to the release of restricted cash from qualified settlement funds (QSFs) to claimants pursuant to the settlement of certain Hernia Product Claims.
During 2013 and 2012, the company used $663.3 million and $263.2 million in cash for financing activities, respectively, compared to the $3.9 million provided by financing activities in 2011.
Total debt was $1.4 billion at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 40.2%, 42.3% and 40.7% at December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The company spent approximately $738.1 million to repurchase 6,559,195 shares of common stock in 2013 compared to $472.4million to repurchase 4,903,677 shares of common stock in 2012 and approximately $221.8 million to repurchase 2,519,410 shares of common stock in 2011. Purchases of common stock for 2011 also included a payment of $58.9 million in cash remitted to a bank counterparty upon final settlement under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. The company paid cash dividends of $66.5 million, $66.7 million and $64.6 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
In September 2013, the company amended its $600 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2016. The amendment includes an increase in the aggregate principal amount of credit available under the syndicated bank credit facility to $750 million and extends the commitment termination date until September 2018. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December31, 2013, the company was in compliance with this covenant. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December31, 2013 or 2012.
Contractual Obligations Payments due under contractual obligations at December31, 2013, are as follows: (dollars in millions) Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5+ Years Forward contracts $ 75.7 $ 75.7 $  $  $  Long-term debt 1,733.0 41.3 332.2 574.4 785.1 Operating lease obligations 177.2 30.3 50.3 39.3 57.3 Acquisition and related milestones 141.2 13.2 127.0 1.0  Purchase obligations 235.8 195.4 29.0 10.1 1.3 Legal settlements 16.3 16.3    Other long-term liabilities 99.7 8.0 11.0 18.8 61.9 $ 2,478.9 $ 380.2 $ 549.5 $ 643.6 $ 905.6 The table above does not include $58.0 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $6.6 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.
Forward contracts - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.
II-11 Table of Contents Long-term debt - Long-term debt includes expected principal and interest payments, including the effect of an interest rate swap contract.
Operating lease obligations - The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.
Acquisition and related milestones - The company may make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets under various acquisition and related arrangements. The table above excludes amounts for these milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.
Purchase obligations - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course of business.
Legal settlements - Payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims, subject to certain settlement conditions, may be made from QSFs.
Other long-term liabilities - The company estimates required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation.
Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of GAAP results.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially different result.
Revenue Recognition - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
II-12 Table of Contents Royalty revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalty revenue can be objectively determined. If royalty revenue cannot be objectively determined during the quarterly period in which it is earned, then royalty revenue is recognized in the following quarterly period when objective evidence is obtained and the revenue becomes fixed and determinable.
Share-Based Compensation - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option.
As share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Contingencies - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes regarding agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/or costs related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or others will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes - The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions, state taxes and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversed once the statutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material to its income tax provision and results of operations.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns - The company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation II-13 Table of Contents at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the average length of time to collect receivables, customer creditworthiness and current economic and market trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.
It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in the period of change.
Acquisitions - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalized and recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. When the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for as a business combination, no goodwill is recognized.
IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The determination of fair value of IPR&D takes into consideration: the projects stage of completion as of the acquisition date; the timing and cost of R&D work required to complete the project; the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility; and estimated future cash flows. Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the asset and amortization will begin. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset will be written off.
The fair value of the liability for contingent consideration recorded on the acquisition date is based on probability weighted estimated cash flow streams, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The liability for contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in earnings until the contingency is resolved.
The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.
Goodwill - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.
II-14 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Pension Plans - The company sponsors pension plans covering certain domestic and foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.0million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.0million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.
Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.

In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above and those under Item1A. Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: II-15 Table of Contents Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing processes and supply chain programs or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;  the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products;  the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfully integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions on favorable terms;  the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies;  the ability to implement, and realize the benefits of, our prior and planned investments in our business, including research and development expenditures focused on new market categories, and our plan to grow in emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States and acquire growth platforms designed to change the mix of our portfolio towards faster, sustainable long-term growth;  the uncertainty of whether research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;  the ability to reduce exposure and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;  the risk that the company may not successfully implement its expansion of its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information system;  internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others, and projected royalty revenue related to W.L. Gore& Associates Inc.s infringing sales;  changes in factors and assumptions or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns, which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period;  changes in factors and assumptions could cause pension cost recorded in future periods to differ from the pension cost recorded in the current period;  the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in the companys pension plans and the possibility that the company may need to make additional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the fair value of such assets;  damage to a facility where our products are manufactured or from which they are distributed, which could render the company unable to manufacture or distribute one or more products and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets;  the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms;  the ability to recover for claims made to our insurance companies; and  the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities to improve the companys overall cost structure and improve efficiency.
II-16 Table of Contents Competitive factors, including:  the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant and complex contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad;  development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development which could negatively impact sales of our products or render one or more of our products obsolete;  technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products;  attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; and  reprocessing by third-party reprocessors of our products designed and labeled for single use.
Difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, including:  the ability to complete planned and/or ongoing clinical trials successfully, to develop and obtain regulatory approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates;  lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes, which may result in lost market opportunities and/or delayed product launches;  delays or denials of, or grants of low or reduced levels of reimbursement for, procedures using newly developed products;  the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture, market or distribute existing products;  the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling;  performance, efficacy, quality or safety concerns for existing products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product discontinuations, product withdrawals, recalls, field corrections, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation or declining sales, including adverse events and/or concerns relating to the companys vena cava filters, pelvic floor repair products and hernia repair products;  FDA inspections resulting in Form-483 notices and/or warning letters identifying deficiencies in the companys manufacturing practices and/or quality systems; warning letters identifying violations of FDA regulations that could result in product holds, recalls, restrictions on future clearances by the FDA and/or civil penalties;  the failure to obtain, limitations on the use of, or the loss of, patent and other intellectual property rights, and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs;  difficulties obtaining necessary components or raw materials used in the companys products and/or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components or raw materials, including oil-based resins, or other interruptions of the supply chain; and  customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products, which can result in the companys inability to sell products to or contract with large hospital systems, integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organizations.
II-17 Table of Contents Governmental action, including:  the impact of continued healthcare cost containment;  new laws and judicial decisions related to healthcare availability, healthcare reform, payment for healthcare products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce or eliminate reimbursements for procedures that use the companys products;  changes in the FDA and/or foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;  the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the healthcare industry in general or the company in particular;  changes in the tax laws affecting our business, such as proposed comprehensive tax reform in the United States and proposed legislation in multiple jurisdictions resulting from the adoption of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) policies;  changes in the environmental laws or standards affecting our business;  changes in laws that could require facility upgrades or process changes and could affect production rates and output; and  compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with environmental laws, including regulations regarding air emissions, waste water discharges and solid waste.
Legal disputes, including:  disputes over legal proceedings, including our patent infringement suit against W.L. Gore& Associates Inc. (Gore), the outcome of the Gore matters and the timing of final resolution of the Gore matters;  product liability claims, which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including the Hernia Product Claims, the Womens Health Product Claims and the Filter Product Claims;  claims asserting securities law violations;  claims asserting, and/or subpoenas seeking information regarding, violations of law in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid;  derivative shareholder actions;  claims and subpoenas asserting antitrust violations;  environmental claims, including risks relating to accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in the companys manufacturing, sterilization and research activities and the potential for the company to be held liable for any resulting damages; and  commercial disputes, including disputes over distribution agreements, license agreements, manufacturing/supply agreements, development/research agreements, acquisition or sale agreements, and insurance policies.
General economic conditions, including:  international and domestic business conditions;  political or economic instability in foreign countries; II-18 Table of Contents  interest rates;  foreign currency exchange rates;  changes in the rate of inflation; and  instability of global financial markets and economies including Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and other countries in Europe.
Other factors beyond our control, including catastrophes, both natural and man-made, earthquakes, floods, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war.
Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December31, 2013 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $1.2 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $4.6million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.
The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents for which the market values are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt is affected by a change in the medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt including the effect of the related interest rate swap contract effectively converting the 2.875% fixed-rate notes due 2016 to floating-rate instruments approximated $1,435.4 million at December31, 2013. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated $1,366.7 million or $1,504.2million, respectively, on December31, 2013. For additional discussion of market risk, see Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
II-19 Table of Contents Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued in 1992.
Based on its assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013.
The companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on page II-23.

II-28 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations - C. R. Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Bard) are engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company markets its products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities.
Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of C.R.Bard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of most foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November30. No events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries during the months of December 2013, 2012 or 2011 that materially affected the financial position or results of operations of the company. The company has no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation.
Related Parties - The company and Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. are parties to an equally-owned joint venture, Medicon Inc. (Medicon), which distributes Bards products in Japan. Bard accounts for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. All transactions with Medicon are denominated in U.S. dollars. Bard recorded sales to Medicon of $156.3 million, $155.3 million and $139.0 million for the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Bard eliminates the intercompany profits on sales to Medicon until Medicon sells Bards products to a third party. Bard recorded Medicon equity income of $1.0 million, $9.6 million and $3.8million for the years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Bard received dividends from Medicon of $1.6million, $1.8 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Bards investment in Medicon was $23.1 million and $23.7 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Included in accounts receivable are trade receivables due from Medicon for purchases of Bards products of $39.1million and $39.4 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The company evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Foreign Currency - Net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current year-end rates, and revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average monthly rates during each monthly period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and credited or charged directly to a separate component of shareholders investment. Any foreign currency gains or losses related to monetary assets are charged to other (income) expense, net.
Revenue Recognition - The companys net sales represent gross sales invoiced to both end-user customers and independent distributors, less certain related charges, including discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. The company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time II-29 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenue and associated cost are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Royalty revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalty revenue can be objectively determined. If royalty revenue cannot be objectively determined during the quarterly period in which it is earned, then royalty revenue is recognized in the following quarterly period when objective evidence is obtained and the revenue becomes fixed and determinable.
Charges for discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the revenue is recorded. The accrual for product returns, discounts and other allowances is based on the companys history. The company allows customers to return defective or damaged products. Historically, product returns have not been material. The company grants sales rebates to independent distributors based upon the distributors reporting of end-user sales and pricing. Sales rebates are accrued by the company in the period in which the sale is recorded. The companys rebate accrual is based on its history of actual rebates paid. In estimating rebate accruals, the company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including stated rebate rates. The companys reserves for rebates are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. The company adjusts reserves to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts. Such adjustments impact the amount of net product sales revenue recognized by the company in the period of adjustment.
Shipping and Handling Costs - Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.
Advertising Costs - Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $3.2million, $2.1million and $3.0 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is included in marketing, selling and administrative expense.
Research and Development - Research and development expense is comprised of costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities, and acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) arising from acquisitions not accounted for as a business combination. IPR&D arising from a business combination are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the asset and amortization will begin.
Share-Based Compensation - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and amounted to $846.6 million and $773.1 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Accounts Receivable - In addition to trade receivables, accounts receivable included $44.5million and $47.6million of non-trade receivables at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
II-30 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Depreciation - Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives primarily range from three to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 20 years for machinery and equipment. Depreciation expense was $51.1million, $47.0 million and $43.2 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Software Capitalization and Amortization - Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five to seven years. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment. The company capitalizes certain costs associated with internal-use software such as the payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with internal-use software are expensed during the design phase until the point at which the project has reached the application development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The company capitalized $16.3million, $8.6million and $6.4 million of internal-use software for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Amortization expense for capitalized software was $5.8million, $6.6million and $8.6million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Goodwill - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.
Other Intangible Assets - Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 22 years with a weighted average of 13 years. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. To the extent carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
Income Taxes - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. The company regularly assesses its tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions, state taxes and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. Any reserves are adjusted once the statutes of limitation have expired or the tax position is remeasured or effectively settled. The companys policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions as income tax expense.
Income Statement Presentation of Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Government Authorities -The company follows a net basis policy with regard to sales, use, value added or any other tax collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, which excludes them from both net sales and expenses.
II-31 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Treasury Stock - The company accounts for treasury stock purchases as retirements by reducing retained earnings for the cost of the repurchase. Issuances of previously repurchased shares are accounted for as new issuances. There were 39.0million and 34.5million of previously repurchased shares at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Derivative Instruments - The company recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive loss depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedged transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with future intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. These risks are managed using derivative instruments, mainly through forward currency and option contracts. The company does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. None of these derivative instruments extend beyond December 2014. All of these derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings on the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. At December31, 2013, all of these derivative instruments were highly effective hedging instruments because they were denominated in the same currency as the hedged item and because the maturities of the derivative instruments matched the timing of the hedged items.
When applicable, foreign currency exposures that arise from remeasuring intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are mitigated through the use of forward contracts. Hedges of these foreign exchange exposures are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The gains or losses on these instruments are recognized in earnings and are effectively offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged items.
The company may use interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure on its long-term debt. The company maintains an interest rate swap contract with respect to its $250 million of 2.875% notes due 2016. Under this interest rate swap contract, the company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest rates calculated by reference to a notional principal amount of these notes. The companys swap contract is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge. Changes in the fair value of the swap contract offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates.
2. Acquisitions and Divestiture The company acquires businesses, products and technologies to augment its existing product lines and from time-to-time may divest businesses or product lines for strategic reasons. Unaudited pro forma financial information has not been presented because the effects of acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis.
Acquisitions On November14, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rochester Medical Corporation (Rochester Medical), a publicly-held developer and supplier of silicone urinary incontinence and urine drainage products, for a purchase price of $262.3 million. Rochester Medicals products expand Bards existing global urology product portfolio including an intermittent self catheter product line as well as other products used to treat II-32 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) male urinary incontinence. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of: developed technologies of $145.1 million; other intangible assets of $26.8 million, primarily consisting of a license; deferred tax liabilities of $63.1 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; cash of $26.0 million; property, plant and equipment of $21.7 million; deferred tax assets of $9.4 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; and other net assets of $4.7 million. An IPR&D asset of $7.6 million was also recorded for the development of compact intermittent catheters. The fair value of the IPR&D asset was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk, utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate of 14%. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $84.1million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of future applications for expanding the homecare urological product portfolio that did not meet the criteria for separate recognition of IPR&D. Additionally, synergies are expected to result from the alignment of sales call points within the companys sales organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Developed technologies are being amortized over their weighted average estimated useful lives of approximately 14 years. Other intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average estimated useful lives of approximately 14 years. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.9million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expenses. In connection with this acquisition, the company recorded a charge of $7.1 million ($4.6 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, associated with severance-related integration costs. At December31, 2013, the remaining liability for these costs is $2.8 million.

On October1, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Medafor, Inc. (Medafor), a privately-held developer and supplier of plant-based hemostatic agents. Medafors Arista  AH hemostat product provides an alternative to other commercially available hemostats, complement Bards Progel  surgical sealant technology and allow the company to expand its presence in the global surgical hemostat market. The total purchase consideration of $206.3 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $80 million, which is based on specific revenue-based milestones through June30, 2015. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined by utilizing a probability weighted cash flow estimate adjusted for the expected amount and timing of the payment and was not material as of the acquisition date. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of: developed technologies of $85.6 million; deferred tax liabilities of $61.4 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; deferred tax assets of $10.9 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; and other net assets of $11.3 million. An IPR&D asset of $79.6 million was also recorded for the future development of hemostatic agents using Medafors proprietary technology. The fair value of the IPR&D asset was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk, utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate of 16%. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $80.3 million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of future applications for projects and products that did not meet the criteria for separate recognition of IPR&D. Additionally, synergies are expected to result from expanding the market for the companys sealant and hemostat products through its sales organization and customer relationships. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Developed technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 10 years. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $2.2 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expenses. In connection with this acquisition, the company recorded a charge of $4.1 million ($2.6 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, associated with integration costs. The company has not yet finalized the purchase accounting, which may be adjusted as further information about conditions existing at the acquisition date become available.

On July29, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Loma Vista Medical, Inc., a privately-held company specializing in the development and commercialization of aortic valvuloplasty products, which use noncompliant fiber-based balloon technology. The total purchase consideration of $39.4 million included an up-front cash payment of $32.5 million and the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $8.0million. The fair value of the assets acquired resulted in the recognition of: developed technologies of $20.6million; deferred tax liabilities of $14.8 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; goodwill of $8.6 million; and other net assets of $4.8 million. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. An IPR&D asset of $20.2 million was recorded for the development of a next generation valvuloplasty product. The fair value of the IPR&D asset was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk, utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate of 27%. The company has not yet finalized the purchase accounting, which may be adjusted as further information about conditions existing at the acquisition date become available.
On October19, 2012, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Neomend, Inc. (Neomend), a privately-held company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative surgical sealants. The total purchase consideration of $133.7 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $25million, which is based on the achievement of sales-based milestones through 2016. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined by utilizing a probability weighted cash flow estimate adjusted for the expected timing of the payment and was not material as of the acquisition date. Neomends products expand Bards existing surgical specialties product portfolio to include Progel  surgical sealant, the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of intraoperative air leaks in connection with thoracic surgery. Neomends proprietary technology and pipeline provides the opportunity for future clinical indications across a variety of surgical specialty applications.

BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon. Lutonix is conducting an investigational device exemption (IDE) trial approved by the FDA using drug-coated balloons for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease. The Lutonix LEVANT 2 study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center pivotal IDE trial comparing the Lutonix drug-coated balloon to standard balloon angioplasty. Lutonix received the European Conformity regulatory approval (CE mark) in 2011, and Bard started selling the device in Europe in 2012. The company began a larger registry study in Europe and an IDE study in 2013 to support broader marketing claims and obtain additional clinical data. Additional IDE studies are planned. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date.
The purchase price allocation at fair value resulted in the recognition of: IPR&D of $131.5 million; core technologies of $33.4 million; deferred tax assets of $24.7 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; deferred tax liabilities of $59.5 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; and other net assets of $1.6 million. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $166.3 million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of a large potential market for drug-coated PTA balloons in alternate and expanded indications, and other cost synergies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 12 years. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.4 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expense.
The IPR&D assets, which are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, represent the development of drug-coated balloons and the LEVANT 2 clinical trial for use of these balloons in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries. The launch of this device in the United States is currently expected to occur in 2015, subject to regulatory approvals. The fair value of this intangible asset was determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the probability of technological and commercial risk, utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate of 20%. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined by utilizing a probability weighted estimated cash flow stream adjusted for the expected timing of the payment. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the contingent consideration liability will be remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was approximately $73 million and $72 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The underlying probability of payment of the contingent consideration was 75% at both December31, 2013 and 2012.
On November10, 2011, the company acquired Medivance, Inc. (Medivance) for total cash consideration of $255.5 million. Medivance develops and sells critical care products in the Targeted Temperature Management  area. Medivances core product is the ArticSun  , a noninvasive technology that utilizes a proprietary system that incorporates a hydrogel adhesive pad to control a patients core body temperature at a targeted level. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation at fair value resulted in the recognition of: deferred tax assets of $25.0 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; customer relationships of $88.7 million; core technologies of $75.9 million; deferred tax liabilities of $63.3 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; and other net assets of $17.0 million. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $112.2 million. The goodwill recognized includes the value of expanding the market for Medivances products. Synergies are expected to result from the alignment of critical care sales call points and other manufacturing efficiencies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Customer relationships and core technologies are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 13 and 14 years, respectively. Customer relationships are recorded as a component of other intangible assets. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $1.7 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expense. In connection with this acquisition, the company recorded a charge of $1.8 million ($1.1 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, associated with integration costs.
II-35 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) During the fourth quarter of 2011, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ClearStream Technologies Group plc (ClearStream) for total consideration of $69.1 million. ClearStream, based in Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Ireland, develops and sells proprietary products used in angioplasty. The acquisition complemented Bards core competencies and enhanced Bards vascular product portfolio. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and the results of operations have been included in the companys results since October12, 2011, the date on which a controlling interest was obtained. The purchase price allocation at fair value resulted in the recognition of: deferred tax assets of $3.3 million, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards; core technologies and other intangible assets of $29.1 million; deferred tax liabilities of $3.8 million, primarily associated with intangible assets; and other net assets of $11.0 million. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill of $29.5 million. The goodwill recognized is attributable to expected cost synergies and other benefits created by the expanded peripheral vascular product portfolio of the company as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Core technologies and other intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 10 years. The company incurred acquisition-related transaction costs of $2.6 million, which were expensed to marketing, selling and administrative expense. In connection with this acquisition, the company recorded a charge of $2.0 million ($1.8 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, associated with integration costs.
Divestiture On November1, 2013, the company closed on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its electrophysiology division (the EP Sale) to Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) and received net cash proceeds of $267.4 million. The company recorded to other (income) expense, net, a gain on the sale of $213.0 million ($118.5 million after tax). As a result of this transaction, the company derecognized $38.9 million of goodwill, allocated based upon the relative fair value of EP assets. The company recorded divestiture-related charges of $17.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), primarily consisting of severance and other employee termination and consulting costs incurred in connection with the divestiture of EP. Severance costs of $6.7million ($5.2 million after tax) were incurred and substantially all of these costs remained accrued at December31, 2013.
The company is providing contract manufacturing and other transition services to Boston Scientific for up to five years following the closing date, with limited exceptions. Due to the companys continuing involvement in the operations of EP, the criteria for reporting the results of EP as a discontinued operation were not met.
3. Restructuring and Asset Impairments Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company committed to a plan which included the elimination of certain positions and other terminations worldwide. In connection with this plan, the company recorded employee separation costs under the companys existing severance programs and other costs related to one-time termination benefits of $19.2 million ($13.0 million after tax). Substantially all of these costs were cash expenditures paid by the end of 2013. In addition, $2.1 million of these restructuring costs were reversed in 2013.
During the second half of 2011, the company initiated certain restructuring actions, which included the realignment of certain sales functions in the United States. In connection with these actions, the company recorded employee separation costs under the companys existing severance programs of $12.0 million ($8.1million after tax). Substantially all of these costs were cash expenditures paid by the end of 2012. In addition, $1.8 million and $1.6 million of these restructuring costs were reversed in the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
II-36 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Asset Impairments During 2013, the company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $12.3 million ($9.5 million after tax). The company recorded $6.4 million ($4.9 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, for the write-down of certain core technologies; $3.4 million ($2.2 million after tax) to research and development expense for the impairment of an IPR&D project; and $2.5 million ($2.4 million after tax) to cost of goods sold related primarily to the write-down of manufacturing related equipment and inventory.
During 2012, the company recorded to other (income) expense, net, asset impairment charges totaling $22.2million ($13.8 million after tax). These charges consisted of a write-down of $13.2 million ($8.0 million after tax) related to certain core technologies and impairments of $9.0 million ($5.8 million after tax) of assets not related to operations.
Asset impairment charges were measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs that are categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy, which is described further in Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
4. Income Taxes The components of income from operations before income taxes for the following years ended December31 consisted of: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) United States $ 1,291.8 $ 435.1 $ 425.1 Foreign (78.4 ) 297.3 85.7 $ 1,213.4 $ 732.4 $ 510.8 The income tax provision for the following years ended December31 consisted of: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Current provision Federal $ 468.5 $ 115.0 $ 170.0 Foreign 37.2 40.0 23.3 State 57.6 15.6 7.8 563.3 170.6 201.1 Deferred (benefit) provision Federal (29.9 ) 34.2 (18.9 ) Foreign (3.8 ) (4.2 ) (2.7 ) State (6.0 ) 1.7 3.3 (39.7 ) 31.7 (18.3 ) $ 523.6 $ 202.3 $ 182.8 II-37 Table of Contents C.

The company also had various tax credits of $11.2 million with an indefinite life and $13.2 million that expire between 2017 and 2033.
The company records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. The company considers future taxable income and the periods over which it must be earned in assessing the need for valuation allowances. In the event the company determines it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made. At December31, 2013, the valuation allowance primarily related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforward and credits, and to certain other state deferred tax assets.
A reconciliation between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate for the following years ended December31 is: 2013 2012 2011 Federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 4 % 2 % 2 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate 5 % (A) (9 )% (2 )% Legal settlement, non-deductible portion   2 % Other, net (1 )%  (1 )% 43 % 28 % 36 % (A) Reflects tax effects of litigation charges, net, which consist primarily of product liability claims incurred in a low tax jurisdiction.
II-38 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The companys foreign tax incentives consist of incentive tax grants in Malaysia and Puerto Rico. The companys grants in Malaysia and Puerto Rico will expire in 2015 and 2028, respectively. The approximate dollar and per share effects of the Malaysian and Puerto Rican tax grants are as follows: 2013 (A) 2012 2011 (A) (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Tax benefit $ 5.2 $ 53.3 $ 3.7 Per share benefit $ 0.06 $ 0.62 $ 0.04 (A) No tax benefit was recognized from the incentive tax grant in Puerto Rico due to litigation charges, net.
A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows: 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Balance, January1 $ 43.4 $ 45.0 Additions related to prior year tax positions 8.5 1.7 Reductions related to prior year tax positions  (5.3 ) Additions for tax positions of the current year 12.2 7.2 Settlements (2.4 ) (2.8 ) Lapse of statutes of limitation (3.7 ) (2.4 ) Balance, December31 $ 58.0 $ 43.4 The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions and faces audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions and other matters. As of December31, 2013, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes was $58.0 million (of which $45.3 million would impact the effective tax rate if recognized), plus $6.6 million of accrued interest. As of December31, 2012, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $43.4 million plus $4.8million of accrued interest. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions amounted to $1.3million of expense in 2013, a $0.2 million credit in 2012, and a $1.6 million credit in 2011.
The company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statutes of limitation expire. Within specific countries, the company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities, and subsidiaries operating within the country may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates. As of December31, 2013, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination in the companys major tax jurisdictions are: United States  federal 2008andforward United States  states 2008 and forward Germany 2010 and forward Malaysia 2007 and forward Puerto Rico 2009 and forward United Kingdom 2012 and forward II-39 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In 2011, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $17.6million as a result of the completion of the U.S Internal Revenue Service examinations for the tax years from 2005 through 2007 and certain examinations in other jurisdictions. Depending upon open tax examinations and/or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $31.8million within the next 12months.
At December31, 2013, the company did not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign operations of approximately $1.8billion as it is the companys intention to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings outside of the United States. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these permanently reinvested earnings is not practicable.
5. Earnings per Common Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed under the two-class method, which requires nonvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents to be treated as a separate class of securities in calculating EPS. Participating securities include nonvested restricted stock and units, nonvested shares or units under the management stock purchase program, and certain other nonvested stock-based awards. EPS is computed using the following common share information for the following years ended December31: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars and shares in millions) EPS Numerator: Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 689.8 $ 530.1 $ 328.0 Less: Income allocated to participating securities 12.5 10.0 6.1 Net income available to common shareholders $ 677.3 $ 520.1 $ 321.9 EPS Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding 79.3 83.3 85.8 Dilutive common share equivalents from share-based compensation plans 1.4 1.1 1.5 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding, assuming dilution 80.7 84.4 87.3 6. Financial Instruments Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments The company enters into readily marketable forward and option contracts with financial institutions to help reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These contracts limit volatility because gains and losses associated with foreign currency exchange rate movements are generally offset by movements in the underlying hedged item. The notional value of the companys forward currency and option currency contracts was $148.9 million and $128.1 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Interest Rate Derivative Instruments On December20, 2010, the company entered into an interest rate swap contract in connection with a debt offering. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The swap contract effectively converts its 2.875% fixed-rate notes due 2016 to a floating-rate instrument. The notional value of the companys interest rate swap contract is $250.0 million.

II-41 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Fair value is defined as the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The fair value guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy range from Level 1 having observable inputs to Level 3 having unobservable inputs.
The following table summarizes certain financial instrument assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December31: 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Forward currency contracts $ 0.7 $ 1.0 Option currency contracts 1.3 0.6 Interest rate swap contract 8.9 13.3 The fair values were measured using significant other observable inputs and valued by reference to similar financial instruments, adjusted for restrictions and other terms specific to each instrument. These financial instruments are categorized as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the liability for contingent consideration related to acquisitions was $95.7 million and $77.1 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration is primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2013. The fair value was measured using significant unobservable inputs and is categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.
Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value The estimated fair value of long-term debt including the effect of the related swap contract was $1,435.4million and $1,532.2 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The fair value was estimated using dealer quotes for similarly-rated debt instruments over the remaining contractual term of the companys obligation. Long-term debt is categorized as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
Concentration Risks The company is potentially subject to concentration of credit risk through its cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Concentrations of risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers dispersed across many geographic areas. However, accounts receivable balances include sales to government-supported healthcare systems outside the United States. The company continues to monitor sovereign debt issues and economic conditions in Europe and evaluates accounts receivable in certain countries for potential collection risks. Economic conditions and other factors in certain countries in Europe have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these accounts receivable and may require the company to re-evaluate the collectability of these receivables in future periods. The company has experienced significant delays in the collection of accounts receivable associated with the national healthcare systems in Spain, Italy, II-42 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Greece and Portugal. At December31, 2013, the companys accounts receivable, net of allowances, from the national healthcare systems in these countries and amounts past due greater than 365 days are as follows: Accounts Receivable, net GreaterThan 365 Days Past Due (dollars in millions) Spain $ 25.5 $ 7.2 Italy 21.6 2.0 Greece 10.7 3.6 Portugal 4.4 1.9 $ 62.2 $ 14.7 During 2011, the company received $16.8 million of Greek government bonds, net of discount, in settlement of 2007 through 2009 accounts receivable in Greece. During 2011, the company recorded to other (income) expense, net, charges totaling $11.5 million related to other-than-temporary impairments of these bonds. In March 2012, the Greek government approved a private sector bond exchange program for holders of Greek public debt, including those bonds held by the company. As a result, the companys bonds were exchanged for a combination of new Greek government bonds and certain other notes. In July 2012, the company sold these bonds and notes.
Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end-users, accounted for approximately 37% of the companys net sales in 2013, and the five largest distributors combined, including the companys Medicon joint venture, accounted for approximately 64% of distributors sales. One large distributor accounted for approximately 9% of the companys net sales in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. This distributor represented gross receivables of approximately $35.8 million and $40.9 million as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
7. Inventories Inventories at December31 consisted of: 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Finished goods $ 218.3 $ 194.6 Work in process 21.9 19.1 Raw materials 116.0 114.8 $ 356.2 $ 328.5 Consigned inventory was $47.7 million and $47.0 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
8. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets at December31 consisted of: 2013 2012 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization (dollars in millions) Core and developed technologies $ 968.3 $ (271.5 ) $ 717.7 $ (211.2 ) Customer relationships 144.6 (51.4 ) 144.2 (38.8 ) In-process research and development (A) 270.5  167.8  Other intangibles 241.8 (137.4 ) 216.1 (121.2 ) $ 1,625.2 $ (460.3 ) $ 1,245.8 $ (371.2 ) (A) Amounts capitalized as in-process research and development are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
II-43 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amortization expense was $89.5 million, $82.7 million and $63.3 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the years 2014 through 2018 based on the companys amortizable intangible assets as of December31, 2013 is as follows: 2014 - $106.0 million; 2015 - $104.0 million; 2016 - $100.5 million; 2017 - $97.2 million; and 2018 - $93.6 million.
9. Debt Long-term debt at December31 consisted of: 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) 1.375% notes due 2018 $ 499.5 $ 499.4 4.40% notes due 2021 497.5 497.1 2.875% notes due 2016 258.9 263.3 6.70% notes due 2026 149.8 149.8 $ 1,405.7 $ 1,409.6 On October30, 2012, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% senior unsecured notes due 2018. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper and acquisitions.
On December20, 2010, the company issued $750 million senior unsecured notes consisting of $250million aggregate principal amount of 2.875%notes due 2016 and $500million aggregate principal amount of 4.40%notes due 2021. In connection with the offering of these notes, on December15, 2010, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with a bank counterparty to repurchase $750million of the companys outstanding common stock. In September 2011, the company remitted a cash payment of $58.9 million to the bank counterparty upon final settlement under the ASR transaction. The payment to the bank counterparty was recorded as a decrease to shareholders investment, consisting of a decrease of $69.1 million in retained earnings and an increase of $10.2 million in capital in excess of par value.
With the exception of the 6.70% notes due 2026, the notes included in the above table are redeemable in whole or in part at any time, at the companys option at specified redemption prices or, at the holders option, upon change of control triggering event, as defined in the applicable indenture.
In September 2013, the company amended its $600 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2016. The amendment includes an increase in the aggregate principal amount of credit available under the syndicated bank credit facility to $750 million and extends the commitment termination date until September 2018. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December31, 2013, the company was in compliance with this covenant. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December31, 2013 or 2012, respectively.
10. Commitments and Contingencies General In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings, investigations and claims, including, for example, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other II-44 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant product liability and patent legal claims. The company accounts for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings and claims when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of the range. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. At any given time, in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of certain intangible assets on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount. Many of the companys legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
The company requires limited product warranty accruals as the majority of the companys products are intended for single use. Certain of the companys products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from sale. The company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale.
Product Liability Matters As of February13, 2014, approximately 480 federal and 320 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 950 plaintiffs, as well as two putative class actions in the United States are currently pending against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  and certain other hernia repair implant products (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims). The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the Composix  Kugel  products beginning in December 2005. One of the U.S. putative class action lawsuits consolidated ten previously-filed U.S. class action lawsuits. Theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)compensatory damages; (iii)punitive damages; (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (v)attorneys fees. In the third quarter of 2013, a settlement was reached with respect to the three pending putative Canadian class actions within amounts previously recorded by the company. Approximately 295 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 430 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions. The Hernia Product Claims also generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products.
In June2007, the Composix  Kugel  lawsuits and, subsequently, other hernia repair product lawsuits, pending in federal courts nationwide were transferred into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
On June30, 2011, the company announced that it had reached agreements in principle with various plaintiffs law firms to settle the majority of its existing Hernia Product Claims. Each agreement was subject to certain conditions, including requirements for participation in the proposed settlements by a certain minimum number of plaintiffs. In addition, the company continues to engage in discussions with other plaintiffs law firms regarding potential resolution of unsettled Hernia Product Claims, and intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation. The company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of the Hernia Product Claims that have not settled, including asserted and unasserted claims and the putative class action lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February13, 2014, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 10,395plaintiffs have been filed or asserted against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions II-45 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) alleging personal injuries associated with the use of certain of the companys surgical continence products for women, including its Avaulta  line of products. In addition, five putative class actions in the United States and four putative class actions in Canada have been filed against the company (all lawsuits, collectively, the Womens Health Product Claims). The Womens Health Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the products. The putative class actions, none of which has been certified, seek: (i)medical monitoring; (ii)compensatory damages; (iii)punitive damages; (iv)a judicial finding of defect and causation; and/or (v)attorneys fees. With respect to certain of these claims, the company believes that one of its suppliers has an obligation to defend and indemnify the company with respect to any product defect liability. In October 2010, the Womens Health Product Claims involving solely Avaulta  products pending in federal courts nationwide were transferred into an MDL in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia (the District Court), the scope of which was later expanded to include lawsuits involving all womens surgical continence products that are manufactured or distributed by the company. The first trial in a state court was completed in July 2012 and resulted in a judgment against the company of approximately $3.6 million. The company has appealed this decision. The first trial in the MDL commenced in July 2013 and resulted in a judgment against the company of approximately $2 million. The company intends to appeal the judgment. During the third quarter of 2013, the company settled one MDL case and one New Jersey state case. The amounts of the settlements are subject to confidentiality requirements. In addition, during the third quarter of 2013, one MDL case was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. On January16, 2014, the District Court ordered that the company prepare 200 individual cases for trial, the timing for which is currently unknown. The next MDL trial is scheduled to occur in May 2014, with additional trials scheduled throughout 2014, some of which may be consolidated. The company does not believe that any verdicts or settlements entered to date are representative of potential outcomes of all Womens Health Product Claims. The case numbers set forth above do not include approximately 1,390 generic complaints involving womens health products where the company cannot, based on the allegations in the complaints, determine whether any of those cases involves the companys womens health products. In addition, the case numbers set forth above do not include approximately 2,195 claims that have been threatened against the company but for which complaints have not yet been filed. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Womens Health Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
As of February13, 2014, product liability lawsuits involving individual claims by 45 plaintiffs are currently pending against the company in various federal and state jurisdictions alleging personal injuries associated with the use of the companys vena cava filter products. In addition, three putative class actions were filed against the company in various state courts on behalf of plaintiffs who are alleged to have no present injury (all lawsuits, collectively, the Filter Product Claims). Two of these putative class actions were dismissed during the second quarter of 2013, and class certification was denied for the third putative class action in July 2013. The first Filter Product Claim trial was completed in June 2012 and resulted in a judgment for the company. The company expects additional trials of Filter Product Claims to take place over the next 12 months. During the second quarter of 2013, the company finalized settlement agreements with respect to more than 30 Filter Product Claims, and made payments with respect to such claims within the amounts previously recorded. The case numbers set forth above do not include approximately 160 claims that have been threatened against the company but for which complaints have not yet been filed. While the company intends to vigorously defend the remaining unsettled Filter Product Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In most product liability litigations of this nature, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the company has not yet received and reviewed complete II-46 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding any remaining unsettled product liability matters.
The company believes that some settlements and judgments, as well as some legal defense costs, relating to product liability matters are or may be covered in whole or in part under its product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance carriers, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations to the company from other parties. In certain circumstances, insurance carriers reserve their rights with respect to coverage, or contest or deny coverage, as has occurred with respect to certain claims. When this occurs, the company intends to vigorously contest disputes with respect to its insurance coverage and to enforce its rights under the terms of its insurance policies, and accordingly, will record receivables with respect to amounts due under these policies, when recovery is probable. Amounts recovered under the companys product liability insurance policies or indemnification arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs relating to claims. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available.
The companys insurance coverage with respect to the Hernia Product Claims has been exhausted. In the first quarter of 2013 the company recorded a non-cash charge of $25.0 million ($24.5 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, for the write-down of an insurance receivable related to a dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers in connection with these claims.
In connection with the Womens Health Product Claims, the company was in dispute with one of its excess insurance carriers relating to an aggregate of $50 million of insurance coverage. In June 2013, the company settled this dispute with no change to the amount of the insurance coverage or the related receivable.
Other Legal Matters Since early 2013, the company has received subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands from a number of State Attorneys General seeking information related to the sales and marketing of certain of the companys products that are the subject of the Hernia Product Claims and the Womens Health Product Claims. The company is cooperating with these requests. Since it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, the company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
In November2006, the company received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG), under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes, seeking documents related to the companys brachytherapy business (the Brachytherapy Matter). In January 2012, the company reached a preliminary agreement with the civil and criminal divisions of the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Georgia to resolve claims with respect to the Brachytherapy Matter and recorded a charge of approximately $51.0 million ($40.8 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2011. On May2, 2013, the company settled this matter. The resolution includes agreements with the government that required the company to pay approximately the amount that was previously recorded.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore& Associates Inc.s (Gore) ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135 (the 135patent). The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the District Court ruled II-47 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) that Gore failed to prove that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. In March 2009, the District Court doubled the jury award to approximately $371 million for damages through June 2007. The District Court also awarded the company attorneys fees of $19 million and prejudgment interest of approximately $20 million. In addition, the District Court denied Gores remaining motions, including its motions for a new trial and to set aside the jurys verdict. In July 2010, the District Court awarded the company approximately $109 million in additional damages for the period from July 2007 through March 2009. The District Court also assessed a royalty rate of between 12.5% and 20%, depending on the product, that will be used to calculate damages for Gores infringing sales from April 2009 through the expiration of the patent.
Gore appealed this matter to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Court of Appeals), which on February10, 2012 affirmed the decision of the District Court. Gore filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for a rehearing of its appeal. On June14, 2012, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its February10, 2012 decision, including the ongoing royalty rates as set by the District Court, with the exception of the issue of willfulness with respect to Gores infringement of the 135 patent, which was remanded to the District Court for further consideration. On October12, 2012, Gore filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court requesting a review of the portion of the decision that the Court of Appeals reaffirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Gores petition on January14, 2013.
On January28, 2013, Gore filed with the U.S. District Court a Request for Judicial Notice that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted Gores previously filed request for a re-examination of the 135patent. On April1, 2013, the USPTO issued a First Office Action initially rejecting all of the claims of the 135 patent that are the subject of the re-examination. On July10, 2013, the USPTO issued a Notice of Intent to Issue an Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate upholding the patentability of all re-examined claims of the 135patent. This action terminated the re-examination proceeding and upheld the claims involved in the re-examination.
On remand of the action from the Court of Appeals, the District Court heard oral argument on June5, 2013 on three motions pending before it  Gores motion requesting a determination that Gores infringement was not willful, Gores motion for a new trial, and the companys motion to execute on the judgment with respect to all amounts other than enhanced damages due to willfulness. On October16, 2013, the District Court denied Gores motion for entry of a judgment holding that Gores infringement was not willful and Gores motion for a new trial. The District Court granted the companys motion to execute on the judgment, holding that all aspects of the judgment relating to infringement were final and non-appealable. The District Court continued its stay on the execution of the judgment with respect to willfulness and the related enhanced damages.
On November1, 2013, Gore paid to the company $894.3 million in cash (the Gore Proceeds), the total amount of the compensatory damages for infringement, including pre- and post-judgment interest, and the royalties accrued through September30, 2013. Gore expressly reserved its right to appeal from the District Courts rulings and notified the company that, if successful on appeal, it would seek to recover the amounts paid to the company. On December5, 2013, Gore filed an appeal in the Court of Appeals on all of the District Courts rulings, including the order denying Gores motion for a new trial.
As of the third quarter of 2013, the company considered both the compensatory damages and the enhanced damages and the royalty awards to be contingent gains. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the company recorded a gain of $894.3 million ($557.4 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, based on the District Courts October 2013 rulings and the companys receipt of the Gore Proceeds. In addition, in January 2014, the company received $37.6 million from Gore, representing Gores calculation of royalties for its infringing sales for the quarter ended December31, 2013. This royalty payment will be recorded in the first quarter of 2014. The company has concluded that the chance of Gore establishing its right to recover this cash is remote. The company continues to account for the enhanced damages awarded by the District Court due to Gores willfulness as a contingent gain.
II-48 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The timing of final resolution of this litigation remains uncertain. The company cannot give any assurances that royalties for Gores future infringing sales will remain at or near historic levels.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under various federal laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state or foreign laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and/or results of operations.
Litigation Reserves The company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other legal matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement and mediation discussions taking into consideration developments in the matters and the risks and uncertainties surrounding litigation. These discussions could result in settlements of one or more of these claims at any time.
The company recorded a charge, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net, of approximately $293.0 million ($276.0 million after tax) in the second quarter of 2013, which recognized the estimated costs for certain of the product liability matters discussed above under the heading Product Liability Matters, including (with respect to such matters) asserted and unasserted claims, and costs to administer the settlements related to such matters. The company recorded this charge after evaluating these matters based on information then currently available, including: the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the company; and the procedural posture and stage of litigation. Since recording that charge, based on information currently available regarding these, and other factors including the increase in the number of claims, the company recorded an additional charge, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net, of approximately $108.0 million ($92.0 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2013, which recognized the estimated additional costs for certain of these product liability matters, including (with respect to such matters) asserted and unasserted claims, and costs to administer the settlements related to such matters. These charges exclude any costs associated with all but one putative class II-49 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) action lawsuit. The company cannot give any assurances that the actual costs incurred with respect to these product liability matters will not exceed the related amounts accrued. With respect to product liability claims that are not resolved through settlement, the company intends to vigorously defend against such claims, including through litigation. The company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of any of its product liability matters, including asserted and unasserted claims and the putative class action lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Accruals for product liability and other legal matters amounted to $662.4 million, of which $117.5 million was recorded to accrued expenses, and $158.1 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The company made total payments of $177.1million to qualified settlement funds (QSFs), of which $19.5 million were made during 2013, subject to certain settlement conditions, for certain Hernia Product Claims. Payments to QSFs were recorded as a component of restricted cash. Total payments of $160.8 million from these QSFs have been made to qualified claimants, of which $28.2 million were made during 2013. In addition, other payments of $29.4 million have been made to qualified claimants, of which $18.8 million were made during 2013.
The company recorded receivables related to product liability matters amounting to $234.9 million and $45.6 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A substantial amount of the receivable at December31, 2013 is the subject of a dispute with a supplier who has contested at least, in part, its obligation to defend and indemnify the company, which the company refutes. After considering the following factors (as appropriate): the nature of the claims, relevant contracts, relevant legal issues, the advice and judgment of outside legal counsel, and other pertinent factors, the company believes that it should collect these receivables.
The company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible losses or range of losses, if any, arising from certain existing product liability matters and other legal matters. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely and an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight. With respect to all putative class action lawsuits relating to product liability matters, the company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the following reasons: (i)all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; (ii)the company has not received and reviewed complete information regarding all or certain of the plaintiffs and their medical conditions; and/or (iii)there are significant factual issues to be resolved. In addition, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class.
The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. The minimum annual rentals under the terms of these leases are as follows: 2014 - $30.3 million; 2015 - $26.2million; 2016 - $24.1 million; 2017 - $20.1 million; 2018 - $19.2 million and thereafter - $57.3million. Total rental expense for operating leases approximated $29.4 million in 2013, $25.9 million in 2012 and $25.1 million in 2011.
11. Share-Based Compensation Plans The company may grant a variety of share-based payments under the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan of C.R.Bard, Inc., as amended and restated (the LTIP) and the 2005 Directors Stock Award Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc., as amended and restated (the Directors Plan) to certain directors, officers and employees. At the companys Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April17, 2013, the shareholders authorized an additional 2,000,000 shares for issuance under the LTIP. The total number of remaining shares at December31, 2013 that may be issued under the LTIP was 4,328,678 and under the Directors Plan was 35,707. Awards under the LTIP may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock and other stock-based awards. Awards under the Directors Plan may be in the form of stock awards, stock options or stock appreciation rights. The company also has two employee stock purchase programs.
II-50 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Amounts recognized for share-based compensation for the following years ended December31 are: 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Total cost of share-based compensation plans $ 61.5 $ 52.0 $ 55.4 Amounts capitalized in inventory and fixed assets (1.8 ) (1.5 ) (1.5 ) Amounts charged against income for amounts previously capitalized in inventory and fixed assets 1.8 1.6 1.6 Amounts charged against income $ 61.5 $ 52.1 $ 55.5 Amount of related income tax benefit recognized in income $ 21.5 $ 18.8 $ 18.7 As of December31, 2013, there were $112.8 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to share-based payment arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The company has sufficient shares to satisfy expected share-based payment arrangements in 2014.
Stock Options The company grants stock options to certain employees and may grant stock options to directors with exercise prices equal to the average of the high and low prices of the companys common stock on the date of grant. These stock option awards generally have requisite service periods of up to four years, and ten-year contractual terms. Certain stock option awards granted in prior years provided for accelerated vesting after a minimum of two years subject to performance conditions, which were met. Summarized information regarding total stock option activity and amounts for the year ended December31, 2013 is as follows: Options Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term(years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (millions) Outstanding - January1 6,284,738 $ 82.83 Granted 843,616 134.42 Exercised (1,781,789 ) 76.03 Canceled/forfeited (116,996 ) 90.18 Outstanding - December31 5,229,569 $ 93.30 6.7 $ 214.4 Exercisable 3,326,580 $ 83.19 5.3 $ 168.8 The company uses a binomial-lattice option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the companys stock option grants for the following years ended December31 are: 2013 2012 2011 Dividend yield 0.7 % 0.8 % 0.8 % Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 0.9 % 1.03 % Expected option life in years 6.5 7.0 7.0 Expected volatility 21 % 21 % 23 % Option fair value $ 29.83 $ 20.22 $ 19.82 Compensation expense related to stock options was $15.9 million, $15.8million and $19.7 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013, there were $35.2 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options. These costs are expected to be II-51 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 946,698, 1,152,890 and 489,648 options, respectively, vested with a weighted-average fair value of $20.69, $21.49 and $22.80, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $78.0 million, $42.1 million and $88.7 million, respectively.
Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $135.5million, $89.6 million and $106.5 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises was $26.7million, $14.5 million and $31.6 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Restricted Stock and Units Restricted stock awards entitle employees to voting and dividend rights. Restricted stock units entitle employees to dividend rights. Certain restricted stock awards have performance features. Restricted stock and unit grants have requisite service periods of between four to seven years. Compensation expense related to restricted stock and units was $20.0 million, $18.7 million and $22.1 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013, there were $41.1million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock and unit awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The activity in the nonvested restricted stock and unit awards for the year ended December31, 2013 is as follows: Numberof Shares Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue Outstanding - January 1 1,055,625 $ 87.76 Granted 189,031 134.73 Vested (322,075 ) 88.44 Forfeited (50,948 ) 96.94 Outstanding - December 31 871,633 $ 98.34 Other Restricted Stock Units Certain other restricted stock units have requisite service periods of between four and seven years. No voting or dividend rights are associated with these grants until the underlying shares are issued upon vesting. Compensation expense related to these awards was $10.0 million, $5.1 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013, there were $23.5 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to these nonvested restricted stock unit awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately four years. The activity in the nonvested restricted stock unit awards for the year ended December31, 2013 is as follows: Numberof Shares Weighted Average GrantDate FairValue Outstanding - January 1 534,157 $ 85.17 Granted 143,288 100.13 Vested (107,177 ) 87.16 Forfeited (59,782 ) 88.36 Outstanding - December 31 510,486 $ 89.58 Performance Restricted Stock Units In the first quarter of each of 2013 and 2012, the company granted performance restricted stock units to certain officers. These units have requisite service periods of three years and have no dividend rights. Compensation expense related to performance restricted stock units was $6.6 million and II-52 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) $2.6 million for the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. At December31, 2013, there were $8.0 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance restricted stock units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The actual payout of these units varies based on the companys performance over the three-year period based on pre-established targets over the period and a market condition modifier based on total shareholder return (TSR) compared to an industry peer group. The actual payout under these awards may exceed an officers target payout; however, compensation cost initially recognized assumes that the target payout level will be achieved and may be adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance- related condition. The fair values of these units are based on the market price of the companys stock on the date of the grant and use a Monte Carlo simulation model for the TSR component. The fair values of the TSR components of the 2013 and 2012 grants were estimated based on the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 0.42% and 0.41%, respectively; dividend yield of 0.81% and 0.85%, respectively; and expected life of 2.88 and 2.83 years, respectively. At December31, 2013 and 2012, there were 182,103 and 95,969 nonvested performance restricted stock units outstanding, respectively.
Other Stock-Based Awards The company grants stock awards to directors. Shares have been generally distributed to a director annually and have a requisite service period of three years. The fair value of these awards is charged to compensation expense over the directors terms. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these awards until the awarded stock vests and for certain awards until an additional two-year period lapses. There are voting and dividend rights associated with these awards. Compensation expense related to these stock awards was $0.8 million, $0.9 million and $1.0million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013, there were $0.3million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested other stock-based awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately one year. At December31, 2013 and 2012, nonvested other stock-based awards of 16,112 and 23,107 shares, respectively, were outstanding.
Management Stock Purchase Program The company maintains a management stock purchase program under the Plan (together with a predecessor stock purchase plan, the MSPP). Under the MSPP, employees at a specified level may purchase, with their eligible annual bonus, common stock units at a 30% discount from the lower of the price of the common stock on July1 of the previous year or on the date of purchase, which occurs on the date bonuses are approved by the Board of Directors. Employees make an election on or before June30 of the previous year as to the percentage of their eligible annual bonus that will be used to purchase common stock units under the MSPP. The companys predecessor plan provided for the purchase of shares of the companys common stock. Employees are required to allocate at least 25% of their eligible annual bonuses to purchase common stock units under the MSPP to the extent they have not satisfied certain stock ownership guidelines. MSPP shares or units are restricted from sale or transfer for four years from the purchase date. Only shares or units corresponding to the 30% discount are forfeited if the employees employment terminates prior to the end of the four-year vesting period. Dividends or dividend-equivalents are paid on MSPP shares or units, and the participant has the right to vote all MSPP shares.

12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans The company has both tax-qualified and nonqualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that together cover certain domestic and foreign employees. These plans provide benefits based upon a participants II-54 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) compensation and years of service. The nonqualified plans are made up of the following arrangements: a nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement and a nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement (together, the nonqualified plans). The nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement provides supplemental income to key executives of the company. The benefit is determined by the accumulation of an account balance that results from a percentage of pay credit and interest. No deferrals of pay are required from participants. The balance is paid to a participant after retirement over a 15-year period. The nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement provides benefits to key employees that cannot be provided by the qualified plan due to IRS limitations.
The change in benefit obligation, change in fair value of plan assets and funded status for the plans are as follows: 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Benefit obligation - beginning $ 485.0 $ 421.9 Service cost 30.4 28.4 Interest cost 18.3 19.5 Actuarial (gain) loss (20.8 ) 37.2 Benefits paid (39.5 ) (23.1 ) Currency/other 3.2 1.1 Benefit obligation - ending $ 476.6 $ 485.0 Fair value of plan assets - beginning $ 355.7 $ 298.7 Actual return on plan assets 64.0 38.2 Company contributions 33.4 40.3 Benefits paid (39.5 ) (23.1 ) Currency/other 2.6 1.6 Fair value of plan assets - ending $ 416.2 $ 355.7 Funded status of the plans, December31 $ (60.4 ) $ (129.3 ) Foreign benefit plan assets at fair value included in the preceding table were $86.2million and $73.3million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The foreign pension plan benefit obligations included in this table were $89.6 million and $75.9 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The benefit obligation for nonqualified plans also included in this table was $66.8million and $69.8million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The nonqualified plans are generally not funded.
At December31, 2013 and 2012, the accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $423.7million and $429.5million, respectively.

II-56 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information for the following years ended December31 are: 2013 2012 2011 Net Cost Discount rate 3.89 % 4.73 % 5.15 % Expected return on plan assets 7.27 % 7.52 % 7.93 % Rate of compensation increase 3.38 % 3.76 % 4.34 % Benefit Obligation Discount rate 4.58 % 3.89 % 4.73 % Rate of compensation increase 3.49 % 3.38 % 3.76 % The companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
The long-term rate of return for plan assets is derived from return assumptions determined for each of the significant asset classes. Under this approach, the historical real returns (net of inflation) on different asset classes are combined with long-term expectations for inflation to determine an expected return on assets within that class. These real rates of return for each asset class reflect the long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income investments. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established based on the combination of these asset class real returns and inflation with proper consideration of the effects of diversification and rebalancing.
Plan Assets Plan assets consist of a diversified portfolio of equity securities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents. The company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by exceeding the interest growth in plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. This consideration involves the use of long-term measures that address both return and risk and are not impacted significantly by short-term fluctuations. Equity investments include a diversified mix of growth, value and small and large capitalization securities. Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
The weighted average target asset allocations for the plans at December31, are as follows: TargetAllocation 2013 2012 Asset Categories Equity securities 61 % 61 % Fixed income securities 33 % 33 % Cash equivalents 6 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % Due to short-term fluctuations in asset performance, allocation percentages may temporarily deviate from these target allocation percentages before a rebalancing occurs. Cash equivalents are used to satisfy benefit disbursement requirements and will vary throughout the year.

(B) There were no plan assets categorized as Level 3 at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Plan assets categorized as Level 2 primarily consist of commingled funds invested in cash equivalents, equities and fixed income securities. These assets are valued using other inputs, such as net asset values provided by the fund administrators or by dealer quotes for similarly-rated instruments that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the remaining term of the plan instruments.
Funding Policy and Expected Contributions The companys objective in funding its domestic tax-qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also consider the relationship between the returns on each asset compared to the plans corresponding expense and consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plans benefit obligation and its corresponding funded status. The company expects to make discretionary contributions of up to $30million to its qualified plans in 2014.
The total expected benefit payments are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2014 $ 31.8 2015 31.7 2016 32.8 2017 34.8 2018 36.6 2019 through 2023 201.6 II-58 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Defined Contribution Retirement Plans All domestic employees of the company not covered by a collective bargaining agreement who have been scheduled for 1,000 hours of service are eligible to participate in the companys defined contribution plan. The amounts charged to income for this plan were $12.8 million, $9.8million and $7.9 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Outside the United States, the company maintains defined contribution plans along with small pension arrangements that are typically funded with insurance products. These arrangements had a total expense of $4.2million, $2.6 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, the company maintains a long-term deferred compensation arrangement for directors that allows deferral of the annual retainer and meeting fees at the directors election. The company annually accrues for long-term compensation, which is paid out upon the directors retirement from the board. The total 2013 expense for these arrangements was not material.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plan The company does not provide subsidized postretirement healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage except for a limited number of former employees. As this plan is unfunded, contributions are made as benefits are incurred. The benefit obligation for this plan was $7.9 million and $8.9 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss were $2.4 million ($1.5 million after tax) for the year ended December31, 2013 and $3.2 million ($2.0 million after tax) for the year ended December31, 2012. The net periodic benefit cost was $0.5 million for the year ended December31, 2013 and $0.6 million for each of the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011.

The companys management, with the participation of the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2013. Based upon that evaluation, the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December31, 2013, the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.
