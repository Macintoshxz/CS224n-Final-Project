Business General C. R. Bard, Inc. (the company or Bard) is engaged in the design, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. Charles Russell Bard founded the company in 1907. In 1923, the company was incorporated as C. R. Bard, Inc. and distributed an assortment of urological and surgical products. Bard became a publicly traded company in 1963 and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange five years later. The company sells a broad range of products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities. In general, Bards products are intended to be used once and then discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company holds market leading positions in vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products. Bards product strategy is based on the following tenets, which are designed to position the company for continued growth:  Clinician Preference - Bard targets markets where clinicians drive purchasing decisions based on the benefit a product provides to patients.
Product Leadership - The company pursues opportunities in markets where products that consistently provide superior clinical and patient value can attain a leadership position.
Market Growth - Bard focuses its investments in fast growing and/or under-served markets.
Competitive Advantage - The company strives to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through product quality and innovation, intellectual property protection and a core competency in managing complex clinical and regulatory requirements.
Product Diversity - Bard offers a broad, diverse product portfolio to balance the risks inherent in the highly competitive and complex medical device industry.
Bards execution of this strategy has helped the company establish market leadership positions across its four product group categories. In 2007, approximately 80% of the companys net sales were derived from product lines in which the company holds a number one or number two market share position.
Product Group Information The company reports its sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products. The following table sets forth for the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 the approximate percentage contribution by category to Bards consolidated net sales on a worldwide basis.
FortheYearsEndedDecember31, 2007 2006 2005 Vascular 24 % 24 % 25 % Urology 30 % 30 % 29 % Oncology 25 % 24 % 23 % Surgical Specialties 17 % 18 % 19 % Other 4 % 4 % 4 % Total net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % I-1 Table of Contents Vascular Products Bard develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of products for the peripheral vascular market. Bards line of minimally invasive vascular products includes percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheters, guidewires, introducers and accessories, peripheral stents, stent grafts, vena cava filters and biopsy devices; electrophysiology products, including electrophysiology laboratory systems and diagnostic, therapeutic and temporary pacing electrode catheters; and fabrics, meshes and implantable vascular grafts. The combination of a low-profile catheter and high pressure balloon have made Bards Conquest  and Atlas  PTA catheters popular choices of clinicians for the treatment of arterial venous access stenosis and peripheral artery disease. Utilizing the same balloon technology, in the third quarter of 2007 the company launched its new Dorado  catheter, which addresses the largest segment of the PTA catheter market. The company has Pre-Market Approval (PMA) applications pending with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for vascular stenting indications for its Flair  AV (arterial venous) Access Stent Graft and its E  Luminexx  Iliac Stent. Bards G2  vena cava filter is indicated for permanent implant or removal after the threat of blood clots traveling from the lower extremities to a patients lungs has passed. Bards Vacora  device combines the benefits of a vacuum-assisted biopsy sample with a portable, self-contained needle system for the diagnosis of breast tumors. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company began a controlled rollout of its HD (high-density) Mesh Ablation Catheter in Europe for the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation, the most commonly diagnosed sustained cardiac arrhythmia. In 2008, the company plans to begin enrollment in a clinical trial for the approval of the device in the United States.
In January 2008, Bard acquired the LifeStent  family of stents from Edwards Lifesciences Corporation. These stents are currently available in the United States for biliary indications only. A PMA application is currently pending with the FDA for a superficial femoral artery indication for the LifeStent  product.
Urology Products The Foley catheter, which Bard introduced in 1934, remains one of the most important products in the urology field. Foley catheters continue to be marketed in individual sterile packages and in sterile procedural kits and trays, a concept pioneered by Bard. The company has a market leading position in Foley catheters, currently Bards largest selling urology product. This product line includes the infection control Foley catheter (Bardex  I.C. Foley catheter), which has been proven to substantially reduce the rate of urinary tract infections. The company expanded its infection control franchise at the end of 2007 with the launch of the Agento  IC infection control endotracheal tube for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The device uses Bards proprietary silver coating technology to help prevent VAP without the use of antibiotics. Other urology products include surgical slings used to treat stress urinary incontinence; natural and synthetic devices for the treatment of pelvic floor and vaginal prolapse; brachytherapy services, devices and radioactive seeds used to treat prostate cancer; urine monitoring and collection systems; ureteral stents; and specialty devices for ureteroscopic procedures and stone removal.
In 2006, Bard acquired Venetec International, Inc. (Venetec) and its StatLock  line of catheter stabilization products. The proprietary StatLock  stabilization device is used primarily to secure peripheral intravenous catheters, thereby reducing restarts and other complications. This device is also used to secure many other types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies.
Oncology Products Bards oncology products cover a wide range of devices used in the treatment and management of various cancers and other diseases and disorders. These include specialty access catheters, ports, vascular access ultrasound devices and enteral feeding devices. The companys specialty access products, used primarily for chemotherapy, serve a well-established market in which Bard holds a leading position. The features and benefits of the companys broad line of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have allowed Bard to capitalize on the fastest growing segment of the specialty access market. The companys PowerPICC  catheters and PowerPort  devices can also be used to inject contrast media at high flow rates. These devices eliminate the need to place an additional catheter in the significant number of PICC and port recipients who also require CT I-2 Table of Contents (contrast enhanced computed tomography) scans. Bards Site-Rite  vascular access ultrasound device and Sherlock  tip locator system help nurses place a PICC catheter at a patients bedside making PICCs a more convenient and cost-effective treatment option.
Surgical Specialty Products Bards surgical specialty products include patches and fixation systems for hernia and other soft tissue repairs, irrigation devices for orthopaedic, laparoscopic and gynecological procedures and products for topical hemostasis. Soft tissue repair products consist of core hernia repair devices, including both synthetic and natural tissue configurations, and hernia fixation devices. Within the core hernia line, Bards PerFix  plug and Kugel  patch have significantly improved the way inguinal or groin hernias are repaired and have reduced procedure times from hours to minutes. Hernia operations using these types of products can be done in an outpatient setting in as little as 20 minutes. The patient generally can return to normal activity after minimal recovery time. The company also markets products for the repair of ventral or abdominal hernias. Products such as the Composix  Kugel  , Ventralex  , Collamend  and Allomax  hernia patches have made Bard a market leader in this segment of the hernia repair market. In December 2007, Bard acquired a license to manufacture and market Genzyme Corporations Sepramesh  IP hernia repair patch. The Sepra  bioresorbable adhesion barrier complements Bards ePTFE barrier products to give the company a broader presence in the ventral hernia repair market. The license includes the rights to use the Sepra  coating technology in the development of future Bard hernia repair products. Bards line of natural tissue hernia products, including the Collamend  and Allomax  patches are used to repair complex ventral hernias. In complex hernias, pre-existing infections or high risk of infection precludes the use of synthetic mesh for the repair.
To expand its offerings around the hernia repair call point, in 2004 the company acquired the Salute  Fixation system and related technology from Onux Medical, Inc. Bard currently sells a disposable version called Salute II that utilizes a permanent fixation construct to attach a patch to host tissue in laparoscopic hernia repair procedures. The company further enhanced its product offerings in this space in 2007 by acquiring the Permasorb  fixation device which utilizes a bioresorbable tack to attach a patch to the tissue.
International Bard markets its products through subsidiaries and joint ventures in over 100 countries outside the United States. The products sold in the companys international markets include many of the products described above. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the companys international businesses vary with market size and stage of development. The companys principal international markets are in Europe and Japan. The company maintains a geographically-based sales organization that it believes gives it greater flexibility in international markets. Approximately 70% of international sales are of products manufactured by Bard in the United States, Puerto Rico or Mexico. For financial reporting purposes, revenues, income from continuing operations before tax provision and long-lived assets in significant geographic areas are presented in Note 14 Segment Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Bards foreign operations are subject to certain financial and other risks, and international operations in general present complex tax and cash management issues requiring sophisticated analysis to meet the companys financial objectives. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country. Trade receivable balances outside the United States generally are outstanding for longer periods than in the United States. Inventory management is also an important business concern due to the potential for rapidly changing business conditions and currency exposure. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect income and cash flows of international operations. The company attempts to hedge some of these currency exposures to reduce the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on the business. For more information, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Note 9 Derivative Instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements and Risk Factors included in this Form 10-K.
I-3 Table of Contents Competition The company competes in the therapeutic and diagnostic medical device markets around the world. These global markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. The companys market position depends on its reliable product quality, dependable service and ability to develop products to meet evolving market needs. The company faces a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to smaller manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products, and to a limited extent, reprocessors of single-use medical devices. Many of Bards products are patented or are the subject of patent applications. Patent protection also affects the companys market position.
In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the trend among hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers is to consolidate purchases to enhance purchasing power. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, sales transactions are more complex and tend to involve more significant contracts than in the past. This enhanced purchasing power has placed pressure on product pricing. For more information, see Risk Factors.
Marketing The companys products are distributed domestically directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions as well as through numerous hospital/surgical supply and other medical specialty distributors with whom the company has distribution agreements. In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country. Full-time representatives of the company in domestic and international markets carry on sales promotion. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end users, accounted for approximately 33% of the companys net sales in each of the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, and the five largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 67%, 70% and 69%, respectively, of such sales for the corresponding years. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the companys consolidated net sales in 2007 and in 2005. The largest distributor, Owens & Minor, Inc., accounted for approximately 10% of the companys net sales in 2006.
In order to service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels, the company operates a consolidated distribution facility in the United States and a consolidated distribution facility in Europe. Orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt. Backlog is not considered a significant issue for the company.
Most of the products sold by the company, whether manufactured by the company or by others, are sold under the BARD  trade name or trademark and/or other trademarks owned by the company. Products manufactured for the company by outside suppliers are generally produced according to the companys specifications.
Available Information The company makes available, free of charge on its website located at www.crbard.com , its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
The company has adopted, and has posted on its website at www.crbard.com , a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to the companys chief executive officer, chief financial officer and controller. To the extent required, the company intends to disclose any amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Ethics on the website set forth above. In addition, the companys audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, governance committee charter, corporate governance guidelines and business ethics policy are also posted on the companys website at www.crbard.com . A copy of any of these documents is also available, free of charge, upon written request sent to C. R. Bard, Inc., 730 Central Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974, Attention: I-4 Table of Contents Secretary. Shareholders or other interested parties may communicate directly with the Board of Directors, the non-management members of the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The process for doing so is described on the companys website at www.crbard.com .
Regulation The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the companys products are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States. Government regulation, including detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, record keeping and storage and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions. For more information, see Risk Factors.
In October 2002, the Medical Device User Fees Modernization Act (MDUFMA) was enacted in response to the FDAs request for additional funds to be allocated for staffing needs so that statutory deadlines for review times could be met. Through MDUFMA, those funds are generated through the application of user fees for device submissions. The continuation of the user fee process by the FDA is tied to submission review time performance goals. As a result of MDUFMA, the company is obligated to pay user fees at the time of product approval submissions. The cost of those fees is not material to the companys results of operations.
While FDA review times have improved since passage of the MDUFMA and there is anticipation that performance goals will be met, there can be no assurance that the FDA review process will not involve delays or that clearances will be granted on a timely basis.
Medical device laws are also in effect in many of the countries in which the company does business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of the companys medical device products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events are also components of most of these regulatory systems. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. For more information, see Risk Factors.
In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) regulates medical devices through the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL) which was reformed effective April 1, 2005. Implementation and enforcement of the reforms are evolving, and compliance guidance from the MHLW is still in development. The revisions to Japans regulations have resulted in longer lead times for product approvals.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Healthcare Cost Containment Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures. Difficulty in obtaining coverage, coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can linger for months or even years. For more information, see Risk Factors.
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it can affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Manufacturers such as Bard rely on insurance reimbursement to create favorable markets for their products, I-5 Table of Contents while providers depend on this reimbursement to incorporate new products into their medical practices. As the largest single insurer in the United States, Medicare has a profound influence on the healthcare market. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) formulates national and local coverage policy and sets payment rates for facilities and physician providers. Additionally, most private payors will follow the lead of CMS when developing their policies and payment rates. Technology assessment organizations, including the one run by Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, are consulted by public and private payors to evaluate the relative merits of new technologies and their impact on net health outcomes in an effort to get as much value for the healthcare dollar as possible.
The processes necessary for a manufacturer to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement are complex and usually vary from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursements to hospitals and ambulatory care facilities are typically made for procedures or episodes of care, which include the costs of devices, supplies and equipment, and provide an incentive for efficient care and careful use of more expensive technologies.
Third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on health care and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes. In addition, in an effort to better align incentives for providers, CMS and several large commercial payors have recently adopted policies that will cease to pay for certain preventable, hospital-acquired infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections and VAP. We believe our products (such as Bardex  IC and Agento  IC  ) are well-positioned to help provide the benefits sought by these strategies, although the uncertainty and complexity of future legislation and payor requirements make it difficult to ultimately predict the impact of these factors on our business.
Raw Materials The company uses a wide variety of readily available plastics, textiles, alloys and latex materials for conversion into its devices. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers. Certain of the raw materials are available only from single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, sole-source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Bard works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. For more information, see Risk Factors.
Environment The company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United States. The operations of the company, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While the company continues to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on the companys competitive position, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. For more information, see Legal Proceedings.
Employees The company had approximately 10,200 employees as of December 31, 2007.
Seasonality The companys business is not affected to any material extent by seasonal factors.
Research and Development The company is engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of its existing products and to I-6 Table of Contents expand the applications for which the uses of its products are appropriate. The company is dedicated to developing and acquiring novel technologies that will furnish healthcare providers with a more complete line of products to treat medical conditions through less invasive procedures and in a cost-effective manner. The companys research and development expenditures from continuing operations were $135.8 million in 2007, $144.9 million in 2006, and $113.7 million in 2005. The company continually evaluates developing technologies in areas where it may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition.
Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to Bards business. The company also relies upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve its competitive position. The company reviews third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
The company owns an extensive portfolio of patents and has numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in certain foreign countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of the companys products. The companys policy is to file patent applications in the United States and foreign countries where rights are available and where the company believes it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. The company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. For more information, see Risk Factors.
Item 1A. Risk Factors An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in evaluating our business. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity, and/or results of operations.
Defects or failures associated with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts, negative publicity regarding the company and litigation, including product liability claims, that could adversely affect our business and reputation and result in loss of customers.
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types we produce entail inherent risks. Our products are often used in clinically demanding circumstances with seriously ill patients, and many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. There are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition, injury or death of a patient with respect to products that we manufacture or sell, including component failures, manufacturing flaws, unanticipated or improper uses of our products, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information.
These problems could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products and could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal of these products from the body and claims against us for costs associated with the removal. Any recall, whether voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries, could result in significant costs and significant negative publicity. Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals and/or harm our I-7 Table of Contents ability to market our products in the future. The foregoing problems could also result in product liability claims being brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class, and while we believe that many settlements and judgments may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies, there is no guarantee that these amounts will be adequate to cover damages and/or costs or that insurers wont contest coverage. See Legal Proceedings below for a description of lawsuits filed or asserted against the company including with respect to its Composix  Kugel  products. Moreover, in some circumstances adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the FDA suspending or delaying its review of our applications for new product approvals. Any of the foregoing problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
We face intense competition from other companies, and our inability to continue to effectively develop, acquire and/or market new products and technologies could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The medical device business is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change. Our customers consider many factors when choosing among products, including product features and reliability, clinical outcomes, product availability, price and product services provided by the manufacturer. Product introductions, or enhancements by competitors that provide better features and/or lower pricing, may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive.
As a result, we engage in product development and improvement programs to maintain and improve our competitive position. We may not, however, be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new products or technologies that will achieve regulatory approval or receive market acceptance. As part of our competitive strategy, we also pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and products to facilitate our future business strategies. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once a business is acquired, any inability to successfully integrate the business, failure to retain and develop its workforce or failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. If we fail to develop new products, enhance existing products or identify and acquire complementary businesses, technologies and products, or otherwise compete effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Domestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms in the United States and in significant overseas markets such as Germany, Japan, France and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products. Even when we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.
Major third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny I-8 Table of Contents of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers resterilize our products intended for a single use or purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us.
Further legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for these procedures, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement issues, would have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices which our customers are willing to pay for them. These outcomes, along with cost containment measures, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business.
We manufacture our products at facilities located throughout the world, some of which are in areas that are prone to hurricanes and other natural disasters. In some cases, certain of our key products are manufactured at one facility. If an event occurred that resulted in damage to one or more of our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, we purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. As a result, a reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We are subject to a comprehensive system of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and we could be the subject of an enforcement action or face lawsuits and monetary or equitable judgments.
Our operations are affected by various state, federal and international healthcare, environmental, antitrust, anti-corruption and employment laws, including for example various FDA and international regulations and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). We are subject to periodic inspections to determine compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation requirements, current medical device adverse event reporting regulations and foreign rules and regulations. Product approvals by the FDA and other foreign regulators can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. The failure to comply with regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in FDA Form-483 notices and/or warning letters, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, detainment, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the healthcare industry is under scrutiny from state governments and the federal government with respect to industry practices in the area of sales and marketing. If our marketing or sales activities fail to comply with the FDAs regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings from the FDA or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies. In the recent past, medical device manufacturers have been the subject of investigations from state and federal prosecutors related to their relationships with doctors, among other activities or practices. See Legal Proceedings below for a description of a subpoena received by the companys Urological Division relating to the Divisions brachytherapy business. If an enforcement action involving the company were to occur, it could result in penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
I-9 Table of Contents We operate in many parts of the world and our policies require compliance with the FCPA. Failure to comply with the FCPA could subject the company to civil or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
In addition, lawsuits by employees, customers, licensors, licensees, suppliers, business partners, distributors, shareholders or competitors with respect to how we conduct our business could be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve these disputes on terms favorable to us. The occurrence of an adverse monetary or equitable judgment or a large expenditure in connection with a settlement of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations. For more information, see Legal Proceedings.
We are substantially dependent on patent and proprietary rights and could incur significant costs defending and protecting those rights or face restrictions or additional costs in connection with the sale of our products.
We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards (treble damages under certain circumstances) and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant damage awards, settlement payments or royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business, we believe that an adverse outcome associated with any pending litigation could generally have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in a future period.
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. Although these patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements may not successfully protect our intellectual property, we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property. Our pending patent applications may not result in patents issuing to us, and patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and these patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, we operate in foreign markets where protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weaker than in the United States, and inadequate patent protection in those markets may adversely affect our competitive position. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and we cannot assure you that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all. For more information, see Legal Proceedings.
Our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material impact on our business or results of operations.
Sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 31 percent of our net sales in 2007. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the United States. As a result, our sales and profitability from our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country including those related to political and economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
I-10 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties The executive offices of the company are located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, in a facility that the company owns. Domestic manufacturing and development units are located in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Utah. Sales offices are in many of these locations as well as others. Outside the United States, the company has plants or offices in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.
The company owns approximately 2.3 million square feet of space in 16 locations and leases approximately 1.2 million square feet of space in 48 locations. All of these facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If a third partys patent infringement claim were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company were to be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of the patent on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and similar state laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for any remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined.
The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and results of operations for a future period.
On November 27, 2006, the companys Urological Division received a subpoena issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes. The subpoena seeks documents related to the Divisions brachytherapy business. The company is cooperating with the governments request and is in the process of responding to the subpoena. At this stage of the inquiry, the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be assessed. The company cannot give any I-11 Table of Contents assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period.
As of February 25, 2008, approximately 580 federal and 280 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,135 plaintiffs, as well as nine putative class actions, have been filed or asserted against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  product intended for ventral hernia repair (collectively, the Composix Claims). The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the product beginning in December 2005. The actions generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the product and theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, also seek (i) medical monitoring, (ii) compensatory damages, (iii) punitive damages, (iv) a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v) attorneys fees. On June22, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred Composix lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Approximately 245 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 1,465 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions.
The Composix Claims are at a preliminary stage. In the vast majority of these cases, we have not yet obtained and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, we are unable to fully evaluate the claims or determine the time frame in which they may be resolved. As in most litigation of this nature, the Composix Claims present a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. We believe that many settlements and judgments relating to the Composix Claims may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Composix Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the Composix Claims will not have a material adverse impact on the companys result of operations in future periods or the companys financial position or liquidity. For more information, see Risk Factors.
On February 21, 2007, Southeast Missouri Hospital filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against the company and another manufacturer under the caption Southeast Missouri Hospital, et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al . (Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern District). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendant conspired to exclude competitors from the market and to maintain the companys market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages. Antitrust damages are subject to trebling. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. At this time, it is not possible to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court is currently assessing Gores assertion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Because the company considers this matter a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded as of December31, 2007.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The company designs, manufacturers, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad, diversified portfolio of products to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care health facilities and alternate site facilities in the United States and abroad, principally in Europe and Japan. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or implanted either temporarily or permanently. The company reports sales in four major product group categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group of other products.
The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketing innovative and differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2007, the company spent $135.8million on research and development (R&D), including purchased R&D. The company expects R&D spending, net of purchased R&D, to continue to increase in the future. The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small to medium sized transactions that provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may from time to time consider acquisitions of larger, established companies under appropriate circumstances. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $83.6million in 2007 for the acquisition and license of products and technologies. For a discussion of significant acquisitions that the company completed during 2007, 2006 and 2005, see the information in Note2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Results of Continuing Operations Net Sales The companys revenues are generated from sales of the companys products, net of discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. Bard reported 2007 consolidated net sales of $2,202.0 million, an increase of 11% on a reported basis over 2006 consolidated net sales of $1,979.6 million. Bard reported 2006 consolidated net sales of $1,979.6 million, an increase of 12% on a reported basis over 2005 consolidated net sales of $1,768.4 million.
Bards 2007 net sales increased 9% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Bards 2006 net sales increased 12% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. The acquisition of the StatLock  stabilization device product line in the second quarter of 2006 increased the net sales growth for 2006 by approximately 2 percentage points. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below.
The table below presents the geographic breakdown of net sales by the location of the third-party customer for each of the last three years: 2007 2006 2005 United States 69 % 70 % 69 % Europe 19 % 18 % 19 % Japan 5 % 5 % 5 % Rest of world 7 % 7 % 7 % Total net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % II-3 Table of Contents The growth in consolidated net sales included an increase of 0.1% and a decrease of 0.1% as a result of price changes for 2007 and 2006, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations also impacted consolidated net sales, increasing 2007 consolidated net sales by 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations did not impact the growth in consolidated net sales in 2006 compared to the prior year. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.
Bards 2007 United States net sales of $1,520.6 million increased 10% over 2006 United States net sales of $1,383.0 million. Bards 2007 international net sales of $681.4 million increased 14% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis over 2006 international net sales of $596.6 million. Bards 2006 United States net sales of $1,383.0 million increased 13% over 2005 United States net sales of $1,221.0 million. Bards 2006 international net sales of $596.6 million increased 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis over 2005 international net sales of $547.4 million.

On December 29, 2005, the company initiated a voluntary Class I product recall of its Bard  Composix  Kugel  Mesh X-Large Patch intended for ventral hernia repair. The companys sales results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 included a net sales reduction of $7.8 million in the surgical specialty group due to this recall, resulting in a 1 percentage point reduction in 2005 consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis. Following the recall, the FDA conducted an inspection and issued a Form-483 notice to the companys Davol, Inc. subsidiary identifying certain observations. The company has addressed these observations.
On March 15, 2006, the company voluntarily expanded the December 29, 2005 recall to include certain manufacturing lots of the large Composix  Kugel  patch and large Composix  circle. In December 2006, the company decided to voluntarily expand the March recall to include additional manufacturing lots and initiated the expanded recall on January 10, 2007. The impact of these subsequent recalls was not material to the companys full year 2006 financial results.
Following the expanded recall, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection and issued a Form-483 notice to Davol identifying certain observations regarding Davols quality systems. The company has responded and is in the process of addressing these observations. On April 25, 2007, Davol received a Warning Letter from the New England District Office of the FDA resulting from the follow-up inspection. The Warning Letter relates specifically to non-conformances in Davols quality systems previously identified in the related Form-483. The II-6 Table of Contents Warning Letter states that, until Davol resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, no premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related will be cleared or approved. Davol presently has no such submissions before the FDA. The company has responded to all observations in the Warning Letter and intends to fully implement corrective actions to address the FDAs concerns. The company has met with FDA representatives to advise them of the progress being made in addressing observations in the Warning Letter and has proposed a re-inspection of the Davol facility in the first half of 2008. The company cannot, however, give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Warning Letter or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Warning Letter. For more information, see Risk Factors.

See Note 3 Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The change in the companys effective tax rate between 2007 and 2006 is primarily related to the impact of the reduction of the income tax provision in 2006 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years as well as changes in the mix of income among tax jurisdictions.
The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, investments in businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be the companys primary source of funds. Should it be necessary, the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms. The company believes that its overall financial strength gives the company sufficient financing flexibility.

Total debt to total capitalization was 7.5%, 8.1% and 16.4% at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, the company spent $422.8 million to purchase 5,115,138 shares of the companys common stock. In 2006, the company spent $201.3 million to purchase 2,787,600 shares of the companys common stock. In 2005, the company spent $143.4 million to purchase 2,200,000 shares of companys common stock. On October 10, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the companys common stock. The company paid cash dividends of $60.1 million, $56.3 million and $52.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The company had no short-term borrowings in 2007. In 2006, the average outstanding balance of short-term borrowings was approximately $82.0million with an effective interest rate of 5.33%. At December31, 2006, all short-term borrowings had been repaid.
On June 28, 2007, the company amended its existing domestic syndicated bank credit facility with a $400 million five-year credit agreement that expires in June 2012. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. There were no outstanding borrowings or commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In addition, on October 21, 2005, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the company entered into a $250 million syndicated bank credit facility to be used for general corporate needs, including in support of the companys decision in 2005 to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings under the AJCA. Loans under the facility bear interest at the companys option at a fixed spread to LIBOR or the higher of prime rate and 0.50% over the federal funds rate. The facility expires in October 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.
II-12 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had outstanding approximately $149.8 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2026 and pay a semi-annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The market value of the notes approximated $158.3 million at December 31, 2007.
Certain of the companys debt agreements contain customary representations, warranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of operating cash flow levels and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants.
At December 31, 2007, the companys long-term debt was rated A by Standard and Poors and Baa1 by Moodys, and the companys commercial paper ratings were A-1 by Standard and Poors and P-2 by Moodys.
Commitments and Contingencies Presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December31, 2007.
Contractual Obligations (dollars in millions) Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5+ Years Forward contracts $ 126.5 $ 126.5 $  $  $  Total debt 150.6 0.8   149.8 Capital lease obligations 0.1 0.1    Operating lease obligations 123.6 21.1 32.7 22.1 47.7 Acquisition and investment milestones 24.0 6.0 18.0   Purchase obligations 176.6 136.8 25.5 11.6 2.7 Other long-term liabilities 108.8  26.2 20.8 61.8 $ 710.2 $ 291.3 $ 102.4 $ 54.5 $ 262.0 The table above does not include $55.3 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $11.7 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of previously unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $20.0 million within twelve months of December 31, 2007 based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations and/or the conclusion of tax examinations in several jurisdictions.
Forward contracts - The company periodically enters into forward contracts and purchases options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements. The table above includes forward currency agreements, which obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.
Total debt - Total debt was $150.6 million at December 31, 2007, consistent with debt balances at December 31, 2006. Total debt was $150.6 million at December 31, 2006, down $150.8 million from December31, 2005. Total debt to capitalization was 7.5% at December 31, 2007. Total debt to total capitalization was 8.1% at December 31, 2006.
Operating lease obligations - The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.
II-13 Table of Contents Acquisition and investment milestones - The company enters into various acquisition and investment arrangements, including research and development arrangements, product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations. In connection with some of these activities, the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets. Such payments, when made, are allocated to specific intangible asset categories, assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development, depending on the nature of the arrangement.
Purchase obligations - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business.
Other long-term liabilities - Other long-term liabilities include tax, pension liabilities, product liabilities, and other long-term liabilities of approximately $175.8 million.
Pension Obligations - The companys objective in funding its domestic tax-qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also take into account each tax-qualified plans return compared to the plans corresponding expense and the extent to which each tax-qualified plans benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status. In 2007, the company made voluntary contributions of $15.0 million to the companys U.S. tax-qualified plan and $6.8 million to the companys non-U.S. tax-qualified plans. In 2006, the company made voluntary contributions of $12.0 million to the companys U.S. tax-qualified plan and $2.6 million to the companys non-U.S. tax-qualified plans. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2008 pension funding. The nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans include supplemental plans which are generally not funded.
Legal Matters - On November 27, 2006, the companys Urological Division received a subpoena issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes. The subpoena seeks documents related to the divisions brachytherapy business. The company is cooperating with the governments request and is in the process of responding to the subpoena. At this stage of the inquiry the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be assessed. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period.
As of February 25, 2008, approximately 580 federal and 280 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,135 plaintiffs, as well as nine putative class actions, have been filed or asserted against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  product intended for ventral hernia repair (collectively, the Composix Claims). The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the product beginning in December 2005. The actions generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the product and theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, also seek (i) medical monitoring, (ii) compensatory damages, (iii) punitive damages, (iv) a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v) attorneys fees. On June22, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred Composix lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Approximately 245 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 1,465 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions.
The Composix Claims are at a preliminary stage. In the vast majority of these cases, we have not yet obtained and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, we are unable to fully evaluate the claims or determine the time frame in which they may be resolved. As in most litigation of this nature, the Composix Claims present a wide variety of claims, ranging II-14 Table of Contents from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. We believe that many settlements and judgments relating to the Composix claims may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Composix Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the Composix Claims will not have a material adverse impact on the companys result of operations in future periods or the companys financial position or liquidity. For more information, see Risk Factors.
On February 21, 2007, Southeast Missouri Hospital filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against the company and another manufacturer under the caption Southeast Missouri Hospital, et al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al . (Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern District). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendant conspired to exclude competitors from the market and to maintain the companys market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages. Antitrust damages are subject to trebling. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. At this time, it is not possible to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court is currently assessing Gores assertion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Because the company considers this matter a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded as of December 31, 2007.
New Accounting Pronouncements - In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective as of the beginning of Bards 2008 fiscal year, with the exception of certain provisions deferred until fiscal 2009. The impact of this standard on the companys consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material in 2008.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. FAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of Bards 2008 fiscal year. The company did not elect the fair value option permitted by FAS 159 upon adoption.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (FAS 160). FAS141R requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. FAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. FAS 141R and FAS 160 are effective as of the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FAS 141R and FAS160.
II-15 Table of Contents Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for GAAP results.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result.
Revenue recognition - The company recognizes product revenue, net of discounts and rebates, when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss has transferred, the buyers price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Unless agreed otherwise, the companys terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss pass F.O.B. origin. Certain sales to domestic and European distributors are F.O.B. destination. For arrangements where the companys terms state F.O.B. destination, the company records sales on this basis. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. For most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant.
Share-Based Compensation - The company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with FAS123R. Under the fair value provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources. The expected stock-price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates.
The companys expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility.
II-16 Table of Contents This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations.
With respect to the weighted-average option life assumption, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. FAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.
Legal Accruals - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for costs related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes - The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside the United States. The company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions as well as other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The company regularly assesses its tax position for such matters and includes reserves for those differences in position. The reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired and/or upon the conclusion of the tax examination. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). See Note 3 Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
The company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective tax jurisdiction. Within specific countries, the company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities, or subsidiaries operating within the country may be subject to different statute of limitations expiration dates. As of December 31, 2007, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination in the companys major tax jurisdictions are: United States  federal 2003andforward United States  states 2002 and forward Germany 2001 and forward Malaysia 2001 and forward Puerto Rico 2003 and forward United Kingdom 2005 and forward Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns - Management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation II-17 Table of Contents at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.
It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change.
Valuation of Purchased R&D, Goodwill and Intangible Assets - When the company acquires another company, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between purchased R&D, other identifiable intangible assets, tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Purchased R&D is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased R&D and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased R&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For purchased R&D, these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including purchased R&D, of the acquired businesses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists. The test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The companys estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the companys consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows.
Intangible assets consist primarily of patents, distribution agreements, and other intellectual property, which are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 8 to 24 years. The company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable.
Pension Plans - The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company, within certain guidelines. In addition, the companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. These differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company.
II-18 Table of Contents Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.
In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often utilized on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, Warning Letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above and those under the heading Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to: Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;  the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products;  the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfully integrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions with favorable terms;  the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternate therapies;  the ability to maintain or increase research and development expenditures;  the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;  the ability to maintain our effective tax rate and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;  the risk that the company may not successfully implement its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information system , which could adversely affect the companys results of operations in future periods or its ability to meet the ongoing requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; II-19 Table of Contents  internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others;  changes in factors and assumptions employed in the application of FAS 123R, or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns, which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period and, as a result, materially impact the companys results of operations;  damage to a company facility, which could render the company unable to manufacture one or more products (as the company may utilize only one manufacturing facility for certain of its major products) and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assets specifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets; and  the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms.
Competitive factors, including:  the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry as well as among our customers, resulting in potentially greater pricing pressures and more significant and complex contracts than in the past, both in the United States and abroad;  development of new products or technologies by competitors having superior performance compared to our current products or products under development which could negatively impact sales of our products or render one or more of our products obsolete;  technological advances, patents and registrations obtained by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments or preventing the company from selling a product or including key features in the companys products;  attempts by competitors to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; and  reprocessing by third-party reprocessors of our products designed and labeled for single use.
Difficulties and delays inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products, including:  the ability to complete planned clinical trials successfully, to develop and obtain regulatory approval for products on a timely basis and to launch products on a timely basis within cost estimates;  lengthy and costly regulatory approval processes, which may result in lost market opportunities;  delays or denials of, or grants of low or reduced levels of reimbursement for, procedures using newly developed products;  the suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture, market or distribute existing products;  the imposition of additional or different regulatory requirements, such as those affecting manufacturing and labeling;  performance, efficacy or safety concerns for existing products, whether scientifically justified or not, that may lead to product withdrawals, recalls, field corrections, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation or declining sales, including adverse events relating to the companys vena cava filters and hernia repair products; II-20 Table of Contents  FDA inspections resulting in FDA Form-483 observations and/or Warning Letters identifying deficiencies in the companys current good manufacturing practices and/or quality systems; Warning Letters which identify violations of FDA regulations that could result in product holds, recalls, restrictions on future clearances by the FDA for products to which the deficiencies are reasonably related and/or civil penalties;  the failure to obtain, limitations on the use of, or the loss of, patent and other intellectual property rights, and the failure of efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement and legal challenges that can increase our costs;  difficulties obtaining necessary components or raw materials used in the companys products and/or price increases from the companys suppliers of critical components or raw materials or other interruptions of the supply chain; and  customers that may limit the number of manufacturers or vendors from which they will purchase products, which can result in the companys inability to sell products to or contract with large hospital systems, integrated delivery networks or group purchasing organizations.
Governmental action, including:  the impact of continued healthcare cost containment;  new laws and judicial decisions related to health care availability, payment for healthcare products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to the United States Medicare and Medicaid systems or other United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce or eliminate reimbursements for procedures that use the companys products;  changes in the FDA and/or foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity;  the impact of more vigorous compliance and enforcement activities affecting the healthcare industry in general or the company in particular;  changes in the tax or environmental laws or standards affecting our business;  changes in the law that could require facility upgrades or process changes and could affect production rates and output; and  compliance costs and potential penalties and remediation obligations in connection with environmental laws, including regulations regarding air emissions, waste water discharges and solid waste.
Legal disputes, including:  disputes over intellectual property rights;  product liability claims including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including with respect to our Composix Kugel products;  claims asserting securities law violations;  claims asserting, and/or subpoenas seeking information regarding, violations of law in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid;  derivative shareholder actions;  claims and subpoenas asserting antitrust violations;  environmental claims, including risks relating to accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in the companys manufacturing, sterilization and research activities and the potential for the company to be held liable for any resulting damages; and II-21 Table of Contents  commercial disputes, including disputes over distribution agreements, license agreements, manufacturing/supply agreements, development/research agreements and acquisition or sale agreements.
General economic conditions, including:  international and domestic business conditions;  political or economic instability in foreign countries;  interest rates;  foreign currency exchange rates; and  changes in the rate of inflation.
Other factors beyond our control, including catastrophes, both natural and man-made, earthquakes, floods, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2007 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $4.6 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $3.8million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.
In December 1996, the company issued $150.0 million of 6.70% notes due 2026. Note holders had a one-time option to redeem the notes at par value on December 1, 2006, and accordingly, the company had classified the notes as current during the 12-month period ending December 1, 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, approximately $0.2 million of the notes were redeemed and the remaining balance of approximately $149.8 million has been reclassified as long-term debt. The market value of the notes approximates $158.3 million at December 31, 2007. Assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity, the market value of the notes would approximate $142.3 million or $176.9million, respectively, on December 31, 2007.
II-22 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.

The company markets its products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities. Bard holds market leading positions in vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products.
Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of most foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November 30. No events occurred related to these foreign subsidiaries during the months of December 2007, 2006 or 2005 that materially affected the financial position or results of operations of the company. In addition, the company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are variable interest entities as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN46R) and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with FIN 46R.
Related Parties - The company has a 50% ownership in Medicon, Inc. (Medicon), a Japanese joint venture with Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. The joint venture was formed in 1972 to distribute Bards products in Japan. Bard accounts for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. All transactions with Medicon are denominated in U.S. dollars. There were no leasing transactions or indebtedness between Medicon and Bard. Bard recorded sales to Medicon of $106.1 million, $98.1 million and $92.1 million for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Included in accounts receivable are trade receivables due from Medicon for purchases of Bards products of $29.0 million and $24.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The company evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 - In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on how to evaluate prior period financial statement misstatements for purposes of assessing their materiality in the current period. There are two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements: the rollover or income statement method and the iron curtain or balance sheet method. Historically, the company used the rollover method. Under this method the company quantified its financial statement misstatements based on the amount of errors originating in the current-year income statement, and as a result did not consider the effects of prior-year misstatements to be material on the companys financial statements. SAB 108 now requires that the company must consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods (dual method) when quantifying misstatements in the financial statements. The II-31 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) iron curtain method quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the misstatements origination. Upon adoption, SAB 108 permits the company to adjust for the cumulative effect of errors that were previously considered immaterial under the rollover method that are now considered material under the dual method. The SAB 108 adjustment affects the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption.
In accordance with SAB 108, the company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 for the items described below.
Excess accounts receivable reserves - The company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 to reflect the reversal of general accounts receivable reserves totaling $9.0 million. These reserves were established in 1998 and prior.
Excess inventory reserves - The company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 to reflect the reversal of general inventory reserves of $17.3 million. These reserves were established in 2001 and prior.
Excess restructuring reserves - The company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for fiscal 2006 to reflect the reversal of a restructuring reserve of $6.4 million. This reserve was established in 1997 according to EITF 94-3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). The company believed at that time that it would be exiting a manufacturing operation. The plan was not completed and accordingly the reserve should have been reversed in 1998.
Impact of adjustments - The impact of each of the items noted above on fiscal 2006 opening retained earnings is presented below.
(dollars in millions) Accounts Receivable Adjustment Inventory Adjustment Restructuring Adjustment Total Adjustment Cumulative effect on retained earnings as of January 1, 2006, (net of $6.2 tax) $ 6.0 $ 14.7 $ 5.8 $ 26.5 Foreign Currency - Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current year-end rates, except that the revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average monthly rates during each monthly period. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and credited or charged directly to a separate component of shareholders investment. Any foreign currency gains or losses related to monetary assets are charged to other (income) expense, net. See Note 13 Other (Income) Expense, Net in these notes to consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) was $82.6million and $38.7million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Revenue Recognition - Bard markets its products worldwide to hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities. The company sells directly to these end-users as well as to independent distributors. Distributor sales accounted for approximately 33% of the companys net sales in 2007.
The companys net sales represent gross sales invoiced to both end-users and independent distributors, less certain related charges, including discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. The company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, title and risk of loss have transferred, the selling price is fixed or determinable, contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured. Unless agreed otherwise, the companys terms with domestic distributors provide that title II-32 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) and risk of loss pass F.O.B. origin. Certain sales to domestic and European distributors are F.O.B. destination. For arrangements where the companys terms state F.O.B. destination, the company records sales on this basis.
In certain circumstances, end-users may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the end-users location. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.
Charges for discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the revenue is recorded. The accrual for product returns, discounts and other allowances is based on the companys history. The company allows customers to return defective or damaged products. Historically, product returns have not been material. The company grants sales rebates to independent distributors based upon the distributors reporting of end-user sales and pricing. Sales rebates are accrued by the company in the period in which the sale is recorded. The companys rebate accrual is based on its history of actual rebates paid. In estimating rebate accruals, the company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor-specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including stated rebate rates. The companys reserves for rebates are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. The company adjusts reserves to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts. Such adjustments impact the amount of net product sales revenue recognized by the company in the period of adjustment.
Shipping and Handling Costs - Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs - Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $3.4million, $3.3 million and $4.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in marketing, selling and administrative expense in the companys consolidated statements of income.
Research and Development - Research and development expenses are comprised of expenses related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities and purchased research and development (purchased R&D) costs arising from the companys business development activities. The components of internal research and development expense include: salary and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services and other costs. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Share-Based Compensation - The company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS123R). Under the fair value provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock- price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources. The expected stock-price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates.
The companys expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to the weighted-average option life assumption, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises.
II-33 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share represents net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share represents net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the incremental dilution of outstanding stock options and awards. Unless indicated otherwise, per share amounts are calculated on a diluted basis. A reconciliation of weighted average common shares outstanding to weighted average common shares outstanding assuming dilution follows for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars and shares in millions except per share amounts) Net income $ 406.4 $ 272.1 $ 337.1 Weighted average common shares outstanding 102.7 103.5 104.8 Incremental common shares issuable: stock options and awards 3.2 3.4 3.2 Weighted average common shares outstanding assuming dilution 105.9 106.9 108.0 Basic earnings per share $ 3.96 $ 2.63 $ 3.22 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.84 $ 2.55 $ 3.12 Treasury Stock - In fiscal 1998, the company began holding repurchased shares of its common stock as treasury stock. The company accounts for these treasury stock purchases as retirements by reducing retained earnings for the cost of the repurchase. Reissuances of these treasury shares are accounted for as new issuances. There were approximately 15.9 million and 13.0 million treasury shares at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Accounts Receivable - In addition to trade receivables, accounts receivable included $6.6million and $6.1million of nontrade receivables due within one year at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost components include material, labor and manufacturing overhead. For most domestic divisions, cost is determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. Approximately 66% of the companys inventory costs are determined using LIFO. For all other inventories cost is determined using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. Due to changing technologies and cost containment, the difference between the valuation under the LIFO method and the FIFO method is not significant. The following is a summary of inventories for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Finished goods $ 143.6 $ 139.5 Work in process 21.9 20.0 Raw materials 79.2 64.8 Total $ 244.7 $ 224.3 II-34 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Consigned inventory was $18.8 million and $14.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Software Capitalization - Internally used software, whether purchased or developed, is capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five to seven years. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment. In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the company capitalizes certain costs associated with internal-use software such as the payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services. Costs associated with internal-use software are expensed during the design phase until the point at which the project has reached the development stage. Subsequent additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The capitalization of software requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which the company expects to benefit from the use of that software. The company capitalized $3.8 million, $4.5 million and $15.7 million of internal-use software for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depreciation expense for capitalized software was approximately $12.0 million, $11.1 million and $8.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - The company reviews long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair market value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets - Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. None of the companys intangible assets have an indefinite life. Intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets have been recorded at either incurred or allocated cost. Allocated costs were based on respective fair market values of identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
The company has generally assigned goodwill recorded in connection with an acquisition to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment, based on the reporting unit which sponsored the acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair market value. See Note 2, Acquisition and Divestitures and Note 13 Other (Income) Expense, Net in these notes to consolidated financial statements.
II-35 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Product Warranty - The majority of the companys products are intended for single use; therefore, the company requires limited product warranty accruals. Certain of the companys products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from sale. The company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The following is a summary of activity in the product warranty accrual: Balance Beginning of Year Chargesto Costs and Expenses Deductions Balance End of Year (dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 $ 2.1 1.8 (2.2 ) $ 1.7 Year Ended December 31, 2006 $ 1.7 2.0 (1.6 ) $ 2.1 Year Ended December 31, 2005 $ 2.1 2.0 (2.4 ) $ 1.7 Environmental Remediation Policy - The company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.
Income Taxes - All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes.
The company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities. These positions relate to, among others, transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions as well as other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The company regularly assesses its tax position for such matters and includes reserves for those differences in position. The reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period.
The companys policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The company does not consider this interest part of its fixed charges.
Income Statement Presentation of Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Government Authorities - The company follows a net basis policy with regard to sales, use, value added or any other tax collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, which excludes them from both net sales and expenses.
Supplemental and Noncash Disclosures of Cash Flow Information - Cash payments for interest totaled $11.8million, $16.3 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $120.6 million, $138.4 million and $93.3 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Noncash acquisition costs related to the purchases of a business totaled $5.3 million and $0.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Dividends declared and not paid equaled $15.1 million, $14.5 million and $13.7 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
II-36 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Concentration Risks - The company is potentially subject to financial instrument concentration of credit risk through its cash investments and trade accounts receivable. To mitigate these risks, the company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments and certain other financial instruments with various major financial institutions. The company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Concentrations of risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, a significant amount of trade receivables is with national healthcare systems in several countries. Although the company does not currently foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables, repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of those countries national economies. Sales to distributors, which supply the companys products to many end users, accounted for approximately 33% of the companys net sales in 2007, and the five largest distributors, including the companys Medicon joint venture, combined, accounted for approximately 67% of such sales. One large distributor accounted for approximately 9% and 10% of the companys net sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively and represented gross receivables of approximately $31.7 million and $31.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Investments - The company accounts for short-term investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The company determines the appropriate classification of all short-term investments as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classifications as of each balance sheet date. There were no investments classified as trading at December 31, 2007 and 2006. All of the outstanding short-term investments at December 31, 2007 and 2006 mature within one year. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders investment.
Derivative Instruments - The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities and anticipated commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The company does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculation purposes. No derivative instruments extend beyond December 2008. The company has formally documented the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives. All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair market value. Hedge accounting is followed for derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair market value and cash flow hedges. For derivatives that have been designated and qualify as fair market value hedges, the changes in the fair market value of highly effective derivatives, along with changes in the fair market value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risks, are recorded in current period earnings. For derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair market value of the effective portion of the derivatives gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2007, all derivative instruments utilized were highly effective hedging instruments because they were denominated in the same currency as the hedged item and because the maturities of the derivative instruments matched the timing of the hedged items. It is the companys policy that when a derivative instrument settles, the associated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reversed to cost of goods sold or other (income) expense, net as appropriate. It is the companys policy that in the event that (1) an anticipated hedged transaction is determined to be not likely to occur or (2) it is determined that a derivative instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the hedged item, the company would reverse the associated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in these notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the companys derivative instruments.
New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157) , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value II-37 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) measurements. FAS 157 is effective as of the beginning of Bards 2008 fiscal year, with the exception of certain positions deferred until 2009. The impact of this standard on the companys consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material in 2008.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. FAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of Bards 2008 fiscal year. The company did not elect the fair value option permitted by FAS 159 upon adoption.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141R) and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, (FAS 160). FAS141R requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. FAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. FAS 141R and FAS 160 are effective as of the beginning of Bards 2009 fiscal year. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FAS 141R and FAS 160.
2. Acquisitions and Divestitures The company spent approximately $83.6 million in 2007, $191.9 million in 2006 and $25.4 million in 2005 for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights and other related items to augment its existing product lines. Unaudited pro forma financial information has not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions and divestitures were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis. Results of operations of these transactions are included in the companys consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition. Several of the companys recent acquisitions and investments involve milestone payments associated with the achievement of certain targets associated with either research and development, regulatory approval or the transfer of manufacturing capabilities. A summary of contingent milestone payments associated with these acquisitions at December31, 2007 isincluded below.
Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After5 Years (dollars in millions) Acquisition and investment milestones $ 24.0 $ 6.0 $ 18.0   II-38 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inrad, Inc.
- On June 13, 2007, the company acquired the assets of Inrad, Inc.s biopsy marker business for $33.8 million including capitalized acquisition costs for legal and other consulting costs. This product line is included in the companys vascular disease state category. In addition, the company has a contingent payment of $0.3 million that will be due upon the delivery of certain equipment. The company considered a variety of factors, including appraisals, comparable transactions, relief from royalty analysis and other discounted cash-flow approaches in determining purchase price allocations. Goodwill associated with this transaction is deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation is as follows: (dollars in millions) Current assets $0.6 Core technology 31.2(Estimatedusefullifeof13yrs) Other intangibles 0.3 (Estimated useful life of 5 yrs) Purchased R&D 1.6 Goodwill 0.1 Total $33.8 The purchased R&D of $1.6 million relates to a biopsy marker device in development at the time of the acquisition. The company recorded the purchased R&D charge in research and development expense in its consolidated statements of income. The value assigned to purchased R&D was determined by identifying a specific purchased R&D project that would be continued and for which (a) technological feasibility had not been established at acquisition date, (b) there was no alternative future use and (c) the fair market value was estimable with reasonable reliability.
Tegress  Withdrawal - In 2004, the company consolidated Genyx Medical Inc. (Genyx), a privately held medical device company, as a variable interest entity under the provisions of FIN 46R. The company subsequently acquired the agreed upon assets of Genyx in 2005 and sold the product under the trade name Tegress TM . The company withdrew from the synthetic bulking market and discontinued sales of the Tegress TM product effective January 31, 2007, and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (FAS 144) has accounted for this withdrawal as a discontinued operation. The withdrawal was based upon a strategic review of the Tegress TM synthetic bulking product, which considered the products limited commercial success to date, significant future clinical costs and uncertain growth potential. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded an impairment charge and related costs associated with Tegress TM of approximately $46.4 million pretax.
Condensed financial information related to the discontinued operation are as follows for the years ended December31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 0.3 $ 5.9 $ 2.9 Pretax income from operations 0.1 (47.0 ) (4.1 ) Income tax provision 0.1 (4.6 ) (0.8 ) Income (loss) on operations $  $ (42.4 ) $ (3.3 ) For the year ended December 31, 2007, Tegress TM net cash flows of $5.3 million related to the collection of customer receivables prior to January 31, 2007 and the wind-down of clinical studies, leases and intellectual property matters. There are no significant environmental or product liabilities associated with the discontinued operation.

On April 7, 2006, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Venetec International, Inc. (Venetec). In connection with the acquisition, the company made payments totaling approximately $166 million, net of cash acquired, including the payment of certain assumed liabilities. Venetec designs, develops, manufactures and markets the StatLock  stabilization device product line. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed: (dollars in millions) Current assets $10.6 Property, plant and equipment 0.8 Goodwill 69.8 Patents 72.5(Estimatedusefullifeof15years) Other intangible assets 41.9 (Estimatedusefullifeof11years) Purchased R&D 6.4 Total assets acquired 202.0 Current liabilities 11.4 Deferred tax liability 29.4 Total liabilities assumed 40.8 Net assets acquired $161.2 The purchase price of $161.2 million includes $2.0 million of direct acquisition costs. Goodwill associated with this transaction is not deductible for tax purposes.
Bridger Biomed, Inc.
- On June 30, 2004, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bridger Biomed, Inc., a supplier of components for the companys soft tissue repair franchise. The acquisition agreement called for a cash payment of $8.1 million, the assumption of certain liabilities and two anniversary payments of $8.1 million payable on the eighteenth and thirty-sixth month anniversaries of the transaction. The company recorded the anniversary payments in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities. The first anniversary payment was made in 2005, and the second anniversary payment was made in 2007.
3. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is based on income from continuing operations before income taxes reported for financial statement purposes. The components of earnings before income taxes were: 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) United States $ 390.5 $ 204.4 $ 250.2 Foreign 186.8 190.2 203.5 Income from continuing operations before tax provision $ 577.3 $ 394.6 $ 453.7 II-40 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following is the composition of the income tax provision: 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Taxes currently payable U.S. Federal $ 145.5 $ 65.1 $ 77.8 Foreign 33.1 22.6 26.1 State 14.7 7.7 7.0 Total currently payable 193.3 95.4 110.9 Deferred tax expense (benefit) U.S. Federal (13.1 ) (15.5 ) (4.6 ) Foreign (9.7 ) 1.4 7.0 State 0.4 (1.2 )  Total deferred tax expense (benefit) (22.4 ) (15.3 ) 2.4 Total income tax provision $ 170.9 $ 80.1 $ 113.3 On certain items, deferred income taxes arise due to the different tax treatment between financial reporting and tax accounting. This differing treatment creates items known as temporary differences. To recognize the future tax consequences of such differences, the company applies enacted statutory rates. The companys deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 (dollarsinmillions) Deferred tax assets Employee benefits $ 83.5 $ 74.1 Inventory (intercompany profit in inventory and excess of tax over book valuation) 20.1 13.4 Receivables / rebates 13.0 11.0 Acquisition related 14.3 19.3 Accrued expenses / other 22.7 19.7 Total deferred tax assets 153.6 137.5 Deferred tax liabilities Accelerated depreciation / amortization 43.8 45.4 Acquisition related 49.1 52.9 Investment related  0.1 Other  0.3 Total deferred tax liabilities 92.9 98.7 Deferred tax assets, net $ 60.7 $ 38.8 The company records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized. The company considers future taxable income and the periods over which it must be earned in assessing the need for valuation allowances. In the event the company determines it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made. Although realization is not assured, the company believes it is more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets will be realized.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following is a reconciliation between the effective income tax rate and the United States federal statutory rate for the years ended December31: 2007 2006 2005 U.S. federal statutory rate 35 % 35 % 35 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 2 % 1 % 1 % Operations taxed at less than U.S. rate (6 )% (10 )% (8 )% Tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the AJCA   7 % Impact of foreign tax reform on deferred taxes (1 )%   Resolution of prior period tax items  (7 )% (10 )% Other, net  1 %  Effective tax rate 30 % 20 % 25 % In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for the company to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings in the form of an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain cash dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the third quarter of 2005, the company approved a plan to repatriate $600 million of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. Accordingly, the company recorded a tax provision of approximately $32 million associated with this plan. The repatriation was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. Consistent with FSP No. FAS 109-2, the company has not provided for income taxes on its residual international unrepatriated earnings.
The companys foreign tax incentives consist of incentive tax grants in Puerto Rico and Malaysia. The Puerto Rico grant was originally effective November 1998. The company applied for a revised grant to be effective as of July 1, 2001 which also provided for a partial exemption from income, property and municipal taxes for a 15-year period effective from the date of revision. In 2002, the company received approval of this revised grant establishing a new lower tax rate for its Puerto Rican manufacturing operations.
During 2003, the company applied for a Malaysian high-technology pioneer grant that would provide for a full tax exemption on operational income by Malaysian Inland Revenue for five years. On February 11, 2004, the company was notified by the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry that the companys application was accepted and would be effective retroactive to July 1, 2003.
The approximate dollar and per share effects of the Puerto Rican and Malaysian grants are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions except per share amounts) Tax benefit $ 35.4 $ 30.2 $ 42.6 Per share benefit $ 0.33 $ 0.28 $ 0.39 The company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax benefit from an uncertain position was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained. Under FIN 48, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is II-42 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date. The impact of adopting FIN 48 on the companys consolidated financial statements is summarized below.
Balanceat December31, 2006 FIN 48 Adjustment Balanceat January1, 2007 (dollars in millions) Accrued expenses $ 101.1 $ (9.5 ) $ 91.6 Income taxes payable 36.3 (44.1 ) (7.8 ) Other long-term liabilities 117.4 48.3 165.7 Retained earnings $ 1,026.8 $ 5.3 $ 1,032.1 A tabular reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows: (dollars in millions) Balance, January 1, 2007 $ 46.4 Additions for tax positions of the current year 10.3 Reductions for tax positions of prior years for: Settlements/resolutions during the period (1.4 ) Balance, December 31, 2007 $ 55.3 The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and outside of the United States, and faces audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions as well as other matters. At January 1, 2007, the total amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes was approximately $46.4 million plus approximately $8.2 million of accrued interest. As of December 31, 2007, the corresponding balance of liability for unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $55.3 million (of which $51.1 million would impact the effective tax rate if recognized) for the items described above plus approximately $11.7 million of accrued interest.
The companys U.S. federal tax filings have been examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for calendar years ending prior to 2000. The company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. In 2005, the companys income tax provision was reduced by $45.6 million predominately due to the favorable conclusion of the IRSs examination of the 1996 through 1999 tax years, as well as the resolution of certain other tax items. In 2006, the companys income tax provision was reduced by approximately $23.8 million, predominantly due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the United States for the 2000 through 2002 tax years as well as the resolution of the U.K. audit for the 1999 through 2003 tax years. An audit of the companys U.S. federal tax filings for the 2003 and 2004 tax years began in the second quarter of 2006. In 2007, the increases in the tax rate were due to changes in the mix of income among tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the revaluation of deferred taxes related to changes in certain statutory tax rates outside the United States.
The companys U.K. affiliates tax filings have been examined by Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom for the tax years ending prior to 2005. The company believes that all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled. An audit of the companys U.K. tax filing for the 2005 year began in the fourth quarter of 2007.
II-43 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The company is currently under examination in several tax jurisdictions and remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective tax jurisdiction. Within specific countries, the company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities, or subsidiaries operating within the country may be subject to different statute of limitations expiration dates. As of December 31, 2007, a summary of the tax years that remain subject to examination in the companys major tax jurisdictions are: United States  federal 2003andforward United States  states 2002 and forward Germany 2001 and forward Malaysia 2001 and forward Puerto Rico 2003 and forward United Kingdom 2005 and forward Based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations and/or the conclusion of tax examinations in several jurisdictions, the company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of previously unrecognized tax benefits for the items discussed above may decrease by up to $20.0 million within 12 months of December 31, 2007.
The company has not provided for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign operations as it is the companys intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings (approximately $899.1 million as of December 31, 2007).
4. Investments Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less and amounted to $458.0 million and $394.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
There were no realized gains or losses on short-term investments reported in the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains (losses) and fair value for short-term investments by major security type at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: December 31, 2007 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized (Losses) FairValue (dollars in millions) Held-to-maturity: Commercial paper $ 10.0 $  $  $ 10.0 Available-for-sale: Corporate debt securities 72.0 0.3 (0.1 ) 72.2 Total short-term investments $ 82.0 $ 0.3 $ (0.1 ) $ 82.2 December 31, 2006 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized (Losses) FairValue (dollars in millions) Held-to-maturity: Time deposits $ 2.6 $  $  $ 2.6 Available-for-sale: Corporate debt securities 98.1 0.3  98.4 Total short-term investments $ 100.7 $ 0.3 $  $ 101.0 II-44 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Because the company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be at maturity, the company does not consider any unrealized losses to be other than temporary at December 31, 2007.
Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair market values are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities in Other assets. Available-for-sale equity securities are recorded at fair market value, with the change in fair market value recorded, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair market value of available-for-sale equity securities was approximately $2.5 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The company donated equity securities with a fair market value of approximately $1.6 million and $1.1 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, to the companys charitable foundation.
For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, other (income) expense, net included investment gains from equity securities of approximately $0.2million, $2.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively.
5. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets using the straight-line method. Useful lives for property and equipment are as follows: Buildings and improvements 1to40years Machinery and equipment 1 to 20 years Depreciation expense was approximately $48.6 million in 2007, $44.6 million in 2006 and $39.0 million in 2005, respectively.

Forecasted amortization expense for the years 2008 through 2012 are as follows based on the companys intangible assets as of December 31, 2007: 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 (dollars in millions) Annual amortization expense $ 32.8 $ 32.1 $ 29.3 $ 27.6 $ 27.6 II-46 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 7. Debt The components of debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) 6.7% notes due 2026 $ 149.8 $ 149.8 Other 0.8 0.8 Total debt 150.6 150.6 Less: Current portion of long-term debt 0.8  Total long-term debt $ 149.8 $ 150.6 On June 28, 2007, the company amended its existing domestic syndicated bank credit facility with a $400 million five-year credit agreement that expires in June 2012. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. There were no outstanding short-term or commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In addition, on October 21, 2005, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the company entered into a $250 million syndicated bank credit facility to be used for general corporate needs including in support of the companys decision in 2005 to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings under the AJCA. Loans under the facility bear interest at the companys option at a fixed spread to LIBOR or the higher of prime rate and 0.50% over the federal funds rate. The facility expires in October 2008. There were no borrowings against the facility during 2007. In 2006, the average outstanding balance of short-term borrowings under this facility was approximately $82.0million with an effective interest rate of 5.33%. At December31, 2007 and 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had outstanding $149.8 million of unsecured notes that mature in 2026 and pay a semi-annual coupon of 6.70%. The coupon interest closely approximates the effective annual cost of the notes. The market value of the notes approximates $158.3 million at December 31, 2007.
At December 31, 2007, the aggregate maturities of long-term debt were as follows: 2008 - $0.8 million; and 2012 and thereafter - $149.8 million.
Certain of the companys debt agreements contain customary representations, warranties and default provisions as well as restrictions that, among other things, require the maintenance of operating cash flow levels and limit the amount of debt that the company may have outstanding. As of December31, 2007, the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants.
II-47 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 8. Other Long-Term Liabilities In connection with the adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the company reclassified $48.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits to long-term liabilities. See Note 3 Income Taxes in these notes to consolidated financial statements. During 2007, the company also reclassified its minority interest balances for the current and prior period from accrued expenses to other long-term liabilities.
The following is a summary of the components of long-term liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in millions) Pension, postretirement benefits and long-term compensation $ 73.8 $ 93.0 Income taxes 67.0  Product liability accruals and other long-term liabilities 26.9 17.8 Minority interest 8.1 6.6 Total long-term liabilities $ 175.8 $ 117.4 9. Derivative Instruments The company enters into readily marketable traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions to help reduce the exposure to fluctuations between certain currencies. These contracts limit volatility because gains and losses associated with exchange rate movements are generally offset by movements in the underlying hedged item.
The table below shows the notional amounts and fair market value of the companys currency-related forward contracts and purchased options as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 NotionalValue FairValue NotionalValue FairValue (dollars in millions) Forward currency agreements $ 126.5 $ (0.8 ) $ 30.7 $ 1.1 Option contracts $  $  $ 64.0 $ 0.5 A roll forward of the notional value of the companys currency-related forward contracts and options for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 is as follows: Forward currency agreements Optioncontracts (dollars in millions) December 31, 2006 notional amount $ 30.7 $ 64.0 New agreements 155.0 83.0 Expired/cancelled agreements (59.2 ) (147.0 ) December 31, 2007 notional amount $ 126.5 $  II-48 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The fair market value of derivative instruments was estimated by discounting expected cash-flows using quoted foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Judgment was employed in developing estimates of fair market value; accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair market value amounts. At December 31, 2007, the net fair market value of option contracts and the incremental mark-to-market of forward currency agreements are recorded in either other current assets or accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2007, the company reclassified a loss of approximately $1.5 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net or cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income as hedged intercompany balances were settled as anticipated. This reclassification was net of approximately $0.5 million of associated tax effects. At December 31, 2007, the company had losses of approximately $1.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet that are expected to be reclassified into earnings in 2008.
10. Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. In addition, the company operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the ordinary course of business, the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against the company, the company might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on its ability to manufacture or distribute one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to the company were to be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the company might be required to reduce the value of the patent on the companys balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount.
The company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials and emissions or discharges into the ground, air or water. The company is or may become a party to proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Actand similar state laws. These proceedings seek to require the owners or operators of contaminated sites, transporters of hazardous materials to the sites and generators of hazardous materials disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most cases, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be liable for any remediation costs. In these cases, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs; however, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more closely reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site contamination. The companys potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites, the potential liability is de minimis and for others the costs of cleanup have not yet been determined.
The company believes that the proceedings and claims described above will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the companys experience, current information and applicable law, the company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. However, one or more of the proceedings could be material to the companys business and results of operations for a future period.
On November 27, 2006, the companys Urological Division received a subpoena issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the authority of the federal healthcare fraud and false claims statutes. The subpoena seeks documents related to the divisions brachytherapy business. The II-49 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) company is cooperating with the governments request and is in the process of responding to the subpoena. At this stage of the inquiry, the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be assessed. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period.
As of February 25, 2008, approximately 580 federal and 280 state lawsuits involving individual claims by approximately 2,135 plaintiffs, as well as nine putative class actions, have been filed or asserted against the company with respect to its Composix  Kugel  product intended for ventral hernia repair (collectively, the Composix Claims). The company voluntarily recalled certain sizes and lots of the product beginning in December 2005. The actions generally seek damages for personal injury resulting from use of the product and theputative class actions, none of which has been certified, also seek (i) medical monitoring, (ii) compensatory damages, (iii) punitive damages, (iv) a judicial finding of defect and causation and/or (v) attorneys fees. On June22, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred Composix lawsuits pending in federal courts nationwide into one Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Approximately 245 of the state lawsuits, involving individual claims by approximately 1,465 plaintiffs, are pending in the Superior Court of the State of Rhode Island, with the remainder in various other jurisdictions.
The Composix Claims are at a preliminary stage. In the vast majority of these cases, we have not yet obtained and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions, and consequently, we are unable to fully evaluate the claims nor determine the time frame in which they may be resolved. As in most litigation of this nature, the Composix Claims present a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. We believe that many settlements and judgments relating to the Composix claims may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies. While the company intends to vigorously defend the Composix Claims, it cannot give any assurances that the Composix Claims will not have a material adverse impact on the companys result of operations in future periods or the companys financial position or liquidity.
On February 21, 2007, Southeast Missouri Hospital filed a purported class action complaint on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against the company and another manufacturer under the caption Southeast Missouri Hospital, et-al. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., et al . (Civil Action No. 1:07-cv-00031, United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Southeastern District). The plaintiff alleges that the company and the other defendant conspired to exclude competitors from the market and to maintain the companys market share by engaging in conduct in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and money damages. Antitrust damages are subject to trebling. The company intends to defend this matter vigorously. At this time, it is not possible to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential damages. The company cannot give any assurances that this matter will not have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations in a future period or the companys financial position or liquidity.
In December 2007, a U.S. District Court jury in Arizona found that certain of W.L. Gore & Associates Inc.s ePTFE vascular grafts and stent-grafts infringe the companys patent number 6,436,135. The jury upheld the validity of the patent and awarded the company $185 million in past damages. The jury also found that Gore willfully infringed the patent. In a second phase of the trial, the court is currently assessing Gores assertion that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Because the company considers this matter a gain contingency, no amounts have been recorded as of December 31, 2007.
The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment. The minimum annual rentals under the terms of these leases are as follows: 2008 - $21.1 million; 2009 - $17.9 II-50 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) million; 2010 - $14.8 million; 2011 - $12.1 million; 2012 - $10.0 million and thereafter - $47.7 million. Total rental expense for operating leases and month-to-month leases approximated $18.8 million in 2007, $19.7 million in 2006 and $20.2 million in 2005.
11. Share-Based Compensation Plans The company may grant a variety of share-based payments under the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc. (the 2003 Plan) and the 2005 Directors Stock Award Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc. (the Directors Plan) to certain directors, officers and employees. The total number of remaining shares at December 31, 2007 that may be issued under the 2003 Plan was 2,377,180 and under the Directors Plan was 105,566. Awards under the 2003 Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock and other stock-based awards. Awards under the Directors Plan may be in the form of stock awards, stock options or stock appreciation rights. The company has two employee share purchase programs.
Effective January1, 2006, the company began recording compensation expense associated with stock options in accordance with FAS123R. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the company accounted for share-based payments according to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, and therefore no related compensation expense was recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value. The company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided for under FAS123R and consequently has not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with share-based payments now includes (1)the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (FAS123), and (2)all share-based payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS123R. In addition, the company records expense over the payroll withholding period and the requisite service period, respectively, in connection with (1)shares issued under its employee stock purchase plan and (2) other share-based payments under the 2003 Plan and Directors Plan. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the company recorded forfeitures as incurred. Upon adoption of FAS 123R, compensation expense for all share-based payments includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the expected term of the share-based awards using the straight-line method. The impact of this change on prior period compensation cost was immaterial.Prior to the companys adoption of FAS123R, benefits for tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. FAS123R requires that they be recorded as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.
Amounts recognized for share-based compensation are as follows: FortheYears EndedDecember31, 2007 2006 2005 (dollars in millions) Total cost of share-based payment plans $ 51.2 $ 47.9 $ 9.3 Amounts capitalized in inventory and fixed assets (1.6 ) (0.9 )  Amounts charged against income for amounts previously capitalized in inventory and fixed assets 1.6   Amounts charged against income before income tax benefit $ 51.2 $ 47.0 $ 9.3 Amount of related income tax benefit recognized in income $ 17.9 $ 16.5 $ 3.3 II-51 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately $73.3 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to share-based payment arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The company repurchases shares from time to time on the open market to satisfy share-based payment arrangements. The company has sufficient treasury shares to satisfy expected share-based payment arrangements.
The following information illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair market value recognition provisions of FAS 123R for the year ended December31, 2005: (dollarsinmillions exceptpershare amounts) Net income as reported $ 337.1 Pro forma after-tax impact of options at fair value 21.7 Pro forma after-tax impact of Employee Stock Purchase Plan discount 1.3 Pro forma net income adjusted $ 314.1 Basic earnings per share as reported $ 3.22 Diluted earnings per share as reported $ 3.12 Pro forma basic earnings per share $ 3.00 Pro forma diluted earnings per share $ 2.91 Stock Options - The company grants stock options to directors, officers and certain employees with exercise prices equal to the average of the high and low prices of the companys common stock on the date of grant. These stock option awards generally have requisite service periods between four and five years and ten-year contractual terms. No expense recognition period extends beyond an individual employees retirement-eligibility date. Certain stock option awards provide for accelerated vesting after a minimum of one year if certain performance conditions are met.

As of December31, 2007, there were approximately $23.0 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately one year. During the year ended December31, 2007, 1,516,316 options vested with a weighted-average fair value of $18.42. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2006 was $85.8 million.
Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $66.1 million and $48.6 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise of share-based payment arrangements totaled $39.6 million and $29.6million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock-Based Awards - The company may grant restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock awards to certain employees and directors.
Nonvested Restricted Stock AwardsRestricted stock is issued to the participants on the date of grant, entitling the participants to dividends and the right to vote their respective shares. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of shares until vested. Certain restricted stock awards have performance features. The fair market value of these restricted shares on the date of grant is recognized to expense ratably over the requisite service period. Currently, outstanding restricted stock grants have requisite service periods of between four to seven years. No expense recognition period extends beyond an individual employees retirement-eligibility date. The company recorded compensation expense related to restricted stock of $9.1 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately $26.3 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock awards. These costs are expected to II-53 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC.

The expense recognition period for certain individuals will be reduced to match their retirement-eligibility date. No voting or dividend rights are associated with these grants until the underlying shares are issued upon vesting. Total compensation expense related to these awards was $2.9 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December31, 2007, there were approximately $15.3 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards.

R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Nonvested Stock AwardsThe company may grant stock awards to directors. Shares are granted at no cost to the recipients and are generally distributed to a director in his or her year of election and vest on a pro rata basis in each year of his or her term, although additional awards may be granted with other terms. The fair market value of these awards is charged to compensation expense over the directors terms. Restrictions limit the sale or transfer of these awards until the awarded stock vests and until an additional two-year period lapses. Dividends are paid on these shares and recipients have the right to vote their respective shares when the shares are distributed. Total compensation expense related to these stock awards was $0.8 million and $0.6million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December31, 2007, there were approximately $0.2million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock awards.

Under the MSPP, employees at a specified level may purchase, with their eligible annual bonus, common stock units at a 30% discount from the lower of the price of the common stock on July1 of the previous year or on the date of purchase, which occurs on the date bonuses are approved by the Board of Directors. Employees make an election on or before June 30 of the previous year as to the percentage of their eligible annual bonus that will be used to purchase common stock units under the MSPP. The companys predecessor plan provided for the purchase of shares of the companys common stock. Employees are required to utilize at least 25% of their eligible annual bonuses to purchase common stock units under the MSPP to the extent they have not satisfied certain stock ownership guidelines. MSPP shares or units are restricted from sale or transfer for four years from the purchase date. Only shares or units corresponding to the 30% discount are forfeited if the employees employment terminates prior to the end of the four-year vesting period. The expense recognition period for certain individuals will be reduced to match their retirement-eligibility date. Dividends or dividend-equivalents are paid on MSPP shares or units, and the participant has the right to vote all MSPP shares.

R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In the third quarter of 2007, the company began using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the expense associated with anticipated 2008 MSPP purchases. The company believes the Black-Scholes model is a more appropriate model to use as a result of the option-like features of the MSPP. For all shares or units associated with the 2007 and prior MSPP purchases, the difference between the market price and the purchase price at the purchase date is amortized ratably over a four-year requisite service period. The company is recognizing the expense associated with 2008 MSPP purchases over a period that will end four years after purchase. The following table outlines the assumptions used: Dividend yield (annual rate) 0.7 % Risk-free interest rate 4.97 % Expected life in years 0.6 Expected volatility 22 % Fair value $ 30.87 The company recognized approximately $7.2 million and $4.1 million of compensation expense related to this program for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately $8.5million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested MSPP shares and units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.
Employee Stock Purchase PlanUnder the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of C. R. Bard, Inc. (ESPP), domestic employees and certain foreign employees can purchase Bard stock at a 15% discount to the lesser of the market price on the beginning or ending date of the six-month periods ending June30 and December31 of each year. Participants may elect to make after-tax payroll deductions of 1% to 10% of compensation as defined by the plan up to a maximum of $25,000 per year. The ESPP is intended to meet the requirements of Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. At December 31, 2007, 103,725 shares were available for purchase under the ESPP. Employee payroll deductions are for six-month periods beginning each January1 and July1. Shares of the companys common stock are purchased on June30 or December31 or the following business day, unless either the purchase of such shares was delayed at the election of the participant or the participants employment was terminated. Purchased shares are restricted for sale or transfer for a six-month period. All participant funds received prior to the ESPP purchase dates are held as company liabilities without interest or other increment. No dividends are paid on employee contributions until shares are purchased.
Beginning January1, 2006 with the companys adoption of FAS 123R, the company began to record compensation expense for the ESPP. The company values the ESPP purchases utilizing the Black-Scholes model. The following table outlines the assumptions used: July2,2007 Purchase December31,2007 Purchase June30,2006 Purchase December31,2006 Purchase Dividend yield (annual rate) 0.8 % 0.7 % 0.7 % 0.8 % Risk-free interest rate 5.07 % 4.97 % 4.47 % 5.17 % Expected life in years 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 Expected volatility 21 % 22 % 16 % 21 % Fair value $ 17.85 $ 18.10 $ 13.23 $ 15.67 II-56 Table of Contents C.

For the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006, employees purchased 117,171 and 106,805 shares, respectively. The company recorded compensation expense related to the ESPP of $1.9 and $1.6 million for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans The company has both tax-qualified and nonqualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that together cover substantially all domestic and certain foreign employees. These plans provide benefits based upon a participants compensation and years of service. The nonqualified plans are made up of the following arrangements: a nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement and a nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement (nonqualified plans). The nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation arrangement provides supplemental income to key executives of the company. The benefit is determined by the accumulation of an account balance that results from a percentage of pay credit and interest. No deferrals of pay are required from participants. The balance is paid to a participant after retirement over a 15-year period. The nonqualified excess pension deferred compensation arrangement provides benefits to key employees that cannot be provided by the qualified plan due to IRS limitations. The company uses a September 30 measurement date for all of its defined benefit pension plans.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158). FAS 158 requires, among other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan, with subsequent changes in the funded status recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders investment. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The impact of the initial adoption of FAS 158 for the companys defined benefit pension plans reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $29.1 million.

The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
Assumptions on expected long-term rate-of-return - The company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Under this approach, the historical real returns (net of inflation) on different asset classes are combined with long-term expectations for inflation to determine an expected return on assets within that class. These real rates of return for each asset class reflect the long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income investments and are consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is established based on the combination of these asset class real returns and inflation with proper consideration of the effects of diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for appropriateness.
Plan Assets and Investment Targets - Plan assets for the tax-qualified plans consist of a diversified portfolio of equity securities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents. Plan assets did not include any company securities at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The breakdown of tax-qualified plan assets was as follows: September30, 2007 September30, 2006 (dollars in millions) U.S. tax-qualified plan $ 184.3 $ 163.6 Non-U.S. plans 57.9 45.2 Total $ 242.2 $ 208.8 II-60 Table of Contents C. R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The weighted average actual and target asset allocations for the tax-qualified plans are as follows: ActualAllocation TargetAllocation September30, September30, September30, September30, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Asset Categories Equity securities 64.9 % 64.5 % 61.3 % 61.4 % Fixed income securities 33.0 % 33.8 % 33.4 % 33.6 % Cash and other 2.1 % 1.7 % 5.3 % 5.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Due to short-term returns, the investment mix may temporarily fall outside of the targets pending rebalancing to the long-term targets. Cash investment balances are targeted at five percent and are used to satisfy benefit disbursement requirements and will vary throughout the year.
Investment Strategies - The company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by exceeding the interest growth in plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. This consideration involves the use of long-term measures that address both return and risk and are not impacted significantly by short-term fluctuations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore, equity investments include a diversified mix of growth, value and small and large capitalization securities. Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
Funding Policy and Expected Contributions - The companys objective in funding its domestic tax-qualified plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of ERISA. Outside the United States, the companys objective is to fund the international retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions. The companys annual funding decisions also consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plans asset returns compared to the plans corresponding expense and consider the relationship between each tax-qualified plans benefit obligation and its corresponding funded status. In 2007, the company made voluntary contributions of $15.0 million to the companys U.S. tax-qualified plan and $6.8 million to the companys non-U.S. tax-qualified plans. In 2006, the company made voluntary contributions of $12.0 million to the companys U.S. tax-qualified plan and $2.6 million to the companys non-U.S. tax-qualified plans. The company will consider the factors identified above in determining its 2008 pension funding. The nonqualified plans include supplemental plans which are generally not funded.
The following chart summarizes the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five measurement years and in aggregate for the following five years. The expected benefit payments are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the companys benefit obligation at September 30, 2007 and reflect the impact of expected future employee service.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Defined Contribution Retirement Plans All domestic employees of the company not covered by a collective bargaining agreement who have been scheduled for 1,000 hours of service are eligible to participate in the companys defined contribution plan. The amounts charged to income for this plan amounted to $7.5 million, $7.2 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Outside the United States, the company maintains defined contribution plans and small pension arrangements that are typically funded with insurance products. These arrangements had a total 2007 expense of $1.6 million. In addition, the company maintains a long-term deferred compensation arrangement for directors which allows deferral of the annual retainer and meeting fees at the directors election. In addition, the company annually accrues for long-term compensation which is paid out upon the directors retirement from the board. These arrangement had a total 2007 expense of $1.6 million.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The company does not provide subsidized postretirement healthcare benefits and life insurance coverage except for a limited number of former employees. The measurement date used to determine other postretirement benefit measures for the postretirement benefit plan is December 31. As this plan is unfunded, contributions are made as benefits are incurred.
The impact of the initial adoption of FAS 158 on the companys other postretirement benefit plans reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $2.6 million.

R. BARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Assumed healthcare cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans. Due to limits placed on costs for more recent retirees, however, the impact of these trends on the plans costs is somewhat reduced. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects : One-Percentage Point Increase One-Percentage Point Decrease (dollars in millions) Effect on total of service cost and interest cost components   Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 0.6 $ (0.5 ) The discount rate was determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rate is consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
The following chart summarizes the benefits expected to be paid in each of the next five measurement years and in aggregate for the following five years. The expected benefit payments are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the companys benefit obligation at December31, 2007.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures The company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well defined and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
The companys management, with the participation of the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007. Based, as of December 31, 2007, upon that evaluation, the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives.
The company is in the process of implementing a new ERP information system to manage its business operations. Although the transition has proceeded to date without material adverse effects, the possibility exists that our migration to the new ERP information system could adversely affect the companys controls and procedures. The process of implementing new information systems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner: accept and process customer orders, receive inventory and ship products, invoice and collect receivables, place purchase orders and pay invoices and perform all other business transactions related to the finance, including order entry, purchasing and supply chain processes within the ERP system.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that management document and test the companys internal control over financial reporting and include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting.
