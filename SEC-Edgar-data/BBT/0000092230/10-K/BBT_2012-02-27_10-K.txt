3 Table of Contents OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS General BB&T Corporation (BB&T, the Company or the Corporation), is a financial holding company headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. BB&T conducts its business operations primarily through its commercial bank subsidiary, Branch Banking and Trust Company (Branch Bank), which has offices in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Florida, Indiana and Washington, D.C. In addition, BB&Ts operations consist of a federally chartered thrift institution, BB&T Financial, FSB (BB&T FSB), and several nonbank subsidiaries, which offer financial services products. Substantially all of the loans by BB&Ts subsidiaries are to businesses and individuals in these market areas.
Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of BB&T. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the management of BB&T and the information available to management at the time that these disclosures were prepared. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:  general economic or business conditions, either nationally or regionally, may be less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality and/or a reduced demand for credit or other services;  changes in the interest rate environment may reduce net interest margins and/or the volumes and values of loans made or held as well as the value of other financial assets held;  competitive pressures among depository and other financial institutions may increase significantly;  legislative or regulatory changes, including changes in accounting standards, may adversely affect the businesses in which BB&T is engaged;  local, state or federal taxing authorities may take tax positions that are adverse to BB&T;  adverse changes may occur in the securities markets;  competitors of BB&T may have greater financial resources and develop products that enable them to compete more successfully than BB&T;  costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses of BB&T and its merger partners may be greater than expected;  expected cost savings associated with completed mergers may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frames; and  deposit attrition, customer loss or revenue loss following completed mergers may be greater than expected.
Risk Factors Related to BB&Ts Business Changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs and reduce BB&Ts net income and growth.
BB&Ts business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on the Companys operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur. BB&Ts banking operations are locally oriented and community-based. Accordingly, the Company expects to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the local residential and commercial real estate markets it serves. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or increases in interest rates, as well as 4 Table of Contents other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities BB&T serves. Weakness in BB&Ts market area could depress the Companys earnings and consequently its financial condition because:  customers may not want or need BB&Ts products or services;  borrowers may not be able to repay their loans;  the value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may decline; and  the quality of BB&Ts loan portfolio may decline.
Any of the latter three scenarios could require the Company to charge off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase provisions for credit losses, which would reduce the Companys net income. For example, beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing through 2008, BB&T experienced increasing credit deterioration due to ongoing challenges in the residential real estate markets. This period of credit deterioration combined with flat to declining real estate values resulted in increasing loan charge-offs and higher provisions for credit losses, which negatively impacted BB&Ts net income.
Weakness in the markets for residential or commercial real estate, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, could reduce BB&Ts net income and profitability.
Since 2007, softening residential housing markets, increasing delinquency and default rates, and increasingly volatile and constrained secondary credit markets have been affecting the mortgage industry generally. BB&Ts financial results have been adversely affected by changes in real estate values, primarily in Georgia, Florida and metro Washington, D.C. Decreases in real estate values have adversely affected the value of property used as collateral for loans and investments in BB&Ts portfolio. The poor economic conditions experienced in 2007 and 2008 resulted in decreased demand for real estate loans, and BB&Ts net income and profits have suffered as a result.
The declines in home prices in many markets across the U.S., including a number of markets in BB&Ts banking footprint (primarily Georgia, Florida and metro Washington, D.C.), along with the reduced availability of mortgage credit, has also resulted in increases in delinquencies and losses in BB&Ts portfolio of loans related to residential real estate, including its acquisition, development and construction loan portfolio. Further declines in home prices within BB&Ts banking footprint (including markets that to date have not experienced significant declines) coupled with a deepening economic recession and associated rises in unemployment levels could drive losses beyond the levels provided for in BB&Ts allowance for loan losses. In that event, BB&Ts earnings would be adversely affected.
Significant ongoing disruption in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans has limited the market for and liquidity of most mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the ongoing correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales has resulted in price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held and mortgage loan originations. Continued declines in real estate values and home sales volumes within BB&Ts banking footprint, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, or other factors, could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would adversely affect BB&Ts financial condition and results of operations.
Market developments may adversely affect BB&Ts industry, business and results of operations.
Significant declines in the housing market in recent months, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by many financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. To date, BB&T has not experienced material asset write downs and it has produced quarterly earnings during 2007 and 2008, however, during this time BB&T has experienced significant challenges, its credit quality has deteriorated and its net income and results of operations have been adversely 5 Table of Contents impacted. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions. Although to date BB&T has performed relatively well during the current financial crisis as compared with the Companys peers and several of the largest financial institutions, BB&T is part of the financial system and a systemic lack of available credit, a lack of confidence in the financial sector, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect BB&Ts business, financial condition and results of operations.
The capital and credit markets have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility.
During 2008, the capital and credit markets experienced extended volatility and disruption. In the third quarter of 2008, the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength. If these levels of market disruption and volatility continue, worsen or abate and then arise at a later date, BB&Ts ability to access capital could be materially impaired. BB&Ts inability to access the capital markets could constrain the Companys ability to make new loans, to meet the Companys existing lending commitments and, ultimately, jeopardize the Companys overall liquidity and capitalization.
In response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets and the potential threats to the solvency of investment banks and other financial institutions, the U.S. government has taken unprecedented actions. These actions include the government assisted acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, the federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the plan of the United States Department of the Treasury (the Treasury Department) to inject capital and to purchase mortgage loans and mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets or particular financial institutions. Investors should not assume that these governmental actions will necessarily benefit the financial markets in general, or BB&T in particular. BB&T could also be adversely impacted if one or more of its direct competitors are beneficiaries of selective governmental interventions (such as FDIC assisted transactions) and BB&T does not receive comparable assistance. Further, investors should not assume that the government will continue to intervene in the financial markets at all. Investors should be aware that governmental intervention (or the lack thereof) could materially and adversely affect BB&Ts business, financial condition and results of operations.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BB&T.
Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BB&T has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due BB&T. These types of losses could materially and adversely affect BB&Ts results of operations or earnings.
Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on BB&Ts profitability.
BB&Ts earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads, meaning the difference between interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect BB&Ts earnings and financial condition. The Company cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board, affect interest income and interest expense. The Company has ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on BB&Ts profitability. For example, high interest rates could adversely affect the Companys mortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgage refinancings or purchase mortgages.
6 Table of Contents Changes in banking laws could have a material adverse effect on BB&T.
BB&T is extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. In addition, the Company is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations, and governmental economic and monetary policies. BB&T cannot predict whether any of these changes may adversely and materially affect the Company. The current regulatory environment for financial institutions entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs, including those related to consumer credit, with a focus on mortgage lending. For example, the North Carolina legislature has passed a number of bills that impose additional requirements, limitations and liabilities on mortgage loan brokers, originators and servicers. Generally, these enactments cover banks as well as state-licensed mortgage lenders. The legislatures of other states, such as Georgia, Maryland and South Carolina, may enact similar legislation in the future.
Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and limitations on BB&Ts activities that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and profitability.
Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address the current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry may significantly affect BB&Ts financial condition, results of operation, liquidity or stock price.
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA), which established the Treasury Departments Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), was enacted on October3, 2008. As part of the TARP, the Treasury Department created the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), under which the Treasury Department will invest up to $250 billion in senior preferred stock of U.S. banks and savings associations or their holding companies for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. On February17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ARRA) was enacted as a sweeping economic recovery package intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure, energy, health, and education needs. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact that EESA or its programs, including the CPP, and ARRA or its programs, will have on the national economy or financial markets. The failure of these significant legislative measures to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect BB&Ts financial condition, results of operation, liquidity or stock price.
In addition, there have been numerous actions undertaken in connection with or following EESA and ARRA by the Federal Reserve Board, Congress, the Treasury Department, the FDIC, the SEC and others in efforts to address the current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry that followed the sub-prime mortgage market meltdown which began in late 2007. These measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification; the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks; the lowering of the federal funds rate; emergency action against short selling practices; a temporary guaranty program for money market funds; the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back-stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers; a mandatory stress test requirement for banking institutions with assets in excess of $100 billion to analyze capital sufficiency and risk exposure; and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector. The purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to help stabilize the U.S. banking system. However, the EESA, the ARRA and any current or future legislative or regulatory initiatives may not have their desired effect, or may have an adverse effect when applied to BB&T.
BB&T may experience significant competition in its market area, which may reduce the Companys customer base.
There is intense competition among commercial banks in BB&Ts market area. In addition, BB&T competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, the mutual funds industry, full-service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations than BB&T is with respect to the products and services they provide. Some of BB&Ts larger 7 Table of Contents competitors, including certain national banks that have a significant presence in BB&Ts market area, may have greater resources than BB&T, may have higher lending limits and may offer products and services not offered by BB&T.
BB&T also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside of the Companys market area. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and may thus be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer who can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect BB&Ts operations, and the Company may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.
Maintaining or increasing BB&Ts market share may depend on lowering prices and market acceptance of new products and services.
BB&Ts success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce BB&Ts net interest margin and revenues from its fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require the Company to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in BB&Ts business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The Company may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.
Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.
Geopolitical conditions may affect BB&Ts earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.
Unpredictable catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on BB&T.
The occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, pandemic disease, windstorms, floods, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and other catastrophes could adversely affect BB&Ts consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Company in that such events could materially disrupt its operations or the ability or willingness of its customers to access the financial services offered by BB&T. The Companys property and casualty insurance operations also expose it to claims arising out of catastrophes. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although the Company carries insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, catastrophic events could nevertheless reduce BB&Ts earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on BB&Ts financial condition or results of operations.
BB&T faces significant operational risk.
BB&T is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from BB&Ts actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect BB&Ts ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.
Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. BB&Ts necessary 8 Table of Contents dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. BB&T also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. BB&T is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is BB&T) and to the risk that BB&Ts (or its vendors) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.
The Treasury Departments investment in BB&T imposes restrictions and obligations limiting BB&Ts ability to increase dividends, repurchase common stock or preferred stock and access the equity capital markets.
In November 2008, BB&T issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock to the Treasury Department under the CPP. Prior to November14, 2011, unless BB&T has redeemed all of the preferred stock, or the Treasury Department has transferred all of the preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury Department will be required for BB&T to, among other things, increase common stock dividends or effect repurchases of common stock or other preferred stock (with certain exceptions, including the repurchase of BB&T common stock to offset share dilution from equity-based employee compensation awards). BB&T has also granted registration rights to the Treasury Department pursuant to which BB&T has agreed to lock-up periods prior to and following the effective date of an underwritten offering of the preferred stock, the warrant or the underlying common stock held by the Treasury Department, during such time when BB&T would be unable to issue equity securities.
BB&Ts liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or an unforeseen outflow of cash.
Liquidity is essential to BB&Ts businesses. Due to circumstances that BB&T may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or BB&T, BB&Ts liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or an unforeseen outflow of cash. BB&Ts credit ratings are important to its liquidity. A reduction in BB&Ts credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets or trigger unfavorable contractual obligations.
BB&Ts reported financial results depend on managements selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.
BB&Ts accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the methods by which the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Companys management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect managements judgment of the most appropriate manner to report BB&Ts financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in the Company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.
Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting BB&Ts financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include: the allowance for credit losses; the determination of fair value for financial instruments; the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; the accounting for pension and postretirement benefits and the accounting for income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; recognize significant impairment on its goodwill and other intangible asset balances; or significantly increase its accrued taxes liability.
BB&Ts business could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled people.
BB&Ts success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which the Company engages can be intense. As a result of BB&Ts participation 9 Table of Contents in the CPP, BB&T is required to meet certain standards for executive compensation as set forth under the EESA, and related interim regulations. The recently enacted ARRA requires the Treasury Department to adopt additional standards with respect to executive compensation and governance that may impact certain of BB&Ts executive officers and employees. Such restrictions imposed as a result of the Treasury Departments investment in BB&T, in addition to other competitive pressures, may have an adverse effect on the ability of BB&T to attract and retain skilled personnel, resulting in BB&T not being able to hire the best people or to retain them.
BB&T relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure.
Third party vendors provide key components of BB&Ts business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and mutual fund distribution. While BB&T has selected these third party vendors carefully, its does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect BB&Ts ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.
Significant litigation could have a material adverse effect on BB&T.
BB&T faces legal risks in its business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against BB&T may have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to BB&T, which in turn could seriously harm BB&Ts business prospects.
BB&T faces systems failure risks as well as security risks, including hacking and identity theft.
The computer systems and network infrastructure BB&T and others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in both the Companys internally developed systems and the systems of its third-party service providers. The Companys operations are dependent upon its ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss or telecommunication failure. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in the Companys operations could adversely affect BB&Ts business and financial results. In addition, the Companys computer systems and network infrastructure present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft.
Differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact BB&Ts financial statements.
Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than BB&T and challenge tax positions that BB&T has taken on its tax returns. This may result in the disallowance of deductions or credits, and/or differences in the timing of deductions and result in the payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could materially affect BB&Ts performance.
Changes in accounting standards could materially impact BB&Ts financial statements.
From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of BB&Ts financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings.
BB&T may not be able to successfully integrate bank or nonbank mergers and acquisitions.
Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of bank holding companies, banks and other nonbank entities BB&T acquires and, as a result, the Company may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that it expects will result from such transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the integration of the acquired or merged entitys businesses with BB&T or one of BB&Ts subsidiaries, the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of the core operating systems, data systems and products may result in the loss of 10 Table of Contents customers, damage to BB&Ts reputation within the financial services industry, operational problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such mergers or acquisitions. Annual cost savings in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the holding company, bank merger or nonbank merger or acquisition is delayed unexpectedly, the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the conversion to a single data system is not accomplished on a timely basis.
Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause the Company not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of BB&Ts businesses or the businesses of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect the Companys ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.
BB&T may not receive the regulatory approvals required to complete a bank merger.
BB&T must generally receive federal and/or state regulatory approvals before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institutions record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. In addition, BB&T cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. In specific cases the Company may be required to sell banks or branches, or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval.
BB&Ts stock price can be volatile.
BB&Ts stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including:  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;  recommendations by securities analysts;  new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;  significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or the Companys competitors;  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to BB&T;  news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;  changes in government regulations; and  geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.
General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, or currency fluctuations could also cause BB&Ts stock price to decrease regardless of the Companys operating results.

Executive Overview Significant accomplishments in 2008 In the opinion of BB&Ts management, the Corporations most significant accomplishments during 2008 were as follows (amounts include the impact of acquisitions where applicable):  Superior performance relative to the industry  Average loans increased 8.2%  Average deposits increased 6.4%  Fee income increased 10.3%  Effective expense control  Asset quality remained healthier than peers  94,000 net new transaction deposit accounts were added  Households utilizing 5 or more BB&T services grew to 34%  The number of clients utilizing online banking services increased 21% to approximately three million  30 de novo branch locations were opened  Maintained superior service quality as measured by an independent survey company  Launched successful advertising campaign  Best Bank in Town Since 1872  Acquisitions of several nonbank financial services companies were completed 14 Table of Contents Challenges BB&Ts business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years. Consequently, management has annually evaluated and, as necessary, adjusted the Corporations business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. During this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the Company and its expectations for future economic activity, both on a national and local market scale. The achievement of BB&Ts key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. In the opinion of management, the challenges that are most relevant and likely to have a near term impact on performance are presented below:  Downturn in the residential real estate market  Effectively managing through the credit cycle  Unprecedented disruption and significantly increased risk in financial markets  Cost and risk associated with the current heightened regulatory environment  Intense competition within the financial services industry Competition The financial services industry is highly competitive and dramatic change continues to occur in all aspects of the Companys business. The ability of nonbank financial entities to provide services previously reserved for commercial banks has intensified competition. BB&Ts subsidiaries compete actively with national, regional and local financial services providers, including banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers, finance companies and insurance companies. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The industry continues to consolidate, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers. In addition, many financial services are experiencing significant challenges as a result of the economic crisis, resulting in bank and thrift failures and significant intervention from the U.S. Government. For additional information concerning markets, BB&Ts competitive position and business strategies, and recent government interventions see Market Area, General Business Development and Regulatory Considerations below.
Market Area BB&Ts primary market area consists of North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, eastern Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, Florida and Washington, D.C. This areas employment base is diverse and primarily consists of manufacturing, general services, agricultural, wholesale/retail trade, technology and financial services. BB&T believes its current market area will support growth in assets and deposits in the future. Management strongly believes that BB&Ts community bank approach to providing client service is a competitive advantage that strengthens the Corporations ability to effectively provide financial products and services to businesses and individuals in its markets.
General Business Development BB&T is a regional financial holding company. BB&T has maintained a long-term focus on a strategy that includes expanding and diversifying the BB&T franchise in terms of revenues, profitability and asset size. During the 1990s and the first part of this decade, BB&Ts growth resulted largely from mergers and acquisitions as the economics of business combinations were compelling. Recently, BB&T has focused more on organic growth. Tangible evidence of this focus is the growth in average total assets, loans and deposits, which have increased over the last five years at compound annual rates of 9.9%, 10.5%, and 9.3%, respectively.
Merger Strategy BB&Ts growth in business, profitability and market share has historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and acquisitions. Management intends to remain disciplined and focused with regard to future merger 15 Table of Contents and acquisition opportunities. BB&T will continue to assess bank and thrift acquisitions subject to market conditions and suitable candidates, primarily within BB&Ts existing footprint, and will pursue economically advantageous acquisitions of insurance agencies, specialized lending businesses, and fee income generating financial services businesses. BB&Ts acquisition strategy is focused on three primary objectives:  to pursue acquisitions of banks and thrifts with compatible cultures that will enhance BB&Ts banking network and customer delivery system;  to acquire companies in niche markets that provide products or services that can be offered through the existing distribution system to BB&Ts current customer base; and  to consider strategic nonbank acquisitions in markets that are economically feasible and provide positive long-term benefits.
BB&T completed acquisitions of 40 community banks and thrifts, 85 insurance agencies and 33 nonbank financial services providers over the last fifteen years. In the long-term, BB&T expects to continue to take advantage of the consolidation in the financial services industry and expand and enhance its franchise through mergers and acquisitions. The consideration paid for these acquisitions may be in the form of cash, debt or BB&T common stock. The amount of consideration paid to complete these transactions may be in excess of the book value of the underlying net assets acquired, which could have a dilutive effect on BB&Ts earnings. In addition, acquisitions often result in significant front-end charges against earnings; however, cost savings and revenue enhancements, especially incident to in-market bank and thrift acquisitions, are also typically anticipated.
Lending Activities The primary goal of the BB&T lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the Corporation. Management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong, profitable client relationships over time, with BB&T becoming an important contributor to the prosperity and well-being of its clients. In addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, BB&Ts lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth local market knowledge. Furthermore, the Corporation employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. In this context, BB&T strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality.
BB&T conducts the majority of its lending activities within the framework of the Corporations community bank operating model, with lending decisions made as close to the client as practicable.
16 Table of Contents The following table summarizes BB&Ts loan portfolio based on the regulatory classification of the portfolio, which focuses on the underlying loan collateral, and differs from internal classifications presented herein that focus on the primary purpose of the loan.
Table 2 Composition of Loan and Lease Portfolio December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Commercial, financial and agricultural loans $ 17,131 $ 14,037 $ 10,848 $ 9,532 $ 8,824 Lease receivables 2,007 3,899 4,358 4,250 4,170 Real estateconstruction and land development loans 20,065 19,474 17,553 11,942 8,601 Real estatemortgage loans 46,772 44,687 42,219 41,539 39,257 Consumer loans 12,018 11,107 10,389 9,604 9,238 Total loans and leases held for investment 97,993 93,204 85,367 76,867 70,090 Less: unearned income (748 ) (2,297 ) (2,456 ) (2,473 ) (2,540 ) Net loans and leases held for investment 97,245 90,907 82,911 74,394 67,550 Loans held for sale 1,424 779 680 629 613 Total loans and leases $ 98,669 $ 91,686 $ 83,591 $ 75,023 $ 68,163 BB&Ts loan portfolio is approximately 50% commercial and 50% retail by design, and is divided into six major categoriescommercial, sales finance, revolving credit, direct retail, mortgage and specialized lending. BB&T lends to a diverse customer base that is substantially located within the Corporations primary market area. At the same time, the loan portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout BB&Ts branch network to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns.
The following discussion presents the principal types of lending conducted by BB&T and describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of BB&Ts lending function. The relative risk of each loan portfolio is presented in the Asset Quality section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
Underwriting Approach Recognizing that the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability, proper loan underwriting is critical to BB&Ts long-term financial success. BB&Ts underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that ensure credit relationships conform to BB&Ts risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:  Cash flow and debt service coverage cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans not clearly supported by a borrowers cash flow must be justified by secondary repayment sources.
Secondary sources of repayment alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.
Value of any underlying collateral loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrowers normal cash flows.
Overall creditworthiness of the customer, taking into account the customers relationships, both past and current, with other lenders our success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.
Level of equity invested in the transaction in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.
17 Table of Contents Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio The commercial loan and lease portfolio represents the largest category of the Corporations total loan portfolio. BB&Ts commercial lending program is generally targeted to serve small-to-middle market businesses with sales of $200 million or less. In addition, BB&Ts Corporate Banking Group provides lending solutions to large corporate clients. Traditionally, lending to small and mid-sized businesses has been among BB&Ts strongest market segments.
Commercial and small business loans are primarily originated through BB&Ts banking network. In accordance with the Corporations lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates BB&Ts underwriting approach, procedures and evaluations described above. In addition, Branch Bank has adopted an internal maximum credit exposure lending limit of $245 million for a best grade credit, which is considerably below Branch Banks maximum legal lending limit. Commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or a fixed-rate. Commercial loans are individually monitored and reviewed for any possible deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. Approximately 92% of BB&Ts commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral. BB&Ts commercial leases consist of investments in various types of leveraged lease transactions.
Sales Finance Loan Portfolio The sales finance category primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the BB&T market area. These loans are relatively homogenous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Sales finance loans are subject to the same rigorous lending policies and procedures as described above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the Corporations risk philosophy. In addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, BB&T uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its sales finance portfolio. Also included in the sales finance category are commercial lines, serviced by the Sales Finance Department, to finance dealer wholesale inventory (Floor Plan Lines) for resale to consumers. Floor Plan Lines are underwritten by commercial loan officers in compliance with the same rigorous lending policies described above for commercial loans. In addition, Floor Plan Lines are subject to intensive monitoring and oversight to ensure quality and mitigate risk from fraud.
Revolving Credit Loan Portfolio The revolving credit portfolio is comprised of the outstanding balances on credit cards and BB&Ts checking account overdraft protection product, Constant Credit. BB&T markets credit cards to its existing banking client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. Such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed by BB&T FSB.
Direct Retail Loan Portfolio The direct retail loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through BB&Ts banking network. Various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing clients and to other creditworthy candidates in BB&Ts market area. The vast majority of direct retail loans are secured by first or second liens on residential real estate, and include both closed-end home equity loans and revolving home equity lines of credit. Direct retail loans are subject to the same rigorous lending policies and procedures as described above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the Corporations risk philosophy Mortgage Loan Portfolio BB&T is a large originator of residential mortgage loans, with originations in 2008 totaling $16.4 billion. Branch Bank offers various types of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. BB&T primarily originates conforming mortgage loans and higher quality 18 Table of Contents jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied properties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). They are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
Risks associated with the mortgage lending function include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of substantially all conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective mortgage servicing rights hedge process. Borrower risk is lessened through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. The right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. Management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing is a primary relationship driver in retail banking and a vital part of managements strategy to establish profitable long-term customer relationships and offer high quality client service. BB&T also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.
Specialized Lending Portfolio BB&Ts specialized lending portfolio consists of loans originated through six business units that provide specialty finance alternatives to consumers and businesses including: dealer-based financing of equipment for small businesses and consumers, commercial equipment leasing and finance, direct and indirect consumer finance, insurance premium finance, indirect subprime automobile finance, and full-service commercial mortgage banking. BB&T offers these services to bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and outside BB&Ts primary geographic market area.
BB&Ts specialized lending subsidiaries adhere to the same overall underwriting approach as the commercial and consumer lending portfolio and also utilize automated credit scoring to assist with underwriting the credit risk. The majority of these loans are relatively homogenous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. The majority of the loans are secured by real estate, automobiles, equipment or unearned insurance premiums. As of December31, 2008, included in the specialized lending portfolio are loans to subprime borrowers of approximately $2.7 billion, or 2.8% of the total BB&T loan and lease portfolio. Of these, approximately $380 million are residential real estate loans and included in the disclosures in Table 6 herein.
19 Table of Contents The following table presents BB&Ts total loan portfolio based upon the primary purpose of the loan, as discussed herein, rather than upon regulatory reporting classifications: Table 3 Composition of Loan and Lease Portfolio Based on Loan Purpose December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Loans and leases, net of unearned income: Commercial loans $ 49,727 $ 43,685 $ 39,580 $ 34,965 $ 31,968 Leveraged leases 753 1,185 1,720 1,650 1,576 Total commercial loans and leases 50,480 44,870 41,300 36,615 33,544 Sales finance 6,354 6,021 5,683 5,264 5,176 Revolving credit 1,777 1,618 1,414 1,347 1,277 Direct retail 15,454 15,691 15,312 14,453 13,585 Residential mortgage loans 17,091 17,467 15,596 13,971 11,715 Specialized lending 6,089 5,240 3,606 2,744 2,253 Total loans held for investment 97,245 90,907 82,911 74,394 67,550 Total loans held for sale 1,424 779 680 629 613 Total loans and leases $ 98,669 $ 91,686 $ 83,591 $ 75,023 $ 68,163 The following table reflects the scheduled maturities of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, as well as real estate construction loans: Table 4 Selected Loan Maturities and Interest Sensitivity (1) December 31, 2008 Commercial, Financial and Agricultural Real Estate: Construction Total (Dollars in millions) Fixed rate: 1 year or less (2) $ 1,858 $ 931 $ 2,789 1-5 years 1,892 1,878 3,770 After 5 years 2,535 3,079 5,614 Total 6,285 5,888 12,173 Variable rate: 1 year or less (2) 6,665 8,452 15,117 1-5 years 3,301 4,462 7,763 After 5 years 880 1,263 2,143 Total 10,846 14,177 25,023 Total loans and leases (3) $ 17,131 $ 20,065 $ 37,196 (1) Balances include unearned income.

Determinations of maturities are based upon contract terms. BB&Ts credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the customer generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments The allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based on managements best estimate of probable losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. BB&Ts allowance is driven by existing conditions and observations, and reflects losses already incurred, even if not yet identifiable.
The Corporation determines the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Those estimates may be susceptible to significant change. Increases to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans or leases deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance.
In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, BB&T also estimates probable losses related to binding unfunded lending commitments. The methodology to determine such losses is inherently similar to the methodology used in calculating the allowance for commercial loans, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made by charges or credits to the provision for credit losses.
Reserve Policy and Methodology The allowance for loan and lease losses consists of (1)a component for individual loan impairment recognized and measured pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, and (2)components of collective loan impairment recognized pursuant to SFAS No.5, Accounting for Contingencies, including a component that is unallocated. BB&T maintains specific reserves for individually impaired loans pursuant to SFAS No.114. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that BB&T will be unable to collect all amounts due (interest as well as principal) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. On a quarterly basis, BB&T reviews all commercial lending relationships with outstanding debt of $2 million or more that have been classified as substandard or doubtful. Loans are considered impaired when the borrower does not have the cash flow capacity or willingness to service the debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that the borrower will continue to pay according to the contractual agreement. The amount of impairment is based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, and/or the value of collateral adjusted for any origination costs and nonrefundable fees that existed at the time of origination.
Reserves established pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.5 for collective impairment reflect an estimate of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet reporting date. Embedded loss estimates are based on current migration rates and current risk mix. Embedded loss estimates may be adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio trends including credit quality, concentrations, aging of the portfolio, and significant policy and underwriting changes. In the commercial lending portfolio, each loan is 21 Table of Contents assigned a risk grade at origination by the account officer and the assigned risk grade is subsequently reviewed and finalized through BB&Ts established loan review committee process. Loans are assigned risk grades based on an assessment of conditions that affect the borrowers ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing borrowers financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each borrower. The established risk management regimen includes a review of all credit relationships with total credit exposure of $1 million or more on an annual basis or at any point management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers ability to fulfill their obligations. For small business and commercial clients where total credit exposure is less than $1 million, BB&T has developed an automated loan review system to identify and proactively manage accounts with a higher risk of loss. The score produced by this automated system is updated monthly. All of the loan portfolios grouped in the retail lending and specialized lending categories typically employ scoring models to segment credits into groups with homogenous risk characteristics. Scoring models are validated on a periodic basis in order to ensure reliable default rate information. This information is employed to evaluate the levels of risk associated with new production as well as to assess any risk migration in the existing portfolio.
A small portion of the Corporations allowance for loan and lease losses is not allocated to any specific category of loans. This unallocated portion of the allowance reflects managements best estimate of the elements of imprecision and estimation risk inherent in the calculation of the overall allowance. Due to the subjectivity involved in determining the overall allowance, including the unallocated portion, the portion considered unallocated may fluctuate from period to period based on managements evaluation of the factors affecting the assumptions used in calculating the allowance, including historical loss experience, current economic conditions, industry or borrower concentrations and the status of merged institutions. The allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance are available to absorb losses in any loan or lease category. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of the allocated and unallocated components.
While management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance or to the reserving methodology may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations.
The following table presents an estimated allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses at the end of each of the past five years. This allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses or allocations.

Investment Activities Investment securities represent a significant portion of BB&Ts assets. Branch Bank invests in securities as allowable under bank regulations. These securities include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, U.S. government sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, privately-issued mortgage-backed securities, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations, including corporate debentures, commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities. Branch Bank also may deal in securities subject to the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Scott& Stringfellow, LLC, BB&Ts full-service brokerage and investment banking subsidiary, engages in the underwriting, trading and sales of equity and debt securities subject to the risk management policies of the Corporation.
BB&Ts investment activities are governed internally by a written, board-approved policy. The investment policy is carried out by the Corporations Market Risk and Liquidity Committee (MRLC), which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLC also has much 25 Table of Contents broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the Market Risk Management section in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
Investment strategies are established by the MRLC based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the Corporation. In general, the investment portfolio is managed in a manner appropriate to the attainment of the following goals: (i)to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii)to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits as prescribed by law and other borrowings; and (iii)to earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i)and (ii).
Funding Activities Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investing activities, and their cost is the largest category of interest expense. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as longer-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. BB&Ts funding activities are monitored and governed through BB&Ts overall asset/liability management process, which is further discussed in the Market Risk Management section in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein. BB&T conducts its funding activities in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Following is a brief description of the various sources of funds used by BB&T. For further discussion relating to outstanding balances and balance fluctuations, refer to the Deposits and Other Borrowings section in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
Deposits Deposits are attracted principally from clients within BB&Ts branch network through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money rate savings accounts, investor deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i)the interest rates offered by competitors, (ii)the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii)the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv)the anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Client deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost. Deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and provide opportunities to cross-sell other BB&T services. In addition, BB&T gathers a portion of its deposit base through wholesale funding products, which include negotiable certificates of deposit and Eurodollar deposits through the use of a Cayman branch facility. At December31, 2008, these sources of deposits represented approximately 15% of BB&Ts total deposits.
The following table provides information regarding the scheduled maturities of time deposits that are $100,000 and greater at December31, 2008: Table 7 Scheduled Maturities of Time Deposits $100,000 and Greater December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Maturity Schedule Three months or less $ 4,992 Over three through six months 2,486 Over six through twelve months 4,366 Over twelve months 4,429 Total $ 16,273 26 Table of Contents Borrowed Funds BB&Ts ability to borrow funds from nondeposit sources provides additional flexibility in meeting the liquidity needs of the Company. Short-term borrowings include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, short-term FHLB advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan depository note accounts and other short-term borrowings. See Note 9 Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Short-Term Borrowed Funds in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional disclosures related to these types of borrowings.
BB&T also utilizes longer-term borrowings when management determines that the pricing and maturity options available through these sources create cost-effective options for funding asset growth and satisfying capital needs. BB&Ts long-term borrowings include long-term FHLB advances to Branch Bank, senior and subordinated debt issued by BB&T Corporation and Branch Bank, junior subordinated debt underlying trust preferred securities and capital leases. See Note 10 Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional disclosures related to long-term borrowings.
Employees At December31, 2008, BB&T had approximately 29,600 full-time equivalent employees compared to approximately 29,400 full-time equivalent employees at December31, 2007.
Properties BB&T and its significant subsidiaries occupy headquarter offices that are either owned or operated under long-term leases. BB&T also owns free-standing operations centers, with its primary operations and information technology center located in Wilson, North Carolina. BB&T also owns or leases significant office space used as the Corporations headquarters in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At December31, 2008, Branch Bank operated 1,511 branch offices in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Florida, Indiana and Washington, D.C. BB&T also operates numerous insurance agencies and other businesses that occupy facilities. Office locations are either owned or leased. Management believes that the premises occupied by BB&T and its subsidiaries are well-located and suitably equipped to serve as financial services facilities. See Note 6 Premises and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional disclosures related to BB&Ts properties and other fixed assets.

Regulation of banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, BB&T and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to various other laws and regulations and supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of BB&T and its ability to make distributions to shareholders.
General As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under federal law, BB&T is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the BHCA) and the examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board). Branch Bank and BB&T FSB are collectively referred to herein as the Banks. Branch Bank, a state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. BB&T FSB, a federally chartered thrift institution, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Each of the Banks also is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC).
State and federal law govern the activities in which the Banks engage, the investments they make and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower, although BB&T FSB is entitled to federal preemption of various state laws. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect the Banks operations. The Banks also are affected by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the monetary supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.
In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities underwriting, dealing, brokerage, investment advisory and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, and supervision and examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (the FINRA), the NYSE Euronext, Inc. (the NYSE), and various state insurance and securities regulators.
The earnings of BB&Ts subsidiaries, and therefore the earnings of BB&T, are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in state and federal laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to above. Proposals to change the laws and regulations to which BB&T and its subsidiaries are subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on BB&T and its subsidiaries are impossible to determine with any certainty. The description herein summarizes the significant state and federal laws to which BB&T and the Banks currently are subject. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions are described, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions.
Financial Holding Company Regulation Under current federal law, a bank holding company, such as BB&T, may elect to become a financial holding company, which allows the holding company to offer customers virtually any type of service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking and activities closely related thereto, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. In order to become and maintain its status as a financial holding company, a financial holding company and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and have at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) rating. If the Federal Reserve Board determines that a financial holding company is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the company has a period of time to come into compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the 30 Table of Contents Federal Reserve Board can place any limitations on the financial holding company that it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the Federal Reserve Board determines that a financial holding company has not maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the company will not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the company will still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting merchant banking activities. BB&T became a financial holding company on June14, 2000, and currently satisfies the requirements to maintain its status as a financial holding company.
Most of the financial activities that are permissible for financial holding companies also are permissible for a financial subsidiary of one or more of the Banks, except for insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investments and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a financial holding company. In order for these financial activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a bank, federal law requires the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well-capitalized and well-managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that banks financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
Current federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation under which the Federal Reserve Board is the umbrella regulator for bank holding companies, but bank holding company affiliates are to be principally regulated by functional regulators such as the FDIC for state nonmember bank affiliates, the OTS for thrifts, the SEC for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in the bank without the bank being deemed a broker or a dealer in securities for purposes of functional regulation. Although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable areas.
Office of Thrift Supervision Regulation As a federally chartered thrift, BB&T FSB is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS. In connection with the charter conversion of BB&T FSB, Sheffield Financial, LLC and MidAmerica Gift Certificate Company, which were previously direct operating subsidiaries of BB&T, became divisions or subsidiaries of BB&T FSB. In addition, Liberty Mortgage Corporation, formerly a subsidiary of Branch Bank, was reorganized as a subsidiary of BB&T FSB. These organizational structure changes were made to optimize the operating efficiency of these divisions or subsidiaries and have no impact on BB&Ts reportable segments.
Acquisitions BB&T complies with numerous laws related to its acquisition activity. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank holding company or bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years; and subject to certain deposit market-share limitations. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law.
Other Safety and Soundness Regulations The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.
31 Table of Contents There also are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance fund in the event the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, under requirements of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit financial resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. In addition, the cross-guarantee provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the DIF as a result of the insolvency of commonly controlled insured depository institutions or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled insured depository institutions in danger of failure. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interests of the DIF. The FDICs claim for reimbursement under the cross guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and nonaffiliated holders of subordinated debt of the commonly controlled insured depository institution.
Federal and state banking regulators also have broad enforcement powers over the Banks, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a conservator (with the approval of the Governor in the case of a North Carolina state bank) in order to conserve the assets of any such institution for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks also has the authority to take possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears that such bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its business or has an impairment of its capital stock.
Payment of Dividends BB&T is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The majority of BB&Ts revenue is from dividends paid to BB&T by Branch Bank. The Banks are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends they can pay. In addition, BB&T and the Banks are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized elsewhere in this section. Federal banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (1)the organizations net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2)the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. North Carolina law states that, subject to certain capital requirements, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of North Carolina may declare a dividend of as much of that banks undivided profits as the directors deem expedient. BB&T does not expect that these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends.
Capital Each of the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OTS, has issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations they supervise, including bank holding companies and banks. Under the risk-based capital requirements, BB&T and the Banks are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) of 8%. At least half of the total capital must be composed of common shareholders equity excluding the over- or underfunded status of postretirement benefit obligations, unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale, unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges, net of deferred income taxes; plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities; less nonqualifying intangible assets net of applicable deferred income taxes and certain nonfinancial equity investments. This is called Tier 1 capital. The remainder may consist of qualifying subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses. This is called Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital combined are referred to as total regulatory capital.
32 Table of Contents The Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies that engage in trading activities to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to take into consideration market risks that may result from movements in market prices of covered trading positions in trading accounts, or from foreign exchange or commodity positions, whether or not in trading accounts, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Any capital required to be maintained under these provisions may consist of a new Tier 3 capital consisting of forms of short-term subordinated debt.
Each of the federal bank regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OTS, also has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations. These requirements provide that banking organizations that meet certain criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and good earnings, and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 3%. Institutions not meeting these criteria, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses, are expected to maintain a minimum Tier 1 capital to total adjusted average assets ratio at least 100 basis points above that stated minimum. Holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve Board also continues to consider a tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity.
In addition, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OTS all have adopted risk-based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as an institutions ability to manage these risks, as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institutions overall capital adequacy. The capital guidelines also provide that an institutions exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organizations capital adequacy. The agencies also require banks and bank holding companies to adjust their regulatory capital to take into consideration the risk associated with certain recourse obligations, direct credit subsidies, residual interest and other positions in securitized transactions that expose banking organizations to credit risk.
The ratios of Tier 1 capital, total capital to risk-adjusted assets, and leverage capital of BB&T, Branch Bank and BB&T FSB as of December31, 2008, are shown in the following table.
Table 8 Capital Adequacy Ratios of BB&T Corporation and Banks December 31, 2008 Regulatory Minimums Regulatory Minimums to be Well- Capitalized BB&T Branch Bank BB&T FSB Risk-based capital ratios: Tier 1 capital 4.0 % 6.0 % 12.3 % 10.8 % 14.4 % Total risk-based capital 8.0 10.0 17.4 13.6 15.7 Tier 1 leverage ratio 3.0 5.0 9.9 8.7 13.8 The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OTS, are required to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions and their bank holding companies that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five capital categories for insured depository institutions for this purpose: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. To be considered well-capitalized under these standards, an institution must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater; and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. BB&T, Branch Bank and BB&T FSB are all classified as well-capitalized. Federal law also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories, with progressively more severe restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions 33 Table of Contents according to the category in which an institution is placed. Failure to meet capital requirements also may cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital. Federal law also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards.
In addition to the prompt corrective action directives, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.
Deposit Insurance Assessments The deposits of the Banks are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the Reform Act). Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. On December16, 2008, the FDIC adopted a final rule increasing risk-based assessment rates uniformly by 7 basis points, on an annual basis, for the first quarter of 2009. Currently, banks pay between 5 and 43 basis points of their domestic deposits for FDIC insurance. Under the final rule, risk-based rates would range between 12 and 50 basis points (annualized) for the first quarter 2009 assessment, depending on the insured institutions risk category as described above. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. The FDIC has published guidelines under the Reform Act on the adjustment of assessment rates for certain institutions. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly. The Reform Act also provides for a one-time premium assessment credit for eligible insured depository institutions, including those institutions in existence and paying deposit insurance premiums on December31, 1996, or certain successors to any such institution. The assessment credit is determined based on the eligible institutions deposits at December31, 1996 and is applied automatically to reduce the institutions quarterly premium assessments to the maximum extent allowed, until the credit is exhausted. In addition, insured deposits have been required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO) to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation.
On February 27, 2009, the FDIC adopted an interim rule, with request for comment, which would institute a one-time special assessment of 20 cents per $100 of domestic deposits on FDIC insured institutions. If approved, BB&T estimates that the assessment would total approximately $175 million. The assessment would be payable on September 30, 2009.
Consumer Protection Laws In connection with their lending and leasing activities, each of the Banks is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts. BB&T FSB is entitled to federal preemption under the Home Owners Loan Act and OTS regulations of certain state laws.
Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institutions policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.
34 Table of Contents The CRA requires the Banks primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC for Branch Bank and the OTS for BB&T FSB, to assess the banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by each Bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve or Substantial Noncompliance. This assessment is reviewed for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a financial holding company, such as BB&T, also is assessed by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with any acquisition or merger application.
USA Patriot Act The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act includes the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the IMLAFA). The IMLAFA requires such financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the Treasury Department (the Secretary) broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions operations. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institutions anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. The Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations implementing the Patriot Act, which impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The obligations of financial institutions under the Patriot Act have increased, and may continue to increase. The increase in obligations of financial institutions has resulted in increased costs for BB&T, which may continue to rise, and also may subject BB&T to additional liability. As noted above, enforcement and compliance-related activities by government agencies has increased. Compliance with the Patriot Act, and in particular the IMLAFA, are among the areas receiving focus from bank regulators conducting examinations and this can be expected to continue.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting for companies, such as BB&T, with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established: (1)new requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (2)new certification responsibilities for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer with respect to the Companys financial statements; (3)new standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (4)increased disclosure and reporting obligations for reporting companies and their directors and executive officers; and (5)new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the federal securities laws.
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 In response to recent unprecedented market turmoil, the EESA was enacted on October3, 2008. EESA authorizes the Secretary to purchase or guarantee up to $700 billion in troubled assets from financial institutions under the TARP. Pursuant to authority granted under EESA, the Secretary has created the TARP CPP under which the Treasury Department will invest up to $250 billion in senior preferred stock of U.S. banks and savings associations or their holding companies. Qualifying financial institutions may issue senior preferred stock with a value equal to not less than 1% of risk-weighted assets and not more than the lesser of $25 billion or 3% of risk-weighted assets.
Institutions participating in the TARP or CPP are required to issue warrants for common or preferred stock or senior debt to the Secretary. If an institution participates in the CPP or if the Secretary acquires a meaningful equity or debt position in the institution as a result of TARP participation, the institution is required to meet certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance, including a prohibition against incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks, recovery of bonuses paid to senior executives based on materially inaccurate earnings or other statements and a prohibition against agreements for the payment of golden parachutes. Institutions that sell more than $300 million in assets under TARP auctions or participate in the CPP will not be entitled to a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $500,000 paid to its chief executive or 35 Table of Contents chief financial official or any of its other three most highly compensated officers. In addition, any severance paid to such officers for involuntary termination or termination in connection with a bankruptcy or receivership will be subject to the golden parachute rules under the Internal Revenue Code. Additional standards with respect to executive compensation and corporate governance for institutions that have participated or will participate in the TARP (including the CPP) were enacted as part of the ARRA, described below.
CPP Participation On November14, 2008, BB&T entered into a Letter Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the Treasury Department under the CPP, pursuant to which BB&T agreed to issue 3,133.64 shares of BB&Ts Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the Series C Preferred Stock), having a liquidation amount per share equal to $1 million, for a total price of $3.1 billion. The Series C Preferred Stock is to pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5%per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of 9%per year. BB&T may not redeem the Series C Preferred Stock during the first three years except with the proceeds from a qualified equity offering (as defined in BB&Ts articles of incorporation). However, under the ARRA, BB&T may redeem the Series C Preferred Stock without a qualified equity offering, subject to the approval of its primary federal regulator. After three years, BB&T may, at its option, redeem the Series C Preferred Stock at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series C Preferred Stock is generally non-voting, but does have the right to vote as a class on the issuance of any preferred stock ranking senior, any change in its terms or any merger, exchange or similar transaction that would adversely affect its rights. The holder(s) of Series C Preferred Stock also have the right to elect two directors if dividends have not been paid for six periods.
As part of its purchase of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Treasury Department received a warrant (the Warrant) to purchase 13.9million shares of BB&Ts common stock at an initial per share exercise price of $33.81. The Warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of BB&Ts common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions, such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of BB&Ts common stock, and upon certain issuances of BB&Ts common stock at or below a specified price relative to the initial exercise price. The Warrant expires ten years from the issuance date. If, on or prior to December31, 2009, BB&T receives aggregate gross cash proceeds of not less than $3.1 billion from qualified equity offerings announced after October13, 2008, the number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Treasury Departments exercise of the Warrant will be reduced by one-half of the original number of shares, taking into account all adjustments, underlying the Warrant. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Treasury Department has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant. Under the ARRA, the Warrant would be liquidated upon the redemption by BB&T of the Series C Preferred Stock.
Both the Series C Preferred Stock and the Warrant will be accounted for as components of Tier 1 capital.
Prior to November14, 2011, unless BB&T has redeemed the Series C Preferred Stock or the Treasury Department has transferred the Series C Preferred Stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury Department will be required for BB&T to (1)declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on its common stock (other than regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than $0.47 per share of common stock) or (2)redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of its common stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the Purchase Agreement.
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 The ARRA was enacted on February17, 2009. The ARRA includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure, energy, health, and education needs. In addition, the ARRA imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate governance obligations on all current and future TARP recipients, including BB&T, until the institution has redeemed the preferred stock, which TARP recipients are now permitted to do under the ARRA without regard to the three year holding period and without the need to raise new capital, subject to approval of its primary federal regulator. The executive compensation restrictions under the ARRA (described below) are more stringent than those currently in effect under the CPP, 36 Table of Contents but it is yet unclear how these executive compensation standards will relate to the similar standards recently announced by the Treasury Department, or whether the standards will be considered effective immediately or only after implementing regulations are issued by the Treasury Department.
The ARRA amends Section111 of the EESA to require the Secretary to adopt additional standards with respect to executive compensation and corporate governance for TARP recipients (including BB&T). The standards required to be established by the Secretary include, in part, (1)prohibitions on making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and the next 5 most highly-compensated employees during such time as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding (the Restricted Period), (2)prohibitions on paying or accruing bonuses or other incentive awards for certain senior executive officers and employees, except for awards of long-term restricted stock with a value equal to no greater than 1/3 of the subject employees annual compensation that do not fully vest during the Restricted Period or unless such compensation is pursuant to a valid written employment contract prior to February11, 2009, (3)requirements that TARP CPP participants provide for the recovery of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to senior executive officers and the next 20 most highly-compensated employees based on statements of earnings, revenues, gains or other criteria later found to be materially inaccurate, with the Secretary having authority to negotiate for reimbursement, and (4)a review by the Secretary of all bonuses and other compensation paid by TARP participants to senior executive employees and the next 20 most highly-compensated employees before the date of enactment of the ARRA to determine whether such payments were inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.
The ARRA also sets forth additional corporate governance obligations for TARP recipients, including requirements for the Secretary to establish standards that provide for semi-annual meetings of compensation committees of the board of directors to discuss and evaluate employee compensation plans in light of an assessment of any risk posed from such compensation plans. TARP recipients are further required by the ARRA to have in place company-wide policies regarding excessive or luxury expenditures, permit non-binding shareholder say-on-pay proposals to be included in proxy materials, as well as require written certifications by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer with respect to compliance. The Secretary is required to promulgate regulations to implement the executive compensation and certain corporate governance provisions detailed in the ARRA.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Pursuant to the EESA, the maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor has been increased from $100,000 to $250,000 until December31, 2009. Additionally, on October14, 2008, after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, the Secretary of the Treasury signed the systemic risk exception to the FDIC Act, enabling the FDIC to establish its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). Under the transaction account guarantee program of the TLGP, the FDIC will fully guarantee, until the end of 2009, all non-interest-bearing transaction accounts, including NOW accounts with interest rates of 0.5 percent or less and IOLTAs (lawyer trust accounts). The TLGP also guarantees all senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions or their qualified holding companies issued between October14, 2008 and June30, 2009 with a stated maturity greater than 30 days. All eligible institutions were permitted to participate in both of the components of the TLGP without cost for the first 30 days of the program. Following the initial 30 day grace period, institutions were assessed at the rate of ten basis points for transaction account balances in excess of $250,000 for the transaction account guarantee program and at the rate of either 50, 75, or 100 basis points of the amount of debt issued, depending on the maturity date of the guaranteed debt, for the debt guarantee program. Institutions were required to opt-out of the TLGP if they did not wish to participate. BB&T did not choose to opt out of either the transaction account guarantee program or debt guarantee program components of the TGLP.
Future Laws, Regulations and Governmental Programs Various laws, regulations and governmental programs affecting financial institutions and the financial industry are from time to time introduced in Congress or otherwise promulgated by regulatory agencies. Such measures may change the operating environment of BB&T and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable 37 Table of Contents ways. With the recent enactments of the EESA and the ARRA, the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions is very unpredictable at this time.
Specifically, on February10, 2009, the Treasury Department announced the Financial Stability Plan (the Plan), representing a set of measures intended to restore confidence in the strength of U.S. financial institutions and restart the flow of credit to households and businesses. Core elements of the Plan include, in part (1)a mandatory stress test requirement for banking institutions, such as BB&T, with assets in excess of $100 billion, which would require a comprehensive assessment of whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue lending and absorb potential losses and increased disclosure of risk exposure on the balance sheet of such banking institutions, (2)additional required disclosures from participants in the Plan related to the impact of assistance received under the Plan on the institutions lending practices, and (3)more robust limitations on dividend, stock repurchase, acquisition, and executive compensation activities. On February18, 2009 the Treasury Department outlined the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, which includes measures that could impact BB&T, including measures to (1)implement a comprehensive homeowner stability initiative that incentivizes financial institutions to reduce homeowners monthly mortgage payments, (2)develop clear and consistent guidelines for loan modifications that participants will be obligated to use, and (3)authorize judicial modifications of home mortgages in personal bankruptcy cases, which modifications must be accepted by the loan servicer or lender. The foregoing programs and actions remain subject to further clarification, and full implementation, and their full impact upon BB&T remains unpredictable at this time.
Other Regulatory Matters BB&T and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, the FINRA, the NYSE and various state insurance and securities regulators. BB&T and its subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state insurance commissions and state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning their business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.
Corporate Governance Information with respect to BB&Ts corporate governance policies and principles is presented on BB&Ts web site, www.BBT.com , and includes:  BB&Ts Corporate Governance Guidelines  BB&Ts Corporate Board of Directors  Committees of the Corporate Board of Directors and Committee Charters  BB&Ts Codes of Ethics for Directors, Senior Financial Officers and Employees  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Certifications  BB&Ts Executive Officers  BB&Ts Policy and Procedures for Accounting and Legal Complaints BB&T intends to disclose any substantive amendments or waivers to the Code of Ethics for Directors or Senior Financial Officers on our web site at www.BBT.com/Investor .
NYSE Certification The annual certification of BB&Ts Chief Executive Officer required to be furnished to the NYSE pursuant to Section303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual was previously filed with the NYSE on May19, 2008.
38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008, and related financial information, are presented in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of BB&Ts 2008 performance.
Reclassifications In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the 2008 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders equity or net income.
Mergers and Acquisitions Completed During 2008 On December12, 2008, BB&T announced the acquisition of all the deposits of Haven Trust Bank (Haven Trust) of Duluth, Georgia through an agreement with the FDIC. Haven Trust operated four branches with approximately $506 million in deposits. In addition to the acquisition noted above, BB&T acquired eleven insurance agencies and one nonbank financial services company during 2008. All of the acquisitions during 2008 were immaterial in relation to the consolidated results of BB&T. See Note 2 Business Combinations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding mergers and acquisitions.
Critical Accounting Policies The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. BB&Ts financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in BB&Ts consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. The more critical accounting and reporting policies include BB&Ts accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, determining fair value of financial instruments, intangible assets and other purchase accounting related adjustments associated with mergers and acquisitions, costs and benefit obligations associated with BB&Ts pension and postretirement benefit plans, and income taxes. Understanding BB&Ts accounting policies is fundamental to understanding BB&Ts consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, BB&Ts significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following is a summary of BB&Ts critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. These critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of BB&Ts Board of Directors on a periodic basis.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments It is the policy of BB&T to maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments that equal managements best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. Estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan and lease administration, the results of regulatory examinations, and changes in the size, composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. Also included in managements estimates for loan and lease losses are considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of 39 Table of Contents which are uncertain. These events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which BB&T conducts business. The methodology used to determine an estimate for the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is inherently similar to the methodology used in calculating the allowance for loans and leases adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at the time of funding. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in the Overview and Description of BusinessAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant portion of BB&Ts assets and certain liabilities are financial instruments carried at fair value. This includes securities available for sale, trading securities, derivatives, certain loans held for sale, residential mortgage servicing rights, certain short-term borrowings and venture capital investments. At December31, 2008, the percentage of total assets and total liabilities measured at fair value was 24.3% and less than 1%, respectively. The vast majority of assets and liabilities carried at fair value are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. At December31, 2008, 4.6% of assets measured at fair value were based on significant unobservable inputs. This is less than 1% of BB&Ts total assets. See Note 18 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.
Securities The fair values for available-for-sale and trading securities are generally based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments. These values take into account recent market activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate, spread and prepayment information. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain trading securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had approximately $1.1 billion of available-for-sale and trading securities, which is less than 1% of total assets, valued using unobservable inputs. These securities were primarily non-agency mortgage-backed securities.
Mortgage Servicing Rights BB&T has a significant mortgage loan servicing portfolio and related mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). BB&T has two classes of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risk: residential and commercial. Residential MSRs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income each period. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value, due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions, of its residential MSRs. MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, BB&T estimates the fair value of residential MSRs using an option adjusted spread (OAS) valuation model to project MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. BB&T reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the MSR asset. When available, fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to observable market data and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, MSRs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value of MSRs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of MSRs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of MSRs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. Commercial MSRs are carried at lower of cost or market and amortized over the estimated period that servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. The amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is updated based on actual 40 Table of Contents results and updated projections. Please refer to Note 8 Loan Servicing in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in managements assumptions would have on the fair value of MSRs.
Loans Held for Sale BB&T originates certain mortgage loans to be sold to investors. The majority of these loans are carried at fair value based on the Fair Value Option. For these loans, the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income while mortgage loan origination costs for loans held for sale for which the Corporation elected the Fair Value Option are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. The changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans.
Derivatives BB&T uses derivatives to manage various financial risks. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. BB&T mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to BB&T when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that BB&T does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee.
Venture Capital Investments BB&T has venture capital investments that are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in other noninterest income each period. In many cases there are no observable market values for these investments and therefore management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating performance of the company to multiples in the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant judgment and actual values in a sale could differ materially from those estimated. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had $183 million of venture capital investments, which is less than 1% of total assets.
Intangible Assets BB&Ts growth in business, profitability and market share over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions. BB&Ts mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, BB&T is required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which often involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. The amortization of identified intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. These estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facility dispositions and employee severance considerations, among other acquisition-related items. In addition, purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill. Please refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of BB&Ts impairment testing process. The major assumptions used in the impairment testing process include the estimated future cash flows of each business unit and discount rates. Discount rates are unique to each business unit and are based upon the cost of capital specific to the industry in which the business unit operates. Management has evaluated the effect of lowering the estimated future cash flows or increasing the discount rate for each business unit by 10% and determined that no impairment of goodwill would have been recognized under this evaluation. However, as a result of the market disruption and the decline in market capitalization, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value of several reporting units continues to narrow. A continuing period of market disruption, or further market deterioration, may result in impairment of goodwill in the future.
41 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. The calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. Actuarial valuations and assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to published high-quality bond indices, as well as certain hypothetical spot-rate yield curves. These yield curves were constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected as of the plans measurement date and are represented by a series of annualized, individual discount rates with durations ranging from six months to thirty years. Each discount rate in the curve was derived from an equal weighting of the double A or higher bond universe, apportioned into distinct maturity groups. For durations where no bond maturities were available, the discount rates for these maturities were extrapolated based on historical relationships from observable data in similar markets. These indices and hypothetical curves give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices and curves do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely. For this reason, we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan, such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations, when setting the discount rate. Please refer to Note 14 Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to BB&Ts benefit plans, including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations.
Income Taxes The calculation of BB&Ts income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. As part of the Companys analysis and implementation of business strategies, consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any tax position under evaluation. For tax positions that are uncertain in nature, management determines whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For tax positions that meet this threshold, management then estimates the amount of the tax benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Companys overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary.
Analysis of Financial Condition A summary of the more significant fluctuations in balance sheet accounts is presented below.
For the year ended December31, 2008, BB&Ts average assets totaled $136.9 billion, an increase of $10.5 billion, or 8.3%, compared to the 2007 average of $126.4 billion, primarily reflecting growth in average loans and leases and investment securities. Average loans and leases for 2008 were up $7.2 billion, or 8.2%, from 2007 and average investment securities increased $1.2 billion, or 5.1%, compared to 2007. The growth in average loans and leases was led by growth in average commercial loans and leases, which increased $5.1 billion, or 12.0%; average mortgage loans, which increased $1.1 billion, or 6.2%; and growth in average loans originated by BB&Ts specialized lending subsidiaries, which increased $445 million, or 8.6%. Total earning assets averaged $120.9 billion in 2008, an increase of $8.5 billion, or 7.6%, compared to 2007. These averages and growth rates include the effects of acquisitions.
BB&Ts average deposits totaled $88.8 billion, reflecting growth of $5.3 billion, or 6.4%, compared to 2007. The categories of deposits with the highest growth rates were other interest-bearing deposits, which increased $2.1 billion, or 26.7%, and other client deposits, which increased $2.4 billion, or 7.0%.
Short-term borrowings include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, short-term bank notes, treasury tax and loan deposit notes payable and other short-term borrowings. Average short-term borrowings totaled $10.6 billion for the year ended December31, 2008, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 13.5%, from the 2007 average. BB&T also has used long-term debt for a significant portion of its funding needs. Long-term debt includes Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, other secured borrowings by Branch Bank, capital securities issued by unconsolidated trusts and senior and subordinated debt issued by the Corporation and Branch Bank. Average long-term debt totaled $19.8 billion for the year ended December31, 2008, up $1.8 billion, or 9.9%, compared to 2007.
42 Table of Contents The compound annual rate of growth in average total assets for the five-year period ended December31, 2008, was 9.9%. Over the same five-year period, average loans and leases increased at a compound annual rate of 10.5%, average securities increased at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, and average deposits grew at a compound annual rate of 9.3%. These balance sheet growth rates include the effect of acquisitions, as well as internal growth.

Securities The securities portfolio provides earnings and liquidity, and is managed as part of the overall asset and liability management process to optimize net interest income and reduce exposure to interest rate risk. Management has historically emphasized investments with duration of five years or less to provide flexibility in managing the balance sheet in changing interest rate environments. Total securities increased 41.8% from year-end 2007 to year-end 2008, to a total of $33.2 billion at December31, 2008. The growth in the securities portfolio reflects the initial deployment of the capital invested by the Treasury Department in connection with the CPP. The purchase of additional securities at year-end 2008 was the most efficient and effective means of deploying the capital investment by the Treasury Department. It is anticipated that cash flows from pay downs and maturities from the securities portfolio will be reinvested into loans during 2009, and the overall size of the securities portfolio will eventually decline to a more traditional level.
As of December31, 2008, the total securities portfolio included $376 million in trading securities and $32.8 billion of available-for-sale securities. The available-for-sale portfolio comprised 98.9% of total securities at December31, 2008. Management believes that the high concentration of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio allows flexibility in the management of the overall investment portfolio, consistent with the objectives of optimizing profitability, mitigating interest rate risk, supporting capital and providing liquidity.
The following table provides information regarding the composition of BB&Ts securities portfolio for the years presented: Table 9 Composition of Securities Portfolio December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Trading securities: $ 376 $ 1,009 $ 2,147 Securities available for sale: U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSE) 1,333 9,807 9,119 Mortgage-backed securities issued by GSE 27,430 8,221 8,297 States and political subdivisions 2,077 1,392 571 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities 1,098 1,720 1,571 Equity and other securities 905 1,279 1,163 Total securities available for sale 32,843 22,419 20,721 Total securities $ 33,219 $ 23,428 $ 22,868 At December31, 2008, trading securities reflected on BB&Ts consolidated balance sheet totaled $376 million compared to $1.0 billion at December31, 2007. The decline in the trading portfolio was largely the result of a reduction in Scott& Stringfellows trading inventory primarily due to managements decision to reduce risk associated with trading activities.
43 Table of Contents The available-for-sale securities portfolio is primarily composed of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities. Mortgage-backed securities comprised 83.5% of the total available-for-sale securities portfolio at year-end 2008. The duration of the mortgage-backed securities was 1.60 years at December31, 2008 compared to 2.91 years at December31, 2007. The duration of the entire available-for-sale portfolio at December31, 2008 was 2.77 years compared to 2.43 years at December31, 2007.
The market value of the available-for-sale portfolio at year-end 2008 was $517 million lower than the amortized cost of these securities. At December31, 2008, BB&Ts available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized losses, net of deferred income taxes, of $324 million, which are reported as a component of shareholders equity. At December31, 2007, the available-for-sale portfolio had net unrealized losses of $28 million, net of deferred income taxes. The decline in the fair value of the securities available-for-sale portfolio during 2008 was largely a result of declines in the value of non-agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities, as demand for securities in these asset classes has waned due to investor concerns about real estate related assets and the overall state of the economy. Declines in the values of these portfolios were partially offset by increases in the value of government sponsored entity securities.
During the year ended December31, 2008, BB&T sold approximately $21.0 billion of available-for-sale securities and realized net gains totaling $211 million. In addition, BB&T periodically evaluates available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. Based on its evaluations during 2008, BB&T recorded $104 million of other-than-temporary impairments related to certain debt and equity securities. No other-than-temporary impairments were recorded during 2007 and 2006.
On December31, 2008, BB&T also held certain investment securities having continuous unrealized loss positions for more than 12 months. As of December31, 2008, the unrealized losses on these securities totaled $412 million. Substantially all of these losses were in non-agency mortgage-backed and municipal securities. At December31, 2008, all of the available-for-sale debt securities with the exception of four non-agency mortgage-backed securities were investment grade. During the fourth quarter of 2008, four non-agency mortgage-backed securities, with a book value of approximately $293 million, were downgraded below investment grade. BB&T evaluated all of its non-agency mortgage-backed securities based on the underlying collateral as well as capital structure. BB&T holds the senior position on all of the non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses for all of the securities having continuous unrealized loss positions for more than 12 months are the result of changes in market interest rates and liquidity. Based on the evaluation on December31, 2008, there were no credit losses evident from these securities. At December31, 2008, BB&T had the ability and intent to retain these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover all unrealized losses.
44 Table of Contents The following table presents BB&Ts securities portfolio at December31, 2008, segregated by major category with ranges of maturities and average yields disclosed.
Table 10 Securities December31,2008 FairValue Weighted AverageYield(1) (Dollars in millions) U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSE): Within one year $ 258 4.12 % One to five years 998 4.12 Five to ten years 56 5.18 After ten years 21 5.87 Total 1,333 4.19 Mortgage-backed securities issued by GSE (2): One to five years 126 3.80 Five to ten years 1,053 4.38 After ten years 26,251 4.85 Total 27,430 4.83 Obligations of states and political subdivisions: Within one year 106 6.84 One to five years 114 6.88 Five to ten years 72 7.15 After ten years 1,785 6.65 Total 2,077 6.68 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities (2): Five to ten years 70 5.33 After ten years 1,028 5.75 Total 1,098 5.73 Other securities: Within one year 3 3.63 One to five years 101 5.03 Five to ten years 111 7.89 After ten years 8 2.61 Total 223 6.29 Trading securities and securities with no stated maturity (3) 1,058 1.82 Total securities (4) $ 33,219 4.89 (1) Yields on tax-exempt securities are calculated on a taxable-equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%. Yields for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the amortized cost of the securities.
(2) For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the weighted average contractual maturities of underlying collateral.
(3) Trading securities and securities with no stated maturity include equity investments that totaled $682 million and trading securities that totaled $376 million.
(4) Includes securities available-for-sale and trading securities of $32.8 billion and $376 million, respectively.
The fully taxable equivalent (FTE) yield on the total securities portfolio was 5.05% for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007. The FTE yield remained stable despite general declines in interest rates due to 45 Table of Contents changes in the overall composition of the securities portfolio with a larger concentration of higher-yielding mortgage-backed and municipal securities. The yield on mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored entities decreased from 5.15% to 4.94% and the FTE yield on state and municipal securities decreased from 6.65% last year to 6.33% in the current year, while the yield on U.S. government-sponsored entity securities increased from 4.53% in 2007 to 4.86% in 2008. The yield on non-agency mortgage-backed securities increased from 5.78% during 2007 to 5.81% in 2008.
Loans and Leases BB&T emphasizes commercial lending to small and medium-sized businesses, consumer lending, mortgage lending and specialized lending with an overall goal of maximizing the profitability of the loan portfolio while maintaining strong asset quality. The various categories of loan products offered by BB&T are discussed under Lending Activities in the Overview and Description of Business section herein. BB&T is a full-service lender with approximately one-half of its loan portfolio to businesses and one-half to individual consumers. Average commercial loans, including lease receivables, comprised 50.0% of the loan portfolio during 2008, compared to 48.3% in 2007. Average direct retail loans comprised 16.4% of average loans in 2008, compared to 17.6% in 2007. Average sales finance loans comprised 6.5% of average loans in 2008, compared to 6.7% in 2007. Average revolving credit loans comprised 1.7% of average loans in 2008 and 2007. Average mortgage loans comprised 19.5% of average total loans for 2008, compared to 19.9% a year ago. Average loans originated by BB&Ts specialized lending subsidiaries represented 5.9% of average total loans in 2008 compared to 5.8% in the prior year.
BB&Ts loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, increased $6.3 billion, or 7.0%, compared to year-end 2007. Average total loans and leases for 2008 increased $7.2 billion, or 8.2%, compared to 2007. The growth in the loan portfolio was primarily a result of strong internal growth in the commercial and industrial lending portfolio, as well as growth in the mortgage and specialized lending portfolios. The growth in average loans during 2008, includes the impact of the acquisition of Coastal Financial Corporation (Coastal), which was acquired during 2007.
Average commercial loans and leases increased $5.1 billion, or 12.0%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. Overall, the commercial loan and lease portfolio showed strong growth during 2008. The mix of the commercial loan portfolio has shifted somewhat, as commercial real estate lending has slowed due to a slower real estate market and managements efforts to reduce exposure to the real estate market. This has been offset by an increased focus on commercial and industrial loans. BB&T experienced stronger trends in the fourth quarter of 2008 both in commercial and industrial lending and income producing commercial real estate lending primarily due to challenges facing many in-market competitors that has allowed BB&T to attract new clients.
The pace of growth in the direct retail loan portfolio slowed further in 2008, due to a difficult residential real estate market, which decreased demand for home equity loan products. Sales finance loans and revolving credit reflected solid growth rates of 5.3% and 14.0%, respectively, during 2008. BB&T concentrates its efforts on the highest quality borrowers in both of these product markets. Sales finance loans were negatively affected by weak auto sales; however BB&T has been gaining market share in this portfolio as many competitors have withdrawn from indirect automobile lending in our footprint.
Average mortgage loans increased $1.1 billion, or 6.2%, compared to 2007. Management views mortgage loans as an integral part of BB&Ts relationship-based credit culture. BB&T is a large originator of residential mortgage loans, with 2008 originations of $16.4 billion. The vast majority of mortgage loans originated during 2008 were conforming mortgage loans that were either sold in the secondary market or held in the loans held for sale portfolio at year-end. Loans held for sale, which is almost entirely comprised of government-conforming mortgage loans increased 82.8% compared to year-end 2007 as refinance activity significantly increased late in the fourth quarter due to the historically low loan rates for mortgages. At December31, 2008, BB&T was servicing $40.7 billion in residential mortgages owned by third parties and $19.0 billion of mortgage loans owned by BB&T, including $18.4 billion classified as mortgage loans and $573 million classified as securities available for sale.
Average loans originated by BB&Ts specialized lending subsidiaries increased $445 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2007. The growth in the specialized lending portfolio was driven by strong internal loan growth in 46 Table of Contents automobile lending, as many competitors exited this business during 2008. Additionally, healthy growth trends were evident in premium finance and equipment finance during the fourth quarter.
The average annualized FTE yield for 2008 for the total loan portfolio was 6.35% compared to 7.67% for the prior year. The 132 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans resulted primarily from the repricing of variable rate loans and maturing loans with higher yields that were replaced with lower-yielding loans and leases. The prime rate, which is the basis for pricing many commercial and consumer loans, declined 400 basis points during 2008 to 3.25% at year-end as the Federal Reserve Board lowered rates seven times during 2008 in response to the economic recession, challenges in the residential real estate markets, and disruptions in other financial markets. The average prime rate in effect during 2008 and 2007 was 5.09% and 8.05%, respectively.
Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management BB&T has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:  limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend;  establishing a process for credit approval accountability;  careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;  ongoing servicing of individual loans and lending relationships;  continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and  periodically reevaluating the banks strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.
BB&Ts lending strategy, which focuses on relationship-based lending within our markets and smaller individual loan balances, continues to produce credit quality that is better than its peer group of financial institutions. As measured by relative levels of nonperforming assets and net charge-offs, BB&Ts asset quality has remained significantly better than published industry averages.

(2) Excludes mortgage loans guaranteed by GNMA that BB&T does not have the obligation to repurchase.
During 2008, BB&Ts credit quality declined as a result of a very challenging economic environment. Nonperforming assets and credit losses increased further during the year as a result of the distressed residential real estate market and economic recession. Nonperforming assets increased from .52% of total assets at December31, 2007 to 1.34% at year-end 2008. Net charge-offs for 2008 were .89% of average loans and leases and reflected an increase of 51 basis points from the .38% level recorded during 2007. The increases in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs were driven by continued deterioration in residential real estate markets and the overall economy with the largest concentration of credit issues occurring in Georgia, Florida and metro Washington, D.C. If the economy continues to deteriorate as is currently forecasted, management anticipates that net charge-offs and nonperforming assets will continue to increase into 2009.

49 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments The allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments compose BB&Ts allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses totaled $1.6 billion at December31, 2008, an increase of 58.3% compared to $1.0 billion at the end of 2007. The allowance for loan and lease losses, as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment, was 1.62% at December31, 2008, compared to 1.10% at year-end 2007. The allowance for credit losses increased by $592 million during 2008, primarily as a result of higher loss rates for residential real estate related lending, and their effect on the overall allowance model. The increase of $592 million included an increase of $570 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and $22 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. These increases resulted from increased migration of loans and lending commitments to higher risk grades, with the most significant increases occurring in the single family residential real estate acquisition, development and construction loan portfolio. Please refer to Note 5 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures.
Information relevant to BB&Ts allowance for loan and lease losses for the last five years is presented in the following table. The table is presented using regulatory classifications.

Deposits and Other Borrowings Client deposits generated through the BB&T banking network are the largest source of funds used to support asset growth. Total deposits at December31, 2008, were $98.6 billion, an increase of $11.8 billion, or 13.7%, compared to year-end 2007. The increase in deposits during 2008 was driven by a $5.0 billion, or 49.9%, increase in other interest-bearing deposits and a $3.9 billion, or 11.0%, increase in other client deposits, which 50 Table of Contents include money rate savings accounts, investor deposit accounts, savings accounts, individual retirement accounts and other time deposits. Interest checking accounts also increased by $1.4 billion from the prior year and client certificates of deposit (CDs) increased by $965 million. For the year ended December31, 2008, total deposits averaged $88.8 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion, or 6.4%, compared to 2007. The increase in average deposits was primarily the result of a $2.4 billion, or 7.0%, increase in average other client deposits, and a $2.1 billion, or 26.7%, increase in average other interest-bearing deposits. The overall increase in year-end deposits included the impact of the acquisition of $506 million in deposits from Haven Trust, which was completed late in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in average deposits also included the impact of the acquisition of Coastal which was completed during 2007.
Average other client deposits represent the largest component of BB&Ts deposits and composed 41.3% of total average deposits for 2008, compared to 41.0% during 2007. CDs are the second largest source and composed 30.3% of total average deposits for 2008 compared to 31.2% for 2007. The remainder of client deposits consists of noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-checking accounts, which comprised 17.4% of total average deposits in the current year, compared to 18.5%, for last year. BB&T also gathers other interest-bearing deposits through wholesale funding products, which include negotiable certificates of deposit and Eurodollar deposits. Average other interest-bearing deposits represented 11.0% of total average deposits for 2008, as compared to 9.3% for 2007.
BB&T experienced solid deposit growth during 2008, which accelerated during the second half of the year, as BB&T gained many new client relationships from competitors. The growth in deposits during 2008 included strong increases in corporate banking relationships and investor deposit accounts, as BB&T focused its efforts on these segments. In addition, BB&T was able to achieve growth in client CDs, even as rates declined to historical lows throughout the year. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined slightly in 2008, as business clients continued to minimize their balances in noninterest-bearing accounts. The decline in business noninterest-bearing balances was offset by growth in balances from consumer clients. The growth in other interest-bearing deposits is largely driven by the relative cost of these funding sources compared to other short-term and long-term borrowings.
The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits dropped to 2.50% during 2008, from 3.73% in 2007. The average cost for interest-bearing deposits declined during 2008 as management was able to lower rates in response to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. The average rates paid on the various categories of interest-bearing deposits also decreased as follows: CDs decreased to 3.66% in the current year from 4.61% in 2007; other client deposits decreased to 1.67% in the current year from 2.82% in 2007; interest checking decreased to 1.19% in 2008 from 2.31% in 2007; and other interest-bearing deposits decreased to 2.71% in 2008 from 5.15% in 2007.
BB&T also uses various types of short-term borrowings in meeting funding needs. While client deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. Short-term borrowings comprised 7.7% of total funding needs on average in 2008 as compared to 7.4% in 2007. See Note 9 Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Short-Term Borrowed Funds in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further disclosure. The types of short-term borrowings used by the Corporation include Federal funds purchased, which comprised 5.4% of total short-term borrowings, and securities sold under repurchase agreements, which comprised 27.2% of short-term borrowings at year-end 2008. Master notes, which are short-term borrowings issued to BB&Ts clients, represented 15.8% of total short-term borrowings at December31, 2008. U.S. Treasury tax and loan deposit notes, borrowings under the treasury auction facility and short-term bank notes are also used to meet short-term funding needs and comprised the remaining 51.6% of these types of funding sources as of December31, 2008. Short-term borrowings at the end of 2008 were $10.8 billion, an increase of $154 million, or 1.4% compared to year-end 2007. Average short-term borrowings totaled $10.6 billion during 2008 compared to $9.3 billion last year, an increase of 13.5%. The rates paid on average short-term borrowings declined from 4.55% in 2007 to 2.44% during 2008. The decrease in the cost of short-term borrowings primarily resulted from a lower average Federal funds rate in effect during 2008 compared to 2007. At December31, 2008, the targeted Federal funds rate was a range of zero percent to 51 Table of Contents .25%. The following table summarizes certain pertinent information for the past three years with respect to BB&Ts short-term borrowings: Table 14 Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Short-Term Borrowed Funds As of /For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 2,929 $ 2,776 $ 3,080 Balance outstanding at end of year 2,929 2,530 2,090 Average outstanding during the year 2,314 2,160 2,608 Average interest rate during the year 2.40 % 4.39 % 4.35 % Average interest rate at end of year 1.41 3.18 4.24 Federal Funds Purchased and Short-term Borrowed Funds Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 13,346 $ 9,148 $ 6,036 Balance outstanding at end of year 7,859 8,104 5,997 Average outstanding during the year 8,266 7,165 4,398 Average interest rate during the year 2.17 % 4.39 % 4.27 % Average interest rate at end of year .67 3.79 4.83 BB&T also uses long-term debt to provide both funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. Long-term debt comprised 14.5% of total funding needs on average during 2008 and 14.3% in 2007. See Note 10 Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further disclosure. Long-term debt at December31, 2008, totaled $18.0 billion, a decrease of $661 million, or 3.5%, from year-end 2007. For the year ended December31, 2008, average long-term debt increased $1.8 billion, or 9.9%, compared to the average for 2007. BB&Ts long-term debt consists primarily of FHLB advances, which composed 54.6% of total outstanding long-term debt at December31, 2008, subordinated notes of BB&T Corporation, which composed 17.2% of the year-end balance, and junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts issued by the Corporation, which composed 13.0% of total outstanding long-term debt at December31, 2008. The remaining long-term debt primarily consists of both unsecured senior and subordinated borrowings by Branch Bank. FHLB advances are cost-effective long-term funding sources that provide BB&T with the flexibility to structure the debt in a manner that aids in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity. The average rate paid on long-term debt decreased from 5.46% during 2007 to 4.25% during 2008 primarily because BB&T has issued floating rate instruments or elected to swap a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt to floating rates.
During the fourth quarter of 2008, BB&T received notice that its $4 billion privately financed debt scheduled to mature in 2010 would be called effective October14, 2008. The financing was called by BB&Ts counterparty because it was no longer profitable to the counterparty due to changes in interest rates. This decline was partially offset by increases in FHLB advances, which were used due to the more competitive rates obtained compared to other financing options. In addition, BB&T and Branch Bank issued new long-term debt during the third quarter of 2008 that provides additional regulatory capital. In September 2008, BB&T Capital Trust V (BBTCT V) issued $450 million of Capital Securities, with a fixed interest rate of 8.95% through September15, 2063 and a floating rate, if extended, through September15, 2068. BBTCT V, a statutory business trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware, was formed by BB&T for the sole purpose of issuing the Capital Securities and investing the proceeds thereof in Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by BB&T. BB&T has made guarantees which, taken collectively, fully, irrevocably, and unconditionally guarantee, on a subordinated basis, all of BBTCT Vs obligations under the Trust and Capital Securities. BBTCT Vs sole asset is the Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by BB&T which have an initial maturity on September15, 2063 and a final maturity date on September15, 2068. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are subject to early redemption (i)in whole, but not in part, at any time under certain prescribed limited circumstances or (ii)in whole, or in part, pursuant to the call provisions after September15, 2013. The Capital Securities of BBTCT V are subject to mandatory redemption in whole, or in part, upon repayment of the Junior Subordinated Debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption.
52 Table of Contents Liquidity needs are a primary consideration in evaluating funding sources. BB&Ts strategy is to maintain funding flexibility in order that the Corporation may react rapidly to opportunities that may become available in the marketplace. BB&T will continue to focus on traditional core funding strategies, supplemented as needed by the types of borrowings discussed above. See Liquidity herein for additional discussion.
Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity totaled $16.0 billion at December31, 2008, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 27.0%, from year-end 2007. This increase reflects the $3.1 billion of capital invested by the U.S. Treasury in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during 2008, BB&T issued 13.3million common shares of stock in connection with business combinations, equity-based incentive plans, the Companys dividend reinvestment plan and a private placement of shares sold to the Companys pension plan. These transactions increased shareholders equity by $357 million. Additionally, growth of $491 million in shareholders equity resulted from BB&Ts earnings retained after dividends to common shareholders. This growth was partially offset by a decrease to shareholders equity of $628 million from other comprehensive income, which principally relates to decreases in the fair values of available-for-sale securities and pension assets.
Analysis of Results of Operations Consolidated net income for 2008 totaled $1.52 billion. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $1.50 billion, which generated basic earnings per common share of $2.73 and diluted earnings per common share of $2.71. Net income for 2007 was $1.73 billion and net income for 2006 totaled $1.53 billion. Basic earnings per common share were $3.17 in 2007 and $2.84 in 2006, while diluted earnings per common share were $3.14 and $2.81 for 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Two important and commonly used measures of bank profitability are return on average assets (net income as a percentage of average total assets) and return on average common shareholders equity (net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders equity). BB&Ts returns on average assets were 1.11%, 1.37%, and 1.34% for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The returns on average common shareholders equity were 11.44%, 14.25%, and 13.35% for the last three years.
Net Interest Income Net interest income is BB&Ts primary source of revenue. Net interest income is influenced by a number of factors, including the volume, mix and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid thereon. The difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and the cost of the supporting funds (with an adjustment made to tax-exempt items to provide comparability with taxable items, i.e. the FTE adjustment) is measured by the net interest margin. The accompanying table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense, and distinguishes between the changes related to increases or decreases in average outstanding balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume), and the changes related to increases or decreases in average interest rates on such assets and liabilities (rate). Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.
For 2008, net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis totaled $4.3 billion, compared with $3.9 billion in 2007 and $3.8 billion in 2006. Net interest income increased 9.4% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in net interest income during 2008 resulted primarily from liability costs repricing more quickly as short-term rates declined throughout the year. Net interest income increased 4.0% in 2007 compared to 2006, as the benefit from strong average earning asset growth of 10.6% was partially offset by the adverse impact from higher short-term rates in 2007 compared to 2006, which caused funding costs to increase at a faster pace than interest on earning assets.
The FTE-adjusted net interest margin is the primary measure used in evaluating the gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning assets. The FTE-adjusted net interest margin was 3.58% in 2008, 3.52% in 2007 and 3.74% in 2006. The average yield on interest earning assets decreased 105 basis points compared to the average yield during 2007, while the average cost of funds over the same time period decreased 130 basis points. The Federal Reserve Board began lowering rates in September 2007 and lowered short-term rates by 100 basis points in the last four months of 2007 and an additional 400 basis points during 2008. While many of BB&Ts liabilities 53 Table of Contents reprice in a short period of time after a change in rates, there is typically a delay of between three and eighteen months before BB&Ts assets will be repriced. The improvement in the net interest margin during 2008 was caused by a combination of factors. BB&T entered 2008 in a liability sensitive position, which means that interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice more frequently than interest-earning assets. This resulted in lower funding costs throughout 2008, as interest-rates declined. Additionally, BB&T experienced some improvement in loan pricing in 2008. The net interest margin was negatively impacted five basis points by an adjustment of $67 million, as a result of a change in the income recognition on leveraged lease transactions in connection with BB&Ts settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In addition, the net interest margin has been negatively affected by the higher level of non-performing assets in 2008. The net interest margin contracted in 2007 for four primary reasons. First, the mix of asset growth shifted from higher-yielding commercial real estate and direct retail loans to lower-yielding mortgage loans and commercial and industrial loans. Second, higher levels of nonaccruals have negatively affected net interest income and the net interest margin. Third, increased liability costs, specifically a shift to higher-cost deposits from lower-cost transaction accounts and additional funding costs associated with a payment to the IRS that was made in January 2007 as described in the Provision for Income Taxes section below, contributed to the margin compression.

55 Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses A provision for credit losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments that reflects managements best estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios at the balance sheet date. The amount of the provision is based on continuing assessments of nonperforming and watch list loans and associated unfunded credit commitments, analytical reviews of loss experience in relation to outstanding loans and funded credit commitments, loan charge-offs, nonperforming asset trends and managements judgment with respect to current and expected economic conditions and their impact on the loan portfolio and outstanding unfunded credit commitments. The methodology used is described in the Overview and Description of Business section under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments. The provision for credit losses recorded by BB&T in 2008 was $1.4 billion, compared with $448 million in 2007 and $240 million in 2006.
The provision for credit losses increased 222.5% during 2008 while total loans and leases held for investment increased 7.0% compared to the balance outstanding at the end of 2007. Net charge-offs were .89% of average loans and leases for 2008 compared to .38% of average loans and leases during 2007. The allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.62% of loans and leases held for investment and was 1.11x total nonaccrual loans and leases at year-end 2008, compared to 1.10% and 2.00x, respectively, at December31, 2007. The increase in the provision for credit losses during 2008 compared to 2007 was largely driven by challenges in residential real estate markets and the overall economy with the largest concentration of credit issues occurring in Georgia, Florida, and metro Washington D.C. Additional disclosures related to BB&Ts real estate lending by product type and geographic distribution can be found in Table 6 herein. The 86.7% increase in the provision for credit losses during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily the result of these same issues.
Noninterest Income Noninterest income has become, and will continue to be, a significant contributor to BB&Ts financial success. Noninterest income includes insurance income, service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking income, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, trust and investment advisory revenues, gains and losses on securities transactions, and commissions and fees derived from other activities. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenues has steadily increased in recent years, totaling 41.4% for 2008. Exceeding 40% on this measure has been a management objective for several years. Management has established a goal for noninterest income to exceed 45% of total revenues in the next few years to further reduce BB&Ts reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.
56 Table of Contents The following table provides a breakdown of BB&Ts noninterest income: Table 16 Noninterest Income Years Ended December 31, % Change 2008 v.

These increases were partially offset by declines in income from bank-owned life insurance and trust and investment advisory revenues. The 10.0% growth in noninterest income for 2007 was the result of increased revenues from all of BB&Ts major fee-based businesses. These increases were partially offset by trading losses at Scott& Stringfellow. The major categories of noninterest income and fluctuations in these amounts are discussed in the following paragraphs. These fluctuations reflect the impact of acquisitions.
Income from BB&Ts insurance agency/brokerage operations were the largest source of noninterest income. Internal growth, combined with the expansion of BB&Ts insurance agency network through acquisitions during the last two years, resulted in growth of 8.8% in 2008 and 4.9% in 2007. The increase in insurance income in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily related to revenues from a new product initiative that was introduced in the second half of 2007. Additionally, commissions for property and casualty and employee benefit insurance each increased $19 million. The increase in insurance commissions in 2008 compared to 2007 was largely a result of acquisitions completed during the year as soft market conditions affected the existing book of business. The increase in commission income during 2007 was primarily related to the sale of property and casualty, and employee benefit insurance, which increased $17 million and $9 million, respectively, compared to 2006.
Service charges on deposit accounts represent BB&Ts second largest category of noninterest revenue. Service charge revenue grew $62 million, or 10.1%. Service charge revenue increased $63 million, or 11.5%, during 2007. The increases in service charge revenue were primarily due to higher revenues from overdraft items and strong transaction account growth during 2007 and 2008.
Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions increased $11 million, or 3.2%, compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increased revenues of $19 million from BB&T Capital Markets, a division of Scott& Stringfellow. This increase was partially offset by a decline of $13 million related to commissions from retail accounts at Scott& Stringfellow. The 8.2% increase in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted primarily from increased revenues of $20 million at Scott& Stringfellow. The remainder of the increase was generated by BB&T Investment Services, Inc.
Other nondeposit fees and commissions, including bankcard fees and merchant discounts and checkcard fees increased $38 million, or 7.6%, during 2008 compared to 2007. During 2007, these categories increased $59 million, 57 Table of Contents or 13.3%, compared to 2006. The increases in 2008 and 2007 included additional checkcard fees of $21 million and $25 million, respectively, as clients continued to show a preference for utilizing electronic forms of payment rather than traditional paper checks. Bankcard fees also grew $12 million in 2008 compared to 2007 and $17 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as a result of strong sales of merchant services.
Trust and investment advisory revenues are based on the types of services provided as well as the overall value of the assets managed, which is affected by stock market conditions. During 2008, trust and investment advisory revenues decreased by $15 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2007. During 2007, trust and investment advisory revenues increased by $8 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2006. The value of trust assets under management, including custodial accounts, has varied accordingly and was $33.4 billion, $36.9 billion and $33.7 billion at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Income from mortgage banking activities includes gains and losses from the sale of mortgage loans, revenue from servicing mortgage loans, valuation adjustments for mortgage servicing rights, mortgage servicing rights-related derivative gains/losses and the amortization or realization of expected mortgage servicing rights cash flows. Mortgage banking income totaled $275 million, $115 million and $108 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table provides a breakdown of the various components of mortgage banking income and related statistical information: Table 17 Mortgage Banking Income and Related Statistical Information As of/ For the Years Ended December 31, % Change 2008 v.

2006 Mortgage Banking Statistical Information 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Residential mortgage originations $ 16,438 $ 11,940 $ 9,889 37.7 % 20.7 % Residential mortgage loans serviced for others 40,677 32,093 28,232 26.7 13.7 Residential mortgage loan sales 13,405 7,547 5,282 77.6 42.9 Commercial mortgage originations 3,717 3,012 2,906 23.4 3.6 Commercial mortgage loans serviced for others 23,902 20,752 9,206 15.2 125.4 58 Table of Contents Mortgage banking income increased $160 million, or 139.1% during 2008. BB&T adopted SFAS No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 , (SFAS No.159 or the Fair Value Option) for the majority of loans originated for sale after January1, 2008, and implemented the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No.109 Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value through Earnings (SAB 109). As a result of the adoption of both standards, mortgage banking income increased approximately $74 million compared to 2007. Of the $74 million increase relating to the adoption of these accounting standards, approximately $55 million relates to the elimination of the provisions of SFAS No.91 Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leasesan amendment of FASB Statements No.13, 60, and 65 and a rescission of FASB Statement No.17 , (SFAS No.91) on loans accounted for at fair value and resulted in a corresponding increase in personnel expense. The net change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights resulted in a $38 million increase compared to 2007. The $38 million increase was the result of the mortgage servicing rights hedge outperforming the decline in the value of the asset. The positive hedge performance was attributable to (i)the strong appreciation of option-based hedge instruments, which occurs during periods of extreme interest rate volatility, and (ii)the favorable hedge effectiveness against the interest rate basis movements between mortgages and swap-based hedge instruments. Excluding the impact of these items, mortgage banking income increased $48 million, or 43.2%, compared to the prior year. The growth in mortgage banking income includes strong production revenues from both residential and commercial mortgage banking operations. The growth in commercial mortgage banking revenues was the result of the acquisition of Collateral Real Estate Capital, LLC (Collateral) in the fourth quarter of 2007. BB&T combined the operations of Collateral with its existing mortgage banking operations and renamed the subsidiary Grandbridge Real Estate Capital LLC (Grandbridge). The acquisition of Collateral significantly expanded the size and product offerings of BB&Ts commercial mortgage banking activities. Mortgage banking income increased $7 million, or 6.5%, during 2007. The growth in 2007 included an increase of $4 million, or 11.1%, in commercial mortgage banking income primarily generated by Grandbridge. The acquisition of Collateral in the fourth quarter of 2007 was the primary reason for the 125.4% increase in commercial mortgage loans serviced for others at year-end 2007 compared to the prior year-end. BB&Ts residential mortgage banking income also increased $3 million during 2007 compared to 2006. While residential mortgage loan sales increased 42.9% during 2007, gains and other revenues associated with those sales only increased 2.2% due to increased competition in the marketplace.
BB&T recognized $107 million in net securities gains during 2008 compared to net losses of $3 million and $73 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net securities gains recognized in 2008 included $211 million of gains from securities sales and $104 million of losses as a result of other-than-temporary impairments. The losses recognized in 2006 were primarily in connection with an announced restructuring of a portion of the securities portfolio that was undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Income from bank owned life insurance (BOLI) decreased $17 million, or 16.8%, in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a valuation adjustment that resulted from a decline in the underlying assets of certain insurance policies. BOLI income increased $8 million, or 8.6%, in 2007 compared to 2006.
Other income decreased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007. The current year included gains related to BB&Ts ownership interest and sale of Visa, Inc. stock that amounted to $80 million. In addition, revenues from client derivative activities were $22 million higher in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were offset by a number of factors, including a $50 million decline in the value of various financial assets isolated for the purpose of providing post-employment benefits. The decline in the value of these assets is neutral to net income as these losses relate toparticipants accounts and reduce the amount of benefits that will be paid in the future. Earnings from investments in low income housing partnerships that generate tax benefits declined $39 million and net revenues from BB&Ts venture capital investments declined $26 million. In addition, the current years results were affectedby certain items that were recorded in 2007, including the sale of an insurance operation and losses from capital markets activities as mentioned below. The 23.9%, or $28 million, decrease in 2007 compared to 2006, was primarily due to approximately $33 million in losses from capital markets activities during the last half of 2007. These losses were primarily caused by disruptions in the financial markets that decreased the value of certain trading securities and derivative contracts. In addition, BB&T sold an insurance operation during 2007, which produced a gain of $19 million. BB&T also generated $17 million in additional revenues from client derivative activities. Other income for 2007 also reflects lower revenues from venture capital investments, which decreased 59 Table of Contents $15 million compared to 2006, and decreased revenues of $11 million related to various financial assets isolated for the purpose of providing post-employment benefits.
The ability to generate significant amounts of noninterest revenue in the future will be very important to the continued financial success of BB&T. Through its subsidiaries, BB&T will continue to focus on asset management, mortgage banking, trust, insurance, investment banking and brokerage services, as well as other fee-producing products and services. BB&T plans to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional financial services companies, including insurance agencies and other fee income producing businesses as a means of expanding fee-based revenues. Also, among BB&Ts principal strategies following the acquisition of a financial institution is the cross-sell of noninterest income generating products and services to the acquired institutions client base. As previously mentioned, management has set a goal to increase the contribution of noninterest revenue sources to 45% over the next few years.
Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense totaled $3.9 billion in 2008, $3.6 billion in 2007 and $3.5 billion in 2006. Noninterest expense includes certain merger-related and restructuring charges recorded during the years 2008, 2007 and 2006 as noted in Table 18 below. These amounts totaled $15 million in 2008, $21 million in 2007 and $18 million in 2006. Additional disclosures related to these merger-related and restructuring charges are presented in Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges. The table below shows the components of noninterest expense and the discussion that follows explains the composition of certain categories and the factors that caused them to change in 2008 and 2007.
Table 18 Noninterest Expense Years Ended December 31, % Change 2008 v.
2007 2007 v.
2006 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Salaries and wages $ 1,863 $ 1,715 $ 1,700 8.6 % .9 % Pension and other employee benefits 338 379 377 (10.8 ) .5 Total personnel expenses 2,201 2,094 2,077 5.1 .8 Net occupancy expense on bank premises 310 286 253 8.4 13.0 Furniture and equipment expense 199 191 196 4.2 (2.6 ) Total occupancy and equipment expenses 509 477 449 6.7 6.2 Professional services 200 139 120 43.9 15.8 Loan processing expenses 125 111 103 12.6 7.8 Amortization of intangibles 100 104 104 (3.8 )  Foreclosed property expense 79 31 18 154.8 72.2 Software 74 58 58 27.6  Travel and transportation 52 52 48  8.3 Advertising and public relations 50 45 55 11.1 (18.2 ) Deposit related expense 49 43 38 14.0 13.2 Other marketing expense 46 46 30  53.3 Telephone 42 43 44 (2.3 ) (2.3 ) Supplies 40 38 37 5.3 2.7 Regulatory charges 30 14 15 114.3 (6.7 ) Merger-related and restructuring charges, net 15 21 18 (28.6 ) 16.7 Other noninterest expenses 309 320 302 (3.4 ) 6.0 Total noninterest expense $ 3,921 $ 3,636 $ 3,516 7.8 3.4 60 Table of Contents The 7.8% increase in total noninterest expense during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in personnel costs, professional services and foreclosed property expense. The 3.4% increase in total noninterest expense during 2007 compared to 2006 reflects strong cost controls. The increases during 2008 and 2007 were impacted by the acquisitions of AFCO and Coastal during 2007 and several nonbank financial services companies during 2008 and 2007.
Total personnel expense is the largest component of noninterest expense and includes salaries and wages, as well as pension and other employee benefit costs. The 2008 increase of 5.1% resulted primarily from additional salaries and wages as a result of acquisitions and the implementation of the fair value option for loans held for sale, which changed the accounting for loan origination costs. Total salaries and wages expense increased $148 million, or 8.6%, in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to annual salary increases and higher overall headcount. The increase also includes approximately $55 million related to the change in accounting for loans held for sale as discussed previously and a decrease in annual incentive compensation. The 10.8% decrease in pension and other employee benefit costs was driven by a decrease in nonqualified defined contribution expense of $52 million, which is based on the value of assets in the participants accounts. In addition, defined benefit plan expenses were down $23 million compared to 2007 due to contributions made to the qualified pension plan in 2007 and 2008 that increased the estimated return on plan assets that is recorded as a component of defined benefit plan expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in health care and other welfare expenses of $20 million compared to 2007. The 2007 increase of .8% resulted primarily from additional salaries and wages as a result of acquisitions and an increase in health care expenses. Total salaries and wages expense increased $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006, including higher equity-based compensation, which grew $12 million compared to 2006. The .5% increase in pension and other employee benefit costs was also affected by the additional salaries and wages expense, which caused increases in social security taxes and defined contribution plan expenses of $5 million each compared to 2006. In addition, health care and other welfare expenses increased $14 million which were offset by a decrease in pension expense of $18 million compared to 2006. Additional disclosures relating to BB&Ts benefit plans can be found in Note 14 Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $32 million, or 6.7%, in 2008. During 2007, net occupancy and equipment expense increased by $28 million, or 6.2%. The increases in 2008 and 2007 were largely a result of increased lease expenses due to BB&Ts de novo branching strategy.
Other noninterest expenses increased $146 million, or 13.7%, compared to 2007, which reflected an increase of $75 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2006. The 2008 increase was primarily the result of increases in professional services and foreclosed property expense of $61 million and $48 million, respectively, which are directly related to the downturn in the residential real estate markets. Regulatory charges, software expenses and loan processing costs also increased $16 million, $16 million and $14 million, respectively, from the prior year. The 2007 increase reflected higher professional services, marketing expenses, foreclosed property expenses and loan processing costs. The increases for 2008 and 2007 were impacted by acquisitions completed during the past two years. Please refer to Table 18 for additional detail on fluctuations in other categories of noninterest expense.
Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges BB&T recorded certain merger-related and restructuring charges during the years 2008, 2007 and 2006. These charges are reflected in BB&Ts Consolidated Statements of Income as a category of noninterest expense. Please Refer to Note 2 Business Combinations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of mergers and acquisitions consummated during the three years ended December31, 2008.
The 2008 net merger-related and restructuring charges of $15 million were primarily associated with the acquisitions of insurance agencies and other merger-related and restructuring activities. During 2007, BB&T recorded merger-related and restructuring charges of $21 million. These expenses were recorded in connection with the acquisition of Coastal and other merger-related and restructuring activities. During 2006, BB&T recorded $18 million of merger-related and restructuring charges. These amounts were primarily associated with the write-off of duplicate software and systems conversions in connection with the acquisition of Main Street Banks Inc., which was completed during the year.
61 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of merger-related and restructuring charges included in noninterest expenses. This table includes changes to previously recorded merger-related accruals and period expenses for merger-related items that must be expensed as incurred. Items that are required to be expensed as incurred include certain expenses associated with systems conversions, data processing, training, and other costs.
Table 19 Summary of Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges (Gains) For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Severance and personnel-related $ 5 $ 8 $ 2 Occupancy and equipment 3 2 (2 ) Other 7 11 18 Total $ 15 $ 21 $ 18 Severance and personnel-related costs or credits include severance, employee retention, payments related to change-in-control provisions of employment contracts, outplacement services and other benefits associated with employee termination or reversals of previously estimated amounts, which typically occur in corporate support and data processing functions. Occupancy and equipment charges or credits represent merger-related and restructuring costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs, and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment. Credits may result when obsolete properties or equipment are sold for more than originally estimated. Other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, litigation accruals, and other similar charges.
In conjunction with the consummation of an acquisition and the completion of other requirements, BB&T typically accrues certain merger-related expenses related to estimated severance and other personnel costs, costs to terminate lease contracts, costs related to the disposal of duplicate facilities and equipment, costs to terminate data processing contracts and other costs associated with an acquisition. The following tables present a summary of activity with respect to BB&Ts merger and restructuring accruals. These tables include costs reflected as expenses, as presented in the table above, and certain accruals recorded through purchase accounting adjustments.
Merger-related And Restructuring Accrual Activity (Dollars in millions) Balance January1, 2007 Accrued at acquisition Merger- related and restructuring charges Utilized Other, net Balance December31, 2007 Severance and personnel-related $ 12 $ 4 $ 8 $ (15 ) $  $ 9 Occupancy and equipment 4 1 2 (3 )  4 Other 2 3 11 (13 )  3 Total $ 18 $ 8 $ 21 $ (31 ) $  $ 16 Balance January 1, 2008 Accrued at acquisition Merger- related and restructuring charges Utilized Other, net Balance December 31, 2008 Severance and personnel-related $ 9 $ 3 $ 5 $ (10 ) $  $ 7 Occupancy and equipment 4 1 3 (2 )  6 Other 3 8 7 (8 ) 1 11 Total $ 16 $ 12 $ 15 $ (20 ) $ 1 $ 24 62 Table of Contents The liabilities for severance and personnel-related costs relate to severance liabilities that will be paid out based on such factors as expected termination dates, the provisions of employment contracts and the terms of BB&Ts severance plans. The remaining occupancy and equipment accruals relate to costs to exit certain leases and to dispose of excess facilities and equipment. Such liabilities will be utilized upon termination of the various leases and sale of duplicate property.
In general, a major portion of accrued costs are utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems conversion, when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. Other accruals are utilized over time based on the sale, closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of lease contracts. Merger accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. The remaining accruals at December31, 2008 are expected to be utilized during 2009, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire in later years.
Provision for Income Taxes BB&Ts provision for income taxes totaled $550 million for 2008, a decrease of $286 million, or 34.2%, compared to 2007. The decline in the provision for income taxes during 2008 was largely due to lower pretax income, offset by a credit of $60 million related to leveraged leases as discussed below. The provisions for income taxes totaled $836 million in 2007 and $945 million in 2006. BB&Ts effective tax rates for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 26.6%, 32.5%, and 38.2%, respectively. In 2006, the higher provision for income taxes and the higher effective tax rate were primarily the result of an adjustment of $139 million to BB&Ts tax reserves for leveraged lease transactions as discussed below. A reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate is included in Note 13 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein.
BB&T has extended credit to, and invested in, the obligations of states and municipalities and their agencies, and has made other investments and loans that produce tax-exempt income. The income generated from these investments together with certain other transactions that have favorable tax treatment have reduced BB&Ts overall effective tax rate from the statutory rate in 2008, 2007 and 2006.
BB&T continually monitors and evaluates the potential impact of current events and circumstances on the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis of its income tax positions and, accordingly, BB&Ts effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future. On a periodic basis, BB&T evaluates its income tax positions based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This evaluation takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities examinations of BB&Ts tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment in relation to tax-advantaged transactions. Accordingly, the results of these examinations may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. In addition, BB&T may make payments or deposits to the IRS in connection with tax disputes to stop the accrual of additional interest and penalties, while it pursues resolution of these matters. Please refer to Note 13 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional disclosures related to BB&Ts unresolved tax issues related to tax examinations by the IRS and other taxing authorities.
The IRS disallowed certain deductions taken by BB&T on leveraged lease transactions during 1997-2002. In 2004, BB&T filed a lawsuit against the IRS to pursue a refund of amounts assessed by the IRS related to a leveraged lease transaction entered into during 1997. On January4, 2007, the United States Middle District Court of North Carolina issued a summary judgment in favor of the IRS related to BB&Ts lawsuit. Based on a review of the summary judgment by BB&Ts counsel, BB&T filed a notice of appeal with the United States Appeals Court for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, Virginia. On April29, 2008, the United States Appeals Court for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower courts decision.
Due to the timing of the District Courts ruling and its potential impact on BB&Ts other leveraged lease transactions, BB&T recorded $139 million in additional reserves in the fourth quarter of 2006 and paid $1.2 billion to the IRS during the first quarter of 2007. This payment represented the total tax and interest due on these transactions for all open years. The tax paid relates to differences in the timing of income recognition and deductions for income tax purposes for which deferred taxes had been previously provided. During the fourth quarter of 2008, BB&T agreed to treat its leveraged leases in accordance with the IRSs proposal that, among 63 Table of Contents other things, allows 20% of deductions, imputes interest income and deems the remaining transactions to be terminated as of December31, 2008. As a result of this settlement, BB&T recognized pre-tax interest income of $93 million, or $60 million after-tax, which is reflected as a reduction in tax expense. As a result of changes in the timing of tax payments, FSP FAS 13-2 required a recalculation of each transaction that resulted in a $67 million charge to interest income and a corresponding $24 million tax benefit.
Market Risk Management The effective management of market risk is essential to achieving BB&Ts strategic financial objectives. As a financial institution, BB&Ts most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk; however, market risk also includes product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk. The primary objective of interest rate risk management is to minimize any adverse effect that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. This is accomplished through active management of asset and liability portfolios with a focus on the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity mixes of assets and liabilities. The goal of these activities is the development of appropriate maturity and repricing opportunities in BB&Ts portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates. BB&Ts Market Risk and Liquidity Committee monitors loan, investment and liability portfolios to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk. These portfolios are analyzed for proper fixed-rate and variable-rate mixes under various interest rate scenarios.
The asset/liability management process is designed to achieve relatively stable net interest margins and assure liquidity by coordinating the volumes, maturities or repricing opportunities of earning assets, deposits and borrowed funds. It is the responsibility of the Market Risk and Liquidity Committee to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as to ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital, within the context of corporate performance goals. The Market Risk and Liquidity Committee also sets policy guidelines and establishes long-term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity. The Market Risk and Liquidity Committee meets regularly to review BB&Ts interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to ensure that the potential impact on earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is within acceptable standards.
BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to manage various financial risks. These instruments, commonly referred to as derivatives, primarily consist of interest-rate swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, collars, financial forward and futures contracts, when-issued securities and options written and purchased. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage risk related to securities, business loans, Federal funds purchased, long-term debt, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage banking operations and certificates of deposit. BB&T also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. BB&Ts derivatives produced a benefit to net interest income of $101 million during 2008 and resulted in a decrease in net interest income of $19 million and $8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in benefits to net interest income from 2007 to 2008 can primarily be attributed to decreases in rates that affected the benefits received on BB&Ts interest rate swaps on its medium and long-term debt.
Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts. Notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties, and are not a measure of financial risk. On December31, 2008, BB&T had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $74.2 billion. The estimated net fair value of open contracts was $626 million at December31, 2008.
See Note 19 Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein for additional disclosures.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Interest Rates The majority of BB&Ts assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories.
64 Table of Contents Fluctuations in interest rates and actions of the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institutions profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through its balance sheet management function, which is monitored by the Market Risk and Liquidity Committee, management believes that BB&T is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity, changes in interest rates and inflationary trends.
BB&Ts interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table. The table reflects rate-sensitive positions at December31, 2008, and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates. The carrying amounts of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap. To reflect anticipated prepayments, certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows.

Management uses Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis (Simulation) to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. The Simulation model projects net interest income and interest rate risk for a rolling two-year period of time. Simulation takes into account the current contractual agreements that BB&T has made with its customers on deposits, borrowings, loans, investments and any commitments to enter into those transactions. Management monitors BB&Ts interest sensitivity by means of a computer model that incorporates the current volumes, average rates earned and paid, and scheduled maturities and payments of asset and liability portfolios, together with multiple scenarios of projected prepayments, repricing opportunities and anticipated volume growth. Using this information, the model projects earnings based on projected portfolio balances under multiple interest rate scenarios. This level of detail is needed to simulate the effect that changes in interest rates and portfolio balances may have on the earnings of BB&T. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but management believes that it provides a better illustration of the 65 Table of Contents sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses such as static or dynamic gap. In addition to Simulation analysis, BB&T uses Economic Value of Equity (EVE) analysis to focus on changes in capital given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also allows BB&T to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the analysis window contained in the Simulation model. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the entire portfolio of BB&Ts assets, liabilities, and derivatives instruments. The difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as the economic value of the Banks equity.
The asset/liability management process requires a number of key assumptions. Management determines the most likely outlook for the economy and interest rates by analyzing external factors, including published economic projections and data, the effects of likely monetary and fiscal policies, as well as any enacted or prospective regulatory changes. BB&Ts current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance are also considered. This data is combined with various interest rate scenarios to provide management with the information necessary to analyze interest sensitivity and to aid in the development of strategies to reach performance goals.
The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months under the most likely interest rate scenario incorporated into the Interest Sensitivity Simulation computer model. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing, deposit sensitivity, customer preferences and capital plans. The resulting change in interest sensitive income reflects the level of sensitivity that interest sensitive income has in relation to changing interest rates.

The new parameters for asset/liability management prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income of 2% for the next 12 months for a linear change of 100 basis points over four months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining eight month period, and a maximum negative impact of 4% for a linear change of 200 basis points over eight months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining four month period. Previously, managements policy was a maximum negative impact on net interest income of 3% for the next 12 months for a linear change of 150 basis points over six months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining six month period, and a maximum negative impact of 6% for a linear change of 300 basis points over 12 months. Management only modeled a negative 25 basis point decline in the current period, because larger declines would have resulted in a Federal Funds rate of less than zero.
66 Table of Contents The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on EVE as projected under the most likely interest rate scenario incorporated into the EVE model. Key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing, and deposit sensitivity. The resulting change in the economic value of equity reflects the level of sensitivity that EVE has in relation to changing interest rates.

In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as trading securities and securities available for sale, many other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity in national money markets, growing core deposits, the repayment of loans and the capability to securitize or package loans for sale.
The purpose of BB&T Corporation (the Parent Company) is to serve as the capital financing vehicle for the operating subsidiaries. The assets of the Parent Company consist primarily of cash on deposit with Branch Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, accounts receivable from subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous assets. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are principal and interest on master notes, long-term debt, and redeemable capital securities. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and master notes. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are for the retirement of common stock, investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to shareholders, and interest and principal payments due on long-term debt and master notes.
The primary source of funds used for Parent Company cash requirements has been dividends declared from Branch Bank, which totaled $1.2 billion during 2008, and net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which totaled $716 million in 2008. Funds raised through master note agreements with commercial clients are placed in a note receivable at Branch Bank primarily for its use in meeting short-term funding needs and, to a lesser extent, to support the short-term temporary cash needs of the Parent Company. At December31, 2008 and 2007, master note balances totaled $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
In late 2005, the SEC passed major changes to the securities registration process, which especially benefited larger companies who frequently access the capital markets. The changes to the securities registration process allow companies who have met certain eligibility requirements to file a registration statement that immediately becomes effective and permits the company to pay the fees related to the registration of the securities at the time of issuance. This has effectively eliminated the need to periodically file shelf registration statements and estimate the amount of securities that will be needed in the future. The change in regulations also has greatly enhanced the ability of BB&T to access the capital markets.
The Parent Company had five issues of subordinated notes outstanding totaling $3.1 billion at December31, 2008. In addition, as of December31, 2008, BB&T had $2.3 billion of junior subordinated debentures outstanding to unconsolidated trusts. Please refer to Note 10 Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information with respect to these subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures.
67 Table of Contents Branch Bank has several major sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements, including access to capital markets through issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes and institutional certificates of deposit, access to the FHLB system, dealer repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with commercial clients, participation in the Treasury, Tax and Loan and Special Direct Investment programs with the Federal Reserve Bank, access to the overnight and term Federal funds markets, use of a Cayman branch facility, access to retail brokered certificates of deposit and a borrower in custody program with the Federal Reserve Bank for the discount window. As of December31, 2008, BB&T has approximately $44 billion of secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 242% of one year wholesale funding maturities.
BB&Ts and Branch Banks ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies views of BB&Ts and Branch Banks credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a routine basis to discuss the current outlook for BB&T and Branch Bank. The ratings for BB&T and Branch Bank by the four major rating agencies are detailed in the table below.

The CFP is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under various stress scenarios. Additionally, the CFP provides a framework for management and other critical personnel to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The CFP addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction.
Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet BB&Ts current requirements and plans for continued growth. See Note 6 Premises and Equipment, Note 10 Long-Term Debt and Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Related Party Transactions The following table presents, as of December31, 2008, BB&Ts significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient. The table excludes liabilities recorded in connection with FASB Interpretation No.48 Accounting for 68 Table of Contents uncertainty in Income Taxes because management cannot reasonably estimate the timing of any payments that may be required in connection with these liabilities. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Table 24 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments December 31, 2008 Total Lessthan OneYear 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years After 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Contractual Cash Obligations Long-term debt $ 18,032 $ 536 $ 2,488 $ 1,733 $ 13,275 Operating leases 934 131 220 153 430 Commitments to fund affordable housing investments 412 247 134 22 9 Venture capital commitments 222 68 117 13 24 Time deposits 47,216 34,594 8,498 3,768 356 Total contractual cash obligations $ 66,816 $ 35,576 $ 11,457 $ 5,689 $ 14,094 BB&Ts significant commitments include certain investments in affordable housing and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area. BB&T enters into such arrangements as a means of supporting local communities and recognizes tax credits relating to these investments. At December31, 2008, BB&Ts investments in such projects totaled $891 million, which includes outstanding commitments of $412 million. BB&T typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. Branch Bank typically provides financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had $161 million in loan commitments outstanding related to these projects, of which $81 million had been funded. BB&Ts risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and loan commitments made. Please refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these investments in limited partnerships.
In addition, BB&T enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts, which only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and are not a measure of financial risk. Therefore, the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet as of December31, 2008 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 19 Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from litigation. BB&T also issues standard representation and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to BB&T. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T.
BB&T holds public funds in certain states that do not require 100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis by the remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that state.
BB&T has investments and future funding commitments to certain venture capital funds. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had investments of $168 million, net of minority interest, related to these ventures and future 69 Table of Contents funding commitments of $222 million. BB&Ts risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and future funding commitments made.
Merger and acquisition agreements of businesses other than financial institutions occasionally include additional incentives to the acquired entities to offset the loss of future cash flows previously received through ownership positions. Typically, these incentives are based on the acquired entitys contribution to BB&Ts earnings compared to agreed-upon amounts. When offered, these incentives are typically issued for terms of three to five years. As certain provisions of these agreements do not specify dollar limitations, it is not possible to quantify the maximum exposure resulting from these agreements.
In the normal course of business, BB&T is also a party to financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. Such financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial guarantee arrangements. Further discussion of these commitments is included in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
BB&T previously contracted with an independent third party for the disbursement of official checks. BB&T terminated its arrangement with the third party during 2008. Under the terms of the agreement, BB&T acted as an agent for the third party in the issuance of official checks. Funds received from the buyers of official checks were transferred to the third party issuer to cover the checks when they are ultimately presented for payment. At December31, 2008, the third party issuer had outstanding official checks that had been sold by BB&T totaling $97 million. The official check program is contractually arranged to substantially limit BB&Ts exposure to loss, since the third party is required to invest the funds received and maintain an equal relationship between outstanding checks and the balances available to cover the checks. BB&T monitors this relationship through a reconciliation process. However, in the event that the third party failed to honor official checks BB&T had sold as its agent, it is likely that BB&T would choose to reimburse the purchasers, though not contractually or legally obligated to do so.
BB&Ts significant commitments and obligations are summarized in the accompanying table. Not all of the commitments presented in the table will be used thus the actual cash requirements are likely to be significantly less than the amounts reported.
Table 25 Summary of Significant Commitments December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Lines of credit $ 15,270 Commercial letters of credit 34 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written 5,861 Other commitments (1) 19,874 Total significant commitments $ 41,039 (1) Other commitments include unfunded business loan commitments, unfunded overdraft protection on demand deposit accounts and other unfunded commitments to lend.
Related Party Transactions The Corporation may extend credit to certain officers and directors in the ordinary course of business. These loans are made under substantially the same terms as comparable third-party lending arrangements and are in compliance with applicable banking regulations.
Capital The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. BB&Ts principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support BB&Ts comprehensive risk profile, to preserve a sufficient capital base from which to support future growth, to provide a competitive return to shareholders, to comply with regulatory standards and to achieve optimal credit ratings for BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries.
70 Table of Contents Management regularly monitors the capital position of BB&T on a consolidated basis. In this regard, managements overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that will result in BB&T being classified as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes and to maintain sufficient capital relative to the Corporations level of risk. Secondarily, it is managements intent to maintain consolidated capital levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with BB&Ts peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. Further, management particularly monitors and intends to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: Tier 1 Capital Ratio 8.50 % Total Capital Ratio 12.00 % Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio 7.00 % Tangible Common Equity Ratio 5.50 % Payments of cash dividends to BB&Ts shareholders, which have generally been in the range of 40.0% to 60.0% of earnings, and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. In addition, management closely monitors the Parent Companys double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders equity) with the intention of maintaining the ratio below 125.0%. The active management of the subsidiaries equity capital, as described above, is the process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key element in the management of BB&Ts capital position.
The capital of the subsidiaries also is regularly monitored to determine if the levels that management believes are the most beneficial and efficient for their operations are maintained. Management intends to maintain capital at Branch Bank and BB&T FSB at levels that will result in these subsidiaries being classified as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is managements intent to maintain Branch Banks capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. If the capital levels of Branch Bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations, in the form of special dividend payments.
While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the Corporation temporarily falling below its minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is managements intent through capital planning to return to these targeted minimums within a reasonable period of time. Such temporary decreases below these minimums are not considered an infringement of BB&Ts overall capital policy provided the Corporation and Branch Bank remain well-capitalized.
Capital Adequacy and Resources Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to risk-based capital adequacy. Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.
Risk-based capital ratios measure capital as a percentage of a combination of risk-weighted balance sheet and off-balance sheet risk. The risk-weighted values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are determined in accordance with risk factors specified by Federal bank regulatory pronouncements.
Tier 1 capital is calculated as common shareholders equity, excluding the over- or underfunded status of postretirement benefit obligations, unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale, unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges, net of deferred income taxes; plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities, less nonqualifying intangible assets, net of applicable deferred income taxes, and certain nonfinancial equity investments. Tier 2 capital may consist of qualifying subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses. Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital combined are referred to as total regulatory capital. Tier 1 capital is required to be at least 4% of risk-weighted assets, and total capital must be at least 8% of risk-weighted assets, with one half of the minimum consisting of Tier 1 capital.
In addition to the risk-based capital measures described above, regulators have also established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations. The minimum required Tier 1 leverage ratio ranges from 3% to 5% depending upon Federal bank regulatory agency evaluations of an organizations overall safety and soundness. BB&Ts regulatory capital and ratios are set forth in the following table.

Simultaneously with the closing of this transaction, BB&T entered into a replacement capital covenant (the Replacement Capital Covenant) for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long-term indebtedness of the Company or its largest depository institution subsidiary (the Covered Debt). The Replacement Capital Covenant provides that neither BB&T nor any of its subsidiaries (including the Trust) will repay, redeem or purchase any of the Capital Securities and the securities held by the Trust (the Other Securities), as applicable, on or before the date specified in the Replacement Capital Covenant, with certain limited exceptions, except to the extent that, during the 180 days prior to the date of that repayment, redemption or purchase, the Company has received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that (i)have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Capital Securities or Other Securities, as applicable, at the time of repayment, redemption or purchase, and (ii)the Company has obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board.
The following table identifies the (i)closing date for the transaction, (ii)issuer, (iii)series of Capital Securities issued, (iv)Other Securities, and (v)applicable Covered Debt.

BB&Ts ability to generate liquid assets for distribution is dependent on the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. The payment of cash dividends is an integral part of providing a competitive return on shareholders investments. The Corporations policy is to accomplish this while retaining sufficient capital to support future growth and to meet regulatory requirements. BB&Ts common dividend payout ratio, computed by dividing dividends paid per common share by basic earnings per common share, was 68.13% in 2008 as compared to 55.52% in 2007. BB&Ts payout ratio was higher in 2008 due to lower earnings during the economic recession. BB&Ts annual cash dividends paid per common share increased 5.7% during 2008 to $1.86 per common share for the year, as compared to $1.76 per common share in 2007. This increase marked the 37th consecutive year that the Corporations annual cash dividend paid to shareholders has been increased. A discussion of dividend restrictions is included in Note 16 Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Regulatory Considerations section.
72 Table of Contents In addition, in connection with the sale of preferred stock to the Treasury Department under the CPP, BB&T is restricted from raising its dividend above the current level of $.47 per share, without the prior approval of the Treasury Department, for three years or until the preferred stock has been repaid.
BB&Ts common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BBT. BB&Ts common stock was held by approximately 358,000 shareholders at December31, 2008 compared to approximately 324,000 at December31, 2007. The accompanying table, Quarterly Summary of Market Prices and Dividends Paid on Common Stock, sets forth the quarterly high and low trading prices and closing sales prices for BB&Ts common stock and the dividends paid per share of common stock for each of the last eight quarters.

In accordance with North Carolina law, repurchased shares cannot be held as treasury stock, but revert to the status of authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase.
On June27, 2006, BB&Ts Board of Directors granted authority under a plan (the 2006 Plan) for the repurchase of up to 50million shares of BB&Ts common stock as needed for general corporate purposes. The 2006 Plan also authorizes the repurchase of the remaining shares from the previous authorization. The 2006 Plan remains in effect until all the authorized shares are repurchased unless modified by the Board of Directors. No shares were repurchased in connection with the 2006 Plan during 2008. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, BB&T repurchased 7million shares and 22million shares of common stock, respectively. In connection with the sale of preferred stock to the Treasury Department under the CPP, BB&T is restricted from repurchasing shares of its common stock, except for shares repurchased in connection with employee benefit plans based on normal past practices, for three years or until the preferred stock has been repaid.

73 Table of Contents Segment Results BB&Ts operations are divided into seven reportable business segments: the Banking Network, Residential Mortgage Banking, Sales Finance, Specialized Lending, Insurance Services, Financial Services, and Treasury. These operating segments have been identified based primarily on BB&Ts organizational structure. See Note 21 Operating Segments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein, for additional disclosures related to BB&Ts operating segments, the internal accounting and reporting practices used to manage these segments and financial disclosures for these segments as required by SFAS No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . Fluctuations in noninterest income and noninterest expense incurred directly by the segments are more fully discussed in the Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense sections of this discussion and analysis. Merger-related expenses in 2008, 2007 and 2006, the gains related to BB&Ts ownership interest with Visa, Inc. in 2008, certain securities gains and losses recorded in 2008, the net impact of the after-tax gain associated with BB&Ts leveraged lease settlement recorded in 2008, the additional tax provision recorded in 2006, the loss on sales of securities incurred in connection with the partial portfolio restructuring in 2006 and certain other charges are excluded from segment results as presented herein.
Banking Network The Banking Network had solid internal loan and deposit growth during 2008, with total assets at year-end 2008 increasing 7.6% compared to 2007. The total Banking Network was composed of 1,511 banking offices at the end of 2008, an increase of 19 offices compared to 1,492 banking offices at December31, 2007. The increase in offices was the result of a de novo branching strategy to expand BB&Ts presence in high growth markets and the acquisition of Haven Trust. Net income attributable to the Banking Network declined $588 million, or 35.9%, compared to 2007, primarily as a result of higher provision for loan loss expense. Comparing 2007 to 2006, net income in the Banking Network increased $86 million, or 5.5%.
Net interest income for the Banking Network totaled $3.2 billion in 2008 compared to $3.4 billion in 2007. The decline in the net interest income was primarily due to lower interest income on loans due to the decline in the prime rate that began in late 2007 and continued through 2008. Net interest income earned for 2007 increased by $130 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2006. The increase in net interest income during 2007 was primarily a result of an increase of $210 million in the net funds transfer pricing (FTP) credit provided to the Banking Network during 2007, offset by a decrease of $80 million in net interest income from clients. The decline in the net interest income from clients in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher interest expense on deposits due to a shift by clients to higher cost products and growth in CDs.

Allocated corporate expenses increased $112 million, or 19.0%, in 2008 primarily due to increased allocations for certain corporate overhead functions that were previously not allocated to the business units, and increases for loan administration expense, IT services and operations. The increase related to loan administration expense was the result in a change in the methodology for allocating these expenses between business segments. Comparing 2007 to 2006, allocated corporate expenses increased $60 million because of increased allocations of marketing and advertising expenses and other corporate support areas.

Specialized Lending BB&Ts Specialized Lending segment continued to expand during 2008 primarily through internal growth. Net income from the Specialized Lending segment was $21 million for 2008, down 71.2% compared to 2007. The decline in net income in 2008 was primarily the result of a higher provision for credit losses, which more than offset the increase in net interest income and noninterest income. Net income in 2007 was down $9 million, or 11.0% compared to 2006. Net interest income totaled $501 million in 2008, an increase of 10.6% compared to 2007.

The economic provision for loan and lease losses totaled $301 million in 2008, an increase of $107 million compared to 2007. Comparing 2007 to 2006 the economic provision for loan and lease losses increased $57 million, or 41.6%. Due to the overall higher credit risk profiles of some of the clients of Specialized Lending, loss rates are expected to be higher than conventional bank lending. Loss rates are also affected by shifts in the portfolio mix of the underlying subsidiaries.
Noninterest income produced by the Specialized Lending segment totaled $116 million in 2008, an increase of $26 million, or 28.9%, compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 was largely attributable to growth in revenues from commercial mortgage banking activities. Comparing 2007 to 2006, noninterest income increased $16 million, or 21.6%.

76 Table of Contents Noninterest income produced by the Insurance Services segment totaled $907 million during 2008, an increase of $68 million, or 8.1%, compared to 2007. Internal growth combined with the expansion of BB&Ts insurance agency network and insurance brokerage operations through acquisitions during the last two years were responsible for the growth in noninterest income. Comparing 2007 to 2006, noninterest income increased $56 million, or 7.2%. The growth during 2007 includes the $19 million gain mentioned above. Noninterest expenses incurred within the Insurance Services segment increased $73 million or 11.7%, while allocated corporate expenses increased $14 million, or 50.0%. The overall increase in noninterest expenses within the Insurance Services segment during 2008 principally resulted from the continued expansion of the BB&T insurance agency network. Comparing 2007 to 2006, noninterest expenses and allocated corporate expenses increased slightly, reflecting strong expense control.

Comparing 2007 to 2006, net interest income increased $11 million, or 25.0%. The increase in net interest income during 2008 was largely a result of the Financial Services division focus on growing its corporate banking program, while the increase during 2007 was due to higher FTP credits received by the Financial Services segment.
Noninterest income in the Financial Services segment in 2008 totaled $630 million, up $77 million, or 13.9%, compared to $553 million earned during 2007, which was a slight increase compared to 2006. The revenue increase in 2008 was partially due to strong revenues from investment banking and brokerage operations, as well as increased revenues from the sale of client derivatives. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from trust and investment advisory services. Noninterest expenses incurred by Financial Services in 2008 increased $47 million compared to 2007, after increasing slightly in the prior year. The increase in noninterest expenses in 2008 was largely due to increased personnel costs.

The increase in the provision for income taxes allocated to the Financial Services segment in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily a result of higher pretax income. While pretax income increased 9.2% in 2007 compared to 2006, the provision for income taxes was flat due to a higher level of tax exempt income earned in 2007. Total identifiable segment assets for Financial Services decreased to a total of $2.9 billion at December31, 2008, compared to $4.1 billion at year-end 2007, which were up from $2.2 billion at December31, 2006.

Net interest income for the Treasury segment was $293 million in 2008 compared to an expense of $292 million in 2007. Net interest income for 2008 consisted of $300 million of net interest income and $7 million of expense from the FTP charge. The improvement in net interest income was primarily due to lower funding costs and FTP credits paid on deposits and other funding sources. For 2007, net interest income for the Treasury segment consisted of $134 million of net interest expense and $158 million of expense from the FTP charge. The improvement in net interest income from external sources was primarily due to slower growth in funding costs 77 Table of Contents compared to growth in interest income from investments, while the additional FTP charge resulted from higher credits paid on deposits and other funding sources.
Noninterest income in the Treasury segment is primarily related to BOLI income. During 2008, noninterest income earned by the Treasury segment totaled $140 million, an increase of 26.1%, compared to $111 million earned during 2007.

The provision for income taxes allocated to the Treasury segment during 2008 was an expense of $104 million compared to a benefit of $106 million and $94 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The changes in the tax benefits allocated to the Treasury segment are a combination of changes in the level of pretax income and tax exempt income. Total identifiable assets for the Treasury segment increased $13.3 billion, or 55.1%, in 2008 compared to 2007, following a slight decrease in 2007 compared to 2006. As of December31, 2008, total identifiable assets in the Treasury segment were $37.4 billion. The increase in assets largely reflects the initial deployment of capital related to the CPP.

BB&Ts noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $1.0 billion, up 7.6% from the $942 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The fourth quarter 2008 provision for credit losses increased 187.0% to $528 million, compared to $184 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in the provision for credit losses reflects the deteriorating credit quality of the loan portfolio that has resulted from the distressed residential real estate markets and economic recession. The increase in the provision for credit losses also reflects higher net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.
The fourth quarter 2008 provision for income taxes totaled $25 million, a decrease of $147 million compared to $172 million for the same period of 2007.

BB&Ts internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the Corporations assets; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of BB&Ts management and directors; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporations assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Corporation conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the COSO criteria. Based on this evaluation under the COSO criteria, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the management of the Corporation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporations Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the Corporations disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporations disclosure controls and procedures are effective in enabling the Corporation to record, process, summarize and report, in a timely manner, the information that the Corporation is required to disclose in its Exchange Act reports.
There was no change in the Corporations internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 that has materially affected or is likely to materially affect, the Corporations internal control over financial reporting.
The effectiveness of the internal control structure over financial reporting, as of December31, 2008, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included on page 82, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008.
81 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BB&T Corporation: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing on page xx. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

87 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 NOTE 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General BB&T Corporation (BB&T, the Company or Parent Company) is a financial holding company organized under the laws of North Carolina. BB&T conducts operations through its principal bank subsidiary, Branch Banking and Trust Company (Branch Bank), a federally chartered thrift institution, BB&T Financial, FSB and its nonbank subsidiaries.
The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The following is a summary of BB&Ts more significant accounting policies.
Nature of Operations BB&T is a financial holding company headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. BB&T conducts its operations primarily through Branch Bank, which has branches in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, Alabama, Indiana and Washington, D.C. Branch Bank provides a wide range of banking services to individuals and businesses, and offers a variety of loans to businesses and consumers. Such loans are made primarily to individuals residing in the market areas described above or to businesses located within BB&Ts geographic footprint. Branch Bank also markets a wide range of deposit services to individuals and businesses. Branch Bank offers, either directly, or through its subsidiaries, lease financing to businesses and municipal governments; factoring; discount brokerage services, annuities and mutual funds; life insurance, property and casualty insurance, health insurance and commercial general liability insurance on an agency basis and through a wholesale insurance brokerage operation; insurance premium financing; permanent financing arrangements for commercial real estate; loan servicing for third-party investors; direct consumer finance loans to individuals; and trust services. The direct nonbank subsidiaries of BB&T provide a variety of financial services including automobile lending, equipment financing, full-service securities brokerage, payroll processing, asset management and capital markets services.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of BB&T include the accounts of BB&T Corporation and those subsidiaries that are majority owned by BB&T and over which BB&T exercises control. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The results of operations of companies acquired are included only from the dates of acquisition. All material wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries are consolidated unless accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require otherwise.
BB&T evaluates variable interests in entities for which voting interests are not an effective means of identifying controlling financial interests. Variable interests are those in which the value of the interest changes with the fair value of the net assets of the entity exclusive of variable interests. If the results of the evaluation indicate the existence of a primary beneficiary and the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved, that primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the entity. Likewise, if the evaluation indicates that the requirements for consolidation are not met and the entity has previously been consolidated, then the entity would be deconsolidated.
BB&T has variable interests in certain entities that were not required to be consolidated, including affordable housing partnership interests, historic tax credit partnerships, other partnership interests and trusts that have issued capital securities. Please refer to Note 15 for additional disclosures regarding BB&Ts significant variable interest entities.
88 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) BB&T accounts for unconsolidated partnership investments using the equity method of accounting. In addition to affordable housing partnerships, which represent the majority of unconsolidated investments in variable interest entities, BB&T also has investments and future funding commitments to venture capital and other entities. The maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in variable interest entities is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding balance and any related loans to the entity. Loans to these entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as are other loans and are generally secured.
BB&T has investments in certain entities for which BB&T does not have controlling interest. For these investments, the Company records its interest using the equity method with its portion of income or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. BB&T periodically evaluates these investments for impairment.
Reclassifications In certain instances, amounts reported in prior years consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported cash flows, shareholders equity or net income.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, determination of fair value for financial instruments, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting related adjustments, benefit plan obligations and expenses, and tax assets, liabilities and expense.
Business Combinations BB&T accounts for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the accounts of an acquired entity are included with the acquirers accounts as of the date of acquisition with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) capitalized as goodwill. BB&T typically provides an allocation period not to exceed one year to finalize the purchase price allocations related to its business combinations. Management currently does not anticipate material adjustments to the assigned values of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies.
To consummate an acquisition, BB&T typically issues common stock and / or pays cash, depending on the terms of the merger agreement. The value of common shares issued in connection with purchase business combinations was determined based on the market price of the securities issued over a reasonable period of time, not to exceed three days before and three days after the measurement date.
In connection with mergers and acquisitions, BB&T typically issues options to purchase shares of its common stock in exchange for options outstanding of the acquired entities at the time the merger is completed. To the extent vested, the options are considered to be part of the purchase price paid. There is no change in the aggregate intrinsic value of the options issued compared to the intrinsic value of the options held immediately before the exchange, nor does the ratio of the exercise price per option to the market value per share change.
89 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements. Cash and cash equivalents have maturities of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Securities At date of purchase, BB&T classifies marketable investment securities as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. Interest income and dividends on securities are recognized in interest income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized as an adjustment to interest income using the interest method.
Debt securities acquired with both the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
Debt securities, which may be sold to meet liquidity needs arising from unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes in regulatory capital requirements, or unforeseen changes in market conditions, are classified as available for sale. Equity securities classified as available for sale are primarily stock issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. All other securities available for sale are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income taxes, in the shareholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses realized from the sale of securities available for sale are determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income.
BB&T evaluates each held to maturity and available-for-sale security in a loss position for other-than-temporary impairment. In its evaluation BB&T considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost, the financial condition of the issuer, and BB&Ts ability and intent to hold the security to an expected recovery in market value. Unrealized losses for other-than-temporary impairment on debt and equity securities are recognized in current period earnings.
Trading account securities, which include both debt and equity securities, are reported at fair value. Unrealized market value adjustments, fees, and realized gains or losses from trading account activities (determined by specific identification) are included in noninterest income. Interest income on trading account securities is included in interest and dividends from securities.
Loans Held for Sale Effective January1, 2008, BB&T elected to account for new originations of prime residential mortgage and commercial mortgage loans held for sale at fair value in accordance with Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No.115 , (SFAS No.159 or the Fair Value Option). This option is generally irrevocable. BB&T elected the Fair Value Option for these portfolios of loans held for sale because they are hedged using derivatives and the historical accounting practice resulted in volatility in earnings. Under historical accounting practices, BB&T was required to account for the derivatives at fair value and the loans held for sale at lower of cost or market. This practice resulted in volatility in reported earnings during a declining interest-rate environment because the decline in the value of derivatives held were required to be marked down, but the increasing value of the loans held for sale could not be marked up. Under the Fair Value Option, BB&T recognizes both the loans held for sale and the corresponding derivatives at the full fair value, which will eliminate the mismatch in reported earnings that was caused by the prior accounting practices. BB&T has not elected the Fair Value Option for a small portfolio of its loans held for sale because these loans are not exchanged in an active market and BB&T does not hedge these assets. Fair value 90 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) for loans held for sale is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. Following the adoption of SFAS No.159, direct loan origination fees and costs related to loans held for sale for which the Fair Value Option has been elected are no longer capitalized and recognized in earnings upon the sale of such loans, but rather are recorded as mortgage banking income in the case of the direct loan origination fees and primarily personnel expense in the case of the direct loan origination costs. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking income.
Loans and Leases Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using methods which approximate the interest method. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the loans using methods that approximate the interest method. Commercial loans and substantially all installment loans accrue interest on the unpaid balance of the loans.
Lease receivables consist primarily of investments in leveraged lease transactions and direct financing leases on rolling stock, equipment and real property. Direct financing lease receivables are stated at the total amount of future minimum lease payments receivable plus estimated residual values and initial direct costs, less unearned income. Leveraged leases are also carried net of non-recourse debt. Income is recognized over the lives of the lease contracts using the interest method. BB&T also enters into operating leases as lessor. Operating lease equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to the estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or projected economic life of the equipment. BB&T estimates the residual value at the inception of each lease. In addition, BB&T reviews residual values at least annually, and monitors the residual realizations at the end of the lease term. If the review of the estimated residual values indicates potential impairment and this decline is other than temporary, such impairment is recognized in current period earnings. Estimated residual values are evaluated using information that includes both internal and external appraisals and historical residual realization experience.
BB&T classifies loans and leases past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than 30 days delinquent.
Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets include loans and leases on which interest is not being accrued and foreclosed property. Foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of customers loan defaults. BB&Ts policies related to when loans are placed on nonaccrual status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Commercial loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status when concern exists that principal or interest is not fully collectible, or generally when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due, whichever occurs first. Sales finance loans, revolving credit loans, direct retail loans and mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at varying intervals, based on the type of product, when principal and interest becomes between 90 days and 180 days past due. Specialized lending loans are placed on nonaccrual status generally when principal and interest becomes 90 days past due. Certain loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual status if management determines that it does not have concern over the collectibility of principal and interest. Generally, when loans are placed on nonaccrual status, interest receivable is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as concern exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. Loans and leases are removed from nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and concern no longer exists as to the collectibility of principal and interest.
91 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Cost is determined based on the sum of unpaid principal, accrued but unpaid interest if not required to be reversed and acquisition costs associated with the loan. Any excess of cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Generally, such properties are valued periodically and if the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, a valuation reserve is established. Routine maintenance costs, declines in market value and net losses on disposal are included in other noninterest expense.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments The allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments are managements best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. The Company determines the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments based on an ongoing evaluation. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires material estimates, including the amounts and timing of cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans. Those estimates are susceptible to significant change. Changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made by charges to the provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans or lease balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
The allowance for loan and lease losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on various methodologies. BB&Ts allowance for loan and lease losses consists of (1)a component for individual loan impairment recognized and measured pursuant to SFAS No.114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, (SFAS No.114), and (2)components of collective loan impairment recognized pursuant to SFAS No.5, Accounting for Contingencies, (SFAS No.5) .
BB&T maintains specific reserves for individually impaired loans pursuant to SFAS No.114. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that BB&T will be unable to collect all amounts due (interest as well as principal) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Specific reserves are determined on a loan by loan basis based on managements best estimate of BB&Ts exposure, given the current payment status of the loan, the present value of expected payments and the value of any underlying collateral.
Managements estimate of reserves established pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No.5 for collective impairment reflect losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet reporting date. Embedded loss estimates are based on current migration rates and current risk mix. Embedded loss estimates may be adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio trends including credit quality, concentrations, aging of the portfolio, and significant policy and underwriting changes.
The methodology used to determine the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is inherently similar to that used to determine the SFAS No.5 component of the allowance for loan and lease losses described above, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default.
While management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations.
Premises and Equipment Premises, equipment, capital leases and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Land is stated at cost. In addition, purchased software and costs of computer 92 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) software developed for internal use are capitalized provided certain criteria are met. Depreciation and amortization are computed principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms, including certain renewals which were deemed probable at lease inception, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Capitalized leases are amortized by the same methods as premises and equipment over the estimated useful lives or lease terms, whichever is less. Obligations under capital leases are amortized using the interest method to allocate payments between principal reduction and interest expense. Rent expense and rental income on operating leases is recorded using the straight-line method over the appropriate lease terms.
Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements Securities sold under repurchase agreements generally have maturities ranging from 1 day to 36 months. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the borrowing. The terms of repurchase agreements may require BB&T to provide additional collateral if the fair value of the securities underlying the borrowings declines during the term of the agreement.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes have been provided when different accounting methods have been used in determining income for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future tax consequences attributable to differences arising from the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In the event of changes in the tax laws, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes, with the cumulative effects included in the current years income tax provision.
Derivative Financial Instruments A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. These instruments include interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, financial forwards and futures contracts, swaptions, when-issued securities, foreign exchange contracts and options written and purchased. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk related to securities, business loans, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage banking operations, Federal funds purchased, other time deposits, long-term debt and institutional certificates of deposit. BB&T also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. The fair value of derivatives in a gain or loss position is included in other assets or liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
BB&T classifies its derivative financial instruments as either (1)a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a recorded asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2)a hedge of an exposure to changes in the cash flows of a recognized asset, liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), (3)a hedge of a net investment in a subsidiary, or (4)derivatives not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in current period earnings. BB&T has master netting agreements with the derivatives dealers with which it does business, but reflects gross gains and losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
BB&T uses the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness. BB&T documents, both at inception and over the life of the hedge, at least quarterly, its analysis of actual and expected hedge effectiveness. This analysis includes techniques such as regression analysis and hypothetical derivatives under method 2 of DIG Issue G7 to demonstrate that the hedge has been, and is expected to be, highly effective in off-setting corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges involving interest rate caps and collars, this analysis also includes consideration of the criteria under the response to question 2 of DIG Issue G20. For a qualifying fair value hedge, changes in the value of the derivatives that have been highly effective as hedges are recognized in current period earnings along with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the designated hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For a qualifying cash flow hedge, the portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that have been highly effective are recognized in other comprehensive income until 93 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) the related cash flows from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For qualifying cash flow hedges involving interest rate caps and collars, the initial fair value of the premium paid is allocated and recognized in the same future period that the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings.
For either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, ineffectiveness may be recognized in noninterest income to the extent that changes in the value of the derivative instruments do not perfectly offset changes in the value of the hedged items. If the hedge ceases to be highly effective, BB&T discontinues hedge accounting and recognizes the changes in fair value in current period earnings. If a derivative that qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge is terminated or the designation removed, the realized or then unrealized gain or loss is recognized into income over the original hedge period (fair value hedge) or period in which the hedged item affects earnings (cash flow hedge). Immediate recognition in earnings is required upon sale or extinguishment of the hedged item (fair value hedge) or if it is probable that the hedged cash flows will not occur (cash flow hedge).
Derivatives used to manage economic risk not designated as hedges primarily represent economic risk management instruments of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage banking operations, with gains or losses included in mortgage banking income. In connection with its mortgage banking activities, BB&T enters into loan commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified rates and for specified periods of time. To the extent that BB&Ts interest rate lock commitments relate to loans that will be held for sale upon funding, they are also accounted for as derivatives, with gains or losses included in mortgage banking income. Gains and losses on other derivatives used to manage economic risk are primarily associated with client derivative activity and included in other income.
Per Share Data Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the years presented. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired (including identifiable intangibles) in transactions accounted for as purchases. BB&T allocates goodwill to the business that receives significant benefits from the acquisition. In accordance with provisions of SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized over an estimated useful life, but rather is tested at least annually for impairment. BB&T performs its impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate a possible reduction in the fair value of the business below its carrying value. BB&T measures impairment using the present value of estimated future cash flows. The analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows and discount rates. Discount rates are based upon the cost of capital specific to the industry in which the reporting unit operates. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second analysis is performed to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities. If, based on the second analysis, it is determined that the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, BB&T would recognize impairment for the excess of carrying value over fair value.
Core deposit and other intangible assets include premiums paid for acquisitions of core deposits (core deposit intangibles) and other identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, are amortized based upon the estimated economic benefits received.
Loan Securitizations BB&T securitizes most of its fixed-rate conforming mortgage loans, converts them into mortgage-backed securities issued primarily through the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal 94 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) and sells the resulting securities to third party investors. BB&T records loan securitizations as a sale when the transferred loans are legally isolated from its creditors and the other accounting criteria for a sale are met. Gains or losses recorded on loan securitizations depend in part on the net carrying amount of the loans sold, which is allocated between the loans sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of sale. BB&T generally retains the mortgage servicing on loans sold. Since quoted market prices are not typically available, BB&T estimates the fair value of these retained interests using modeling techniques to determine the net present value of expected future cash flows. Such models incorporate managements best estimates of key variables, such as prepayment speeds and discount rates that would be used by market participants and are appropriate for the risks involved. Gains and losses incurred on loans sold to third party investors are included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
BB&T also periodically securitizes mortgage loans that it intends to hold for the foreseeable future and transfers the resulting securities to the securities available for sale portfolio. This is generally accomplished by exchanging the loans for mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by Freddie Mac. Since the transfers are not considered a sale, no gain or loss is recorded in conjunction with these transactions.
Mortgage Servicing Rights BB&T has two classes of mortgage servicing rights for which it separately manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. Residential mortgage servicing rights are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income each period. Commercial mortgage servicing rights are recorded as other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at lower of cost or market and amortized in proportion to, and over the estimated period that, net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on actual results and updated projections. BB&T periodically evaluates its commercial mortgage servicing rights for impairment.
Equity-Based Compensation BB&T maintains various equity-based compensation plans. These plans provide for the granting of stock options (incentive and nonqualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares to selected BB&T employees and directors. BB&T adopted SFAS No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123(R)), on January1, 2006, using the modified-prospective method, which requires the recognition of compensation costs beginning with the effective date based on (a)the requirements of SFAS No.123(R) for all share-based awards granted after the effective date and (b)the requirements of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No.123), for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No.123(R) that were unvested on the effective date.
Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No.157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.157 clarifies that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS No.157 is required to be applied whenever another financial accounting standard requires or permits an asset or liability to be measured at fair value. SFAS No.157 does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances. BB&T adopted SFAS No.157 effective January1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No.157 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
95 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FSP FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active , (FSP FAS 157-3). FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No.157 in determining the fair value of a financial asset during periods of inactive markets. FSP FAS 157-3 was effective as of September30, 2008 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB reached a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06-4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, (EITF Issue 06-4). In March 2007, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF Issue 06-10, Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, (EITF Issue 06-10). Both of these standards require a company to recognize an obligation over an employees service period based upon the substantive agreement with an employee such as the promise to maintain a life insurance policy or provide a death benefit. BB&T adopted the provisions of these standards effective January1, 2008. The adoption of these EITF issues was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.159, which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Once a company has elected to record eligible items at fair value, the decision is generally irrevocable. The objective of SFAS No.159 is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. BB&T adopted SFAS No.159effective January1, 2008, and elected the fair value option for certain loans held for sale originated on or after January1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No.159 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In November 2007, the SEC Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.109 (SAB No.109) Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value through Earnings , which supersedes the guidance previously issued in SAB No.105 Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments (SAB No.105). SAB No.109 expresses the current view of the Staff that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. The provisions of SAB No.109 affect only the timing of mortgage banking income recognition and are effective for loan commitments entered into on or after January1, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SAB No.109 was not material to BB&Ts consolidated financial statements.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS No.141(R)). SFAS No.141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No.141(R) is effective for BB&T for business combinations entered into on or after January1, 2009.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No.51, (SFAS No.160). SFAS No.160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be accounted for as equity in the consolidated statement of financial position and that net income include the amounts for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest, with a separate amount presented in the income statement for the noncontrolling interest share of net income. SFAS No.160 also expands the disclosure requirements and provides guidance on how to account for changes in the ownership interest of a subsidiary. SFAS No.160 is effective prospectively for BB&T on January1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure provisions which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had $44 million and $32 million, respectively of liabilities related to minority interest that will be reclassed to shareholders equity upon adoption of SFAS No.160. In addition, BB&T recorded $10 million, $12 million and $5 million of expense related to its minority interest during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
96 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of SFAS No.133 , (SFAS No.161). SFAS No.161 requires that an entity provide enhanced disclosures related to derivative and hedging activities. SFAS No.161 is effective for BB&T on January1, 2009.
In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under FASB SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No.142).The intent of FSP FAS 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No.141(R). FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for BB&T on January1, 2009, and applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. The adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities, (FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8). The disclosures required by FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 are intended to provide greater transparency to financial statement users about a transferors continuing involvement with transferred financial assets and an enterprises involvement with variable interest entities and qualifying SPEs. The disclosures required by FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 are included in Note 8 and Note 15 to these consolidated financial statements.
In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, (FSP FAS 132(R)-1). The objectives of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 are to provide users of the financial statements with more detailed information related to the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period, as well as how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. The disclosures about plan assets required by FSP FAS 132(R)-1 are effective for BB&T on December31, 2009.
In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-01, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No.99-20, (FSP EITF 99-20-01). The objective of FSP EITF 99-20-01 is to achieve more consistency in the determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. FSP EITF 99-20-01 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other-than-temporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in FASB Statement No.115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , and other related guidance. The adoption of FSP EITF 99-20-01, which was effective for BB&T on December31, 2008, was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2.Business Combinations Financial Institution Acquisitions On December12, 2008, BB&T announced the acquisition of all the deposits and $61 million in assets of Haven Trust Bank of Duluth, Georgia through an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Haven Trust Bank operated four branches with approximately $506 million in deposits.
On May1, 2007, BB&T completed the acquisition of Coastal Financial Corporation (Coastal), a $1.7 billion bank holding company headquartered in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In conjunction with this transaction, BB&T issued approximately 8.8million shares of common stock and 574thousand stock options valued in the aggregate at $400 million. Including subsequent adjustments, BB&T recorded $246 million in goodwill and $47 million in amortizing intangibles, which are primarily core deposit intangibles.
97 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) On August1, 2006, BB&T completed the acquisition of First Citizens Bancorp (First Citizens), a $700 million bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Tennessee. In conjunction with this transaction, BB&T issued approximately 2.9million shares of common stock and 38thousand stock options valued in the aggregate at $122 million and paid $20 million in cash. Including subsequent adjustments, BB&T recorded $94 million in goodwill and $14 million in amortizing intangibles, which are primarily core deposit intangibles.
On June1, 2006, BB&T completed the acquisition of Main Street Banks Inc. (Main Street), a $2.3 billion bank holding company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. In conjunction with this transaction, BB&T issued approximately 14.3million shares of common stock and 636thousand stock options valued in the aggregate at $621 million. Including subsequent adjustments, BB&T recorded $426 million in goodwill and $43 million in amortizing intangibles, which are primarily core deposit intangibles.
Insurance and Other NonBank Acquisitions During 2008, BB&T acquired eleven insurance businesses and one nonbank financial services company. Including subsequent adjustments, approximately $247 million in goodwill and $152 million of identifiable intangible assets were recorded in connection with these transactions. During 2007, BB&T acquired four insurance agencies and two nonbank financial services companies. Including subsequent adjustments, BB&T recorded approximately $80 million in goodwill and $93 million of identifiable intangibles in connection with these transactions. BB&T also divested one insurance agency during 2007. During 2006, BB&T acquired one insurance agency and two nonbank financial services companies. Including subsequent adjustments, approximately $27 million in goodwill and $14 million of identifiable intangibles were recorded in connection with these transactions.
Merger and acquisition agreements of businesses other than financial institutions occasionally include additional incentives to the acquired entities to offset the loss of future cash flows previously received through ownership positions. Typically, these incentives are based on the acquired entitys contribution to BB&Ts earnings compared to agreed-upon amounts. These amounts will be charged to goodwill based on the terms of the agreement. When offered, these incentives are typically issued for terms of three to five years. As certain provisions of these agreements do not specify dollar limitations, it is not possible to quantify the maximum exposure resulting from these agreements.
Merger-Related and Restructuring Activities BB&T has incurred certain merger-related and restructuring expenses, primarily in connection with business combinations. Merger-related and restructuring expenses or credits include severance and personnel-related costs or credits, which typically occur in corporate support and data processing functions, occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs, and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment, and other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, litigation accruals, and other similar charges. Merger-related and restructuring charges during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $15 million, $21 million and $18 million, respectively.
At December31, 2008 and 2007, there were $24 million and $16 million, respectively, of merger-related and restructuring accruals. In general, a major portion of accrued costs are utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems conversion, when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. Other accruals are utilized over time based on the sale, closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of lease contracts.

100 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) On December31, 2008, BB&T also held certain investment securities having continuous unrealized loss positions for more than 12 months. As of December31, 2008, the unrealized losses on these securities totaled $412 million. Substantially all of these losses were in non-agency mortgage-backed and municipal securities. At December31, 2008, all of the available-for-sale debt securities with the exception of four non-agency mortgage-backed securities were investment grade. During the fourth quarter of 2008, four non-agency mortgage-backed securities, with a book value of approximately $293 million, were downgraded below investment grade. BB&T evaluated all of its non-agency mortgage-backed securities based on the underlying collateral as well as capital structure. BB&T holds the senior position on all of the non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The unrealized losses for all of the securities having continuous unrealized loss positions for more than 12 months are the result of changes in market interest rates and liquidity. Based on the evaluation on December31, 2008, there were no credit losses evident from these securities. At December31, 2008, BB&T had the ability and intent to retain these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover all unrealized losses.

Estimated amortization expense of identifiable intangible assets for each of the next five years total $95 million, $82 million, $70 million, $58 millionand $47 million.
NOTE 8.Loan Servicing BB&T has two classes of mortgage servicing rights for which it separately manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. Commercial mortgage servicing rights are recorded as other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at lower of cost or market and amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows. Residential mortgage servicing rights are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income for each period. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value, due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions, of its residential mortgage servicing rights. The following is an analysis of the activity in BB&Ts residential mortgage servicing rights for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Residential MortgageServicingRights For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Carrying value, January 1, $ 472 $ 484 $ 431 Additions 212 134 94 Purchases  4 18 Increase (decrease) in fair value: Due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions (220 ) (60 ) 21 Other changes (1) (94 ) (90 ) (80 ) Carrying value, December 31, $ 370 $ 472 $ 484 (1) Represents the realization of expected net servicing cash flows, expected borrower payments and the passage of time.
104 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The unpaid principal balances of BB&Ts total residential mortgage servicing portfolio were $59.7 billion, $51.0 billion and $45.2 billion at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The unpaid principal balances of residential mortgage loans serviced for others consist primarily of agency conforming fixed-rate mortgage loans and totaled $40.7 billion, $32.1 billion and $28.2 billion at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in loans on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. BB&T recognized servicing fees of $145 million, $114 million and $102 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a component of mortgage banking income.
During 2008, 2007 and 2006, BB&T sold residential mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances of $13.4 billion, $7.5 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, and recognized pretax gains of $78 million, $12 million and $19 million, respectively, which were recorded in noninterest income as a component of mortgage banking income. BB&T retained the related mortgage servicing rights and receives servicing fees. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the approximate weighted average servicing fee was .37% and .36%, respectively, of the outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans. The weighted average coupon interest rate on the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for others was 6.03% and 6.01% at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
At December31, 2008, BB&T had $822 million of residential mortgage loans sold with limited recourse liability. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, BB&T has maximum recourse exposure of approximately $741 million on these mortgage loans.
BB&T uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights. These assumptions include prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved and comparable to assumptions used by market participants to value and bid servicing rights available for sale in the market. At December31, 2008, the sensitivity of the current fair value of the residential mortgage servicing rights to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in key economic assumptions are included in the accompanying table.
Residential MortgageServicingRights December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Fair Value of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights $ 370 Composition of Residential Loans Serviced for Others: Fixed-rate mortgage loans 98.0 % Adjustable-rate mortgage loans 2.0 Total 100.0 Weighted Average Life 2.6 yrs Prepayment Speed 29.0 % Effect on fair value of a 10% increase $ (27 ) Effect on fair value of a 20% increase (50 ) Weighted Average Discount Rate 9.6 % Effect on fair value of a 10% increase $ (14 ) Effect on fair value of a 20% increase (26 ) The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. As indicated, changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is calculated without changing any other assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments), which may magnify or counteract the effect of the change.
105 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company also has securitized residential mortgage loans and retained the resulting securities available for sale. As of December31, 2008, the fair value of the securities available for sale still owned by BB&T was $591 million and the remaining unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans totaled $573 million. Based on the performance of the underlying loans and general liquidity of the securities, the Companys recovery of the cost basis in the securities has not been significantly impacted by changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or credit losses.
The following table includes a summary of residential mortgage loans managed or securitized and related delinquencies and net charge-offs.

At December31, 2008, 559million common shares were issued and outstanding.
Preferred Stock The authorized preferred stock of BB&T consists of five million shares. BB&T issued 3,133.64 shares of preferred stock, with a $1,000,000 per share liquidation preference, to the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) in connection with the Troubled Asset Relief Programs Capital Purchase Program. The preferred stock pays a dividend of 5%per year for the first five years the preferred stock is outstanding and thereafter pays at a rate of 9%per year. As part of the purchase of the preferred stock, the Treasury Department received a warrant to purchase 13,902,573 shares of BB&Ts common stock at an exercise price of $33.81, which is a component of shareholders equity. The proceeds from the offering of the preferred stock and related warrant were allocated between the preferred stock and warrant based on their relative fair values. The discount attributable to the preferred stock is being amortized over a five-year period. The warrant expires ten years from the issuance date. The agreement with the Treasury Department stipulated that the preferred stock could not be redeemed during the first three years except with proceeds from a qualified equity offering. The warrant agreement also provided that the number of shares in the original warrant would be reduced by one-half if BB&T was able to redeem the preferred stock by December 31, 2009 with proceeds from a qualified equity offering. However, recent legislation allows BB&T to redeem the preferred stock without a qualified equity offering, subject to the approval of its primary federal regulator. If BB&T were to redeem the preferred stock under these provisions, the warrant would be liquidated.
Equity-Based Plans At December31, 2008, BB&T had options, restricted shares and restricted share units outstanding from the following equity-based compensation plans: the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan), the 1995 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan), the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (Directors Plan), and plans assumed from acquired entities, which are described below. All plans generally allow for accelerated vesting of awards for holders who retire and have met all retirement eligibility requirements and in connection with certain other events. BB&Ts shareholders have approved all equity-based compensation plans with the exception of plans assumed from acquired companies. BB&T changed its practices regarding equity-based awards in 2006 and began issuing a combination of restricted share units and nonqualified stock options in connection with its incentive plans. Formerly, the Company had issued substantially all of its equity-based awards in the form of stock options. As of December31, 2008, the 2004 Plan is the only plan that has shares available for future grants.
BB&Ts 2004 Plan is intended to assist the Corporation in recruiting and retaining employees, directors and independent contractors and to associate the interests of eligible participants with those of BB&T and its shareholders. At December31, 2008, there were 17.5million non-qualified and qualified stock options at prices ranging from $8.11 to $50.71 and 6.3million restricted shares and restricted share units outstanding under the 2004 Plan. The options outstanding under the 2004 Plan generally vest ratably over five years and have a ten-year term. The restricted shares and restricted share units generally vest five years from the date of grant. At December31, 2008, there were 10.0million shares available for future grants under the 2004 Plan.
BB&Ts Omnibus Plan was intended to allow BB&T to recruit and retain employees with ability and initiative and to align the employees interests with those of BB&T and its shareholders. At December31, 2008, 5.1million qualified stock options at prices ranging from $11.66 to $47.53 and 18.7million non-qualified stock options at prices ranging from $11.36 to $47.53 were outstanding. The stock options generally vest over 3 to 5 years and have a ten-year term.
The Directors Plan was intended to provide incentives to non-employee directors to remain on the Board of Directors and share in the profitability of BB&T. In 2005, the Directors Plan was amended and no future grants will be awarded in connection with this Plan. At December31, 2008, options to purchase 371thousand shares of common stock at prices ranging from $20.74 to $31.80 were outstanding pursuant to the Directors Plan.
112 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) BB&T also has equity-based plans outstanding as the result of assuming the plans of acquired companies. At December31, 2008, there were 192thousand stock options outstanding in connection with these plans, with option prices ranging from $22.62 to $29.54.
BB&T measures the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants awarded in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively: FortheYearsEndedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 3.7 % 4.7 % 4.6 % Dividend yield 4.5 4.0 3.8 Volatility factor 15.5 14.0 16.0 Expected life 6.9 yrs 6.9 yrs 6.5 yrs Fair value of options per share $ 3.43 $ 5.34 $ 5.58 BB&T determines the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model as follows: the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant; the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of BB&Ts stock, adjusted to reflect the expected dividend yield over the expected life of the option; the volatility factor is based on the historical volatility of BB&Ts stock, adjusted to reflect the ways in which current information indicates that the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past; and the weighted-average expected life is based on the historical behavior of employees related to exercises, forfeitures and cancellations.
BB&T measures the fair value of restricted shares based on the price of BB&Ts common stock on the grant date and the fair value of restricted share units based on the price of BB&Ts common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends that are foregone during the vesting period.
BB&T recorded $75 million, $70 million and $58 million in equity-based compensation in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In connection with this compensation expense, BB&T recorded an income tax benefit of $29 million, $27 million and $22 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised or restricted share units vested during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $20 million, $37 million and $46 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of equity-based awards that vested during 2008 was $43 million. As of December31, 2008, there was $105 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to BB&Ts equity-based awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average life of 3.1 years.

115 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The reasons for the difference between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes were as follows: YearsEndedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Federal income taxes at statutory rate of 35% $ 724 $ 900 $ 866 Increase (decrease) in provision for income taxes as a result of: Addition to federal tax reserves 5 19 141 State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 37 33 31 Federal tax credits (54 ) (34 ) (25 ) Interest on federal tax refunds (66 ) (7 )  Tax exempt income (77 ) (73 ) (62 ) Other, net (19 ) (2 ) (6 ) Provision for income taxes $ 550 $ 836 $ 945 Effective income tax rate 26.6 % 32.5 % 38.2 % BB&T has entered into certain transactions that have favorable tax treatment. These transactions include loans and investments that produce tax-exempt income and tax credits, reducing BB&Ts effective tax rate from the statutory rate. During the fourth quarter of 2008, BB&T agreed to treat its leveraged leases in accordance with the IRSs proposal that, among other things, allows 20% of deductions, imputes interest income and deems the remaining transactions to be terminated as of December31, 2008. As a result of this settlement, BB&T recognized pre-tax interest income of $93 million, or $60 million after-tax, which is reflected as a reduction in tax expense and reduced BB&Ts effective tax rate for 2008. As a result of changes in the timing of tax payments, FSP FAS 13-2 required a recalculation of each transaction that resulted in a $67 million charge to interest income and a corresponding $24 million tax benefit.
The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the table below.

This evaluation takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities examinations of BB&Ts tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment in relation to tax-advantaged transactions. Detailed below is a reconciliation of BB&Ts unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2008 and December31, 2007. The amounts presented in the reconciliation are gross of any related tax benefits.

In addition, the Company had $35 million and $30 million in liabilities for tax-related interest recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total interest, net of the federal benefit, related to unrecognized tax benefits recognized in the 2008 and 2007 Consolidated Statements of Income was $4 million and $12 million, respectively. BB&T classifies interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
117 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The IRS has completed its federal income tax examinations of BB&T through 2006. BB&T has received notification of proposed IRS adjustments related to foreign tax credits claimed by a deconsolidated subsidiary for tax years 2002-2007. Management has consulted with outside counsel and continues to believe that BB&Ts treatment of these issues was appropriate and in compliance with the tax laws and regulations applicable to the years examined and intends to pursue available regulatory and legal remedies to defend BB&Ts position. Management believes the companys current reserves for this matter are adequate, although the final outcome is uncertain. In addition, BB&T may make payments or deposits to the IRS in connection with this matter to stop the accrual of additional interest and penalties, while it pursues resolution. Resolution of this matter is not expected to occur within the next 12 months. BB&T has agreed to settle its dispute with the IRS regarding its leveraged lease transactions. Various years remain subject to examination by state taxing authorities.
NOTE 14.Benefit Plans BB&T provides various benefit plans to substantially all employees, including employees of acquired entities. Employees of acquired entities generally participate in existing BB&T plans after consummation of the business combinations. The plans of acquired institutions are typically merged into the BB&T plans after consummation of the mergers, and, under these circumstances, credit is usually given to these employees for years of service at the acquired institution for vesting and eligibility purposes.
The following table summarizes expenses (income) relating to employee retirement plans: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Defined benefit plans $ 9 $ 32 $ 50 Defined contribution and ESOP plans 76 72 67 Other (38 ) 12 19 Total expense related to retirement benefit plans $ 47 $ 116 $ 136 Defined Benefit Retirement Plans BB&T provides a defined benefit retirement plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code that covers substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service, age at retirement and the employees compensation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings within the last ten years of employment.
In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key officers under supplemental defined benefit executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. Although technically unfunded plans, a Rabbi Trust and insurance policies on the lives of the certain covered employees are available to finance future benefits.
The following are the significant actuarial assumptions that were used to determine net periodic pension costs: December31, 2008 2007 Actuarial Assumptions Weighted average assumed discount rate 6.60 % 6.00 % Weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 8.00 8.00 Assumed rate of annual compensation increases 2009 - 2011 2.50 NA Assumed rate of annual compensation increases thereafter 4.50 4.50 118 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, BB&T considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data for each asset category, as well as historical actual returns on the Companys plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted average expected long-term rate of return for the plan based on target asset allocations contained in BB&Ts Investment Policy Statement.
Financial data relative to the defined benefit pension plans is summarized in the following tables for the years indicated. The qualified pension plan prepaid asset is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of other assets and the nonqualified pension plans accrued liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of other liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December31.

For the nonqualified plans, the accumulated benefit obligation totaled $123 million and $106 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Employer contributions to the qualified pension plan are in amounts between the minimum required for funding standard accounts and the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. Management is not required to make a contribution to the qualified pension plan during 2009; however, management made a contribution of $422 million in early 2009 and may make additional contributions during 2009 if deemed appropriate. For the nonqualified plans the employer contributions are based on benefit payments. The following table reflects the estimated benefit payments reflecting expected future service for the next five years and for the years 2014 through 2018.
Qualified PensionPlan Nonqualified PensionPlans (Dollars in millions) Estimated Benefit Payments 2009 $ 43 $ 7 2010 46 8 2011 49 9 2012 53 9 2013 57 9 2014-2018 345 49 BB&Ts primary total return objective is to achieve returns that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The plan assets have a long-term, indefinite time horizon that runs concurrent with the average life expectancy of the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon that extends well beyond a full market cycle, and can assume an above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard deviation of annual return. It is expected, however, that both professional investment management and sufficient portfolio diversification will smooth volatility and help to generate a reasonable consistency of return. The investments are broadly diversified among economic sector, industry, quality and size in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Within approved guidelines and restrictions, investment managers have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments.
BB&T periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment policy and during 2006 made changes to its target asset allocation. BB&T has established guidelines within each asset category to ensure the appropriate balance of risk and reward. The current target asset allocations for the plan assets include a range of 35% to 45% for U.S. equity securities, 7% to 13% for international equity securities, 20% to 30% for fixed income securities, and 10% to 30% for alternative investments, which include real estate, hedge funds, private equities and commodities, with any remainder to be held in cash equivalents. The allocation of plan assets for the defined benefit pension plans, by asset category as of December31, 2008 and 2007 is detailed in the table below.
December31, Allocation of Plan Assets 2008 2007 U.S. equity securities 44 % 43 % International equity securities 13 13 Fixed income securities 31 31 Alternative investments 9 9 Cash equivalents 3 4 Total 100 % 100 % 121 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The plan assets included 3.540million shares valued at $97 million and 1.033million shares valued at $32 million of BB&T common stock at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, the plan purchased an additional 2.458million shares in a private placement transaction from BB&T for $53 million.
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension BB&T provides certain postretirement benefits. These benefits provide covered employees a subsidy for purchasing health care and life insurance. During 2004, BB&T changed its postretirement benefit to eliminate the subsidy for those employees retiring after December31, 2004. BB&T also reduced the subsidy paid to employees who retired on or before December31, 2004, were age 55 years or older, and had at least ten years of service. For those employees, the subsidy is based upon years of service of the employee at the time of retirement. The effect of the change in subsidy has been accounted for as a plan amendment and reduced the projected benefit obligation by $96 million, which is being amortized as a reduction of benefit costs over approximately 17 years. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the projected benefit obligation was $34 million and $41 million, respectively. There are no plan assets assigned to the plan. Employer contributions to the plan are based on benefit payments. The estimated benefit payments for other postretirement benefits are $5 million, $5 million, $5 million, $4 million and $3 million for the next five years and $13 million for the years 2014 through 2018.
Defined Contribution Plans BB&T offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution plans that permit employees to contribute from 1% to 50% of their cash compensation. For full-time employees who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, BB&T makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employees compensation. BB&Ts contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $73 million, $70 million and $65 million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. BB&T also offers defined contribution plans to certain employees of subsidiaries who do not participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan.
Other There are various other employment contracts, deferred compensation arrangements and covenants not to compete with selected members of management and certain retirees.
NOTE 15.Commitments and Contingencies BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, interest rate caps, floors and collars, interest rate swaps, swaptions, when-issued securities, options written and forward and futures contracts. BB&T also has commitments to fund certain affordable housing investments and contingent liabilities of certain sold loans. The following table presents the contractual or notional amount of these instruments: ContractorNotional Amount at December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollarsinmillions) Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit $ 35,144 $ 34,295 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written 5,861 3,367 Commercial letters of credit 34 41 Financial instruments whose notional or contract amounts exceed the amount of credit risk: Derivative financial instruments 74,177 47,197 Commitments to fund low income housing investments 412 444 Residential mortgage loans sold with recourse 822 170 All other loans sold with recourse 3,259 2,140 122 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit are primarily lines of credit to businesses and consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse change clauses, which allow BB&T to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers creditworthiness.
Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are unconditional commitments issued by BB&T to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had issued $5.9 billion in such guarantees. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and as such, the instruments are collateralized when necessary.
Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for clients and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client.
In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from pending litigation. BB&T also issues standard representation and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to BB&T. Although these agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T.
Merger and acquisition agreements of businesses other than financial institutions occasionally include additional incentives to the acquired entities to offset the loss of future cash flows previously received through ownership positions. Typically, these incentives are based on the acquired entitys contribution to BB&Ts earnings compared to agreed-upon amounts. When offered, these incentives are typically issued for terms of three to five years. As certain provisions of these agreements do not specify dollar limitations, it is not possible to quantify the maximum exposure resulting from these agreements.
Forward commitments to sell mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are contracts for delayed delivery of securities in which BB&T agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values and interest rates.
BB&T invests in certain affordable housing and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area as a means of supporting local communities, and receives tax credits related to these investments. BB&T typically acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. Branch Bank typically provides financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had investments of $891 million and $750 million, respectively, related to these projects, which are included as other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. BB&Ts outstanding commitments to fund affordable housing investments totaled $412 million and $444 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are included as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had outstanding loan commitments of $161 million to these funds, of which $81 million had funded and was included in loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. BB&Ts maximum risk exposure related to these investments totaled $1.1 billion at December31, 2008.
BB&T has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain recourse provisions. These provisions generally require BB&T to reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred after the disposal of the property. At December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had $4.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of loans sold with recourse.
BB&T has investments and future funding commitments to certain venture capital funds. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had investments of $168 million, net of minority interest, related to these ventures and future funding commitments of $222 million. BB&Ts risk exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and future funding commitments made.
123 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) BB&T has made loan commitments to qualified special purpose entities as a nontransferor lender. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had loan commitments to these entities totaling $405 million. Of this amount, $290 million had been funded and was included in loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Legal Proceedings The nature of the business of BB&Ts banking and other subsidiaries ordinarily results in a certain amount of litigation. The subsidiaries of BB&T are involved in various legal proceedings, all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, BB&Ts management believes that the liabilities, if any, arising from these proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of BB&T. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to BB&Ts consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows.
NOTE 16.Regulatory Requirements and Other Restrictions Branch Bank is required by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain reserve balances in the form of vault cash or deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank based on specified percentages of certain deposit types, subject to various adjustments. At December31, 2008, the net reserve requirement amounted to $381 million.
Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, both BB&T and Branch Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. BB&T does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends. In connection with the sale of preferred stock to the Treasury Department under the CPP, BB&T is restricted from increasing its cash dividend to common shareholders above $.47 for three years without the prior approval of the Treasury Department.
BB&T is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatoryand possibly additional discretionaryactions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on BB&Ts financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Corporation must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of BB&Ts assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. BB&Ts capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. BB&T is in full compliance with these requirements. Banking regulations also identify five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T and Branch Bank were classified as well capitalized.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require BB&T to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio).

At December31, 2008 and 2007, Branch Banks equity was above all required levels.
At December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had segregated cash deposits totaling $379 million and $208 million, respectively. These deposits relate to monies held for the exclusive benefit of clients, primarily at BB&Ts broker/dealer subsidiaries.

SFAS No.157 provides a framework for measuring fair value that requires an entity determine fair value based on exit price in the principal market for the asset or liability being measured. Upon adoption, BB&T changed its principal market for measuring the fair value of certain client derivative contracts. The impact of this change on the measurement of fair value for these contracts was $7 million, pre-tax, and was recorded as a decrease in other noninterest income effective January1, 2008.
BB&T also adopted SFAS No.159 effective January1, 2008. SFAS No.159 allows an entity the option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement of certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. This option is generally irrevocable. BB&T elected to adopt fair value for all commercial mortgage loans held for sale and prime residential mortgage loans held for sale originated after December31, 2007. There was no impact to retained earnings as a result of the adoption of SFAS No.159.
The following table details the fair value and unpaid principal balance of loans held for sale at December31, 2008, that were elected to be carried at fair value.

Fair Value Measurements SFAS No.157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received on the measurement date to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly transaction between market participants. SFAS No.157 also establishes a three level fair value hierarchy that describes the inputs that are used to measure assets and liabilities.
Level 1 Level 1 asset and liability fair values are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include certain equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active market.
Level 2 Level 2 asset and liability fair values are based on observable inputs that include: quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted market prices that are not in an active market; or other inputs that are observable in the market and can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include fixed income securities and mortgage-backed securities that are held in the Corporations trading and available-for-sale portfolios, loans held for sale, certain derivative contracts and short-term borrowings.
Level 3 Level 3 assets and liabilities are financial instruments whose value is calculated by the use of pricing models and/or discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as financial instruments for which the determination of 129 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. These methodologies may result in a significant portion of the fair value being derived from unobservable data. Level 3 assets and liabilities include certain trading securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, venture capital investments and certain derivative contracts.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including financial instruments for which BB&T has elected the Fair Value Option are summarized below: Fair Value Measurements for Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis As of December31, 2008 Quoted Prices in ActiveMarketsfor Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other ObservableInputs (Level 2) Significant UnobservableInputs (Level 3) (Dollars in millions) Assets: Trading securities $ 376 $ 204 $ 168 $ 4 Securities available for sale 32,843 170 31,574 1,099 Loans held for sale (1) 1,396  1,396  Residential mortgage servicing rights 370   370 Derivative assets (2) 1,723 4 1,681 38 Venture capital investments (2) 183  1 182 Total assets $ 36,891 $ 378 $ 34,820 $ 1,693 Liabilities: Derivative liabilities (2) $ 1,097 $ 11 $ 1,085 $ 1 Short-term borrowed funds (3) 149  149  Total liabilities $ 1,246 $ 11 $ 1,234 $ 1 (1) Loans held for sale are residential and commercial mortgage loans that were originated subsequent to December 31, 2007 for which BB&T elected the fair value option under SFAS No. 159. Loans originated prior to January 1, 2008 and certain other loans held for sale are still accounted for at the lower of cost or market. There were $28 million in loans held for sale that are not accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2008.

The table below presents a reconciliation for the year ended December31, 2008, for all Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

These transfers were almost entirely non-agency mortgage-backed securities for which there has been very limited sales activity. Certain assumptions regarding market liquidity for the valuation of these securities could not be reliably observed. These assumptions represent a more than nominal component of fair value. There was no gain or loss recognized in earnings at the time of the transfer of the non-agency mortgage-backed securities to level 3.
The table below summarizes unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings for Level 3 assets and liabilities for the year ended December31, 2008.

BB&T uses various derivative financial instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to its quarterly valuation. During 2008, the derivative instruments produced gains of $262 million, which offset the negative valuation adjustment recorded.
Also, BB&T may be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the year ended December31, 2008 that were still held on the balance sheet at December31, 2008 totaled $1.3 billion. This amount consists of $740 million for impaired loans and $538 million for foreclosed real estate that were classified as Level 3 assets. During the year ended December31, 2008, BB&T recorded $142 million and $22 million, respectively, in losses related to write-downs of the loans and the foreclosed real estate based on the appraised value of the underlying collateral.
SFAS No.107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (SFAS No.107), requires the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments. A financial instrument is defined as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity or a contract that creates a contractual obligation or right to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity. BB&T has recorded certain assets and liabilities at fair value as required by SFAS No.157, and those assets for which BB&T elected the Fair Value Option.

Fair values are calculated based on the value of one trading unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument, possible tax ramifications, estimated transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or the relationship between various financial instruments. No readily available market exists for a significant portion of BB&Ts financial instruments. Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, currency and interest rate risk characteristics, loss experience and other factors. Many of these estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. In addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these fair value estimates. The following methods and assumptions were used by BB&T in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments.
132 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Cash and cash equivalents and segregated cash due from banks : For these short-term instruments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair values.
Loans receivable and loans held for sale: The fair values for loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms and credit quality. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair values. The fair values of loans held for sale for which BB&T did not elect the Fair Value Option are based on quoted market prices and the projected value of the net servicing fees.
Deposit liabilities: The fair values for demand deposits, interest-checking accounts, savings accounts and certain money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date, i.e., their carrying amounts. Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current interest rates to aggregate expected maturities.
Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and short-term borrowed funds : The carrying amounts of Federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements and short-term borrowed funds approximate their fair values.
Long-term debt: The fair values of long-term debt are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on BB&Ts current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.
Contractual commitments: The fair values of commitments are estimated using the fees charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair values also consider the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are estimated based on the counterparties creditworthiness and average default rates for loan products with similar risks. The fair values of commitments to fund affordable housing investments are estimated using the net present value of future commitments.
NOTE 19.Derivative Financial Instruments The following tables set forth certain information concerning BB&Ts derivative financial instruments at December31, 2008 and 2007: Derivative Financial Instruments December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Notional Amount Estimated Fair Value Notional Amount Estimated Fair Value (Dollars in millions) Receive fixed swaps (includes forward starting) $ 18,302 $ 1,284 $ 14,890 $ 336 Pay fixed swaps (includes forward starting) 18,387 (857 ) 7,492 (171 ) Other swaps 6,803 7 5,457 (10 ) Caps, floors and collars 1,187  3,650 16 Foreign exchange contracts 684 1 227  Futures contracts 7,154 (7 ) 8,690 (3 ) Treasury forwards   10  Interest rate lock commitments 4,239 33 1,203 2 Forward commitments 4,820 (44 ) 2,028 (10 ) Swaptions 5,163 115 1,741 21 When-issued securities and forward rate agreements 6,883 87 1,703  Options on contracts purchased and sold 555 7 106  Total $ 74,177 $ 626 $ 47,197 $ 181 133 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following tables disclose data with respect to BB&Ts derivative financial instrument classifications and hedging relationships: Derivative Classifications and Hedging Relationships December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Gain Loss Gain Loss (Dollars in millions) Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges: Hedging business loans $ 1,250 $ 45 $  $ 2,119 $ 20 $  Hedging overnight and short-term funding 4,100 6 (31 ) 1,750  (14 ) Hedging 3 Month LIBOR funding 3,755 6 (39 ) 2,934  (8 ) Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges: Hedging long-term debt 4,160 585  8,300 148 (6 ) Hedging municipal securities 354  (150 ) 446  (33 ) Hedging certificates of deposit 357 15     Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges: Hedging foreign exchange 73  (1 )    Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 60,128 1,066 (876 ) 31,648 241 (167 ) Total $ 74,177 $ 1,723 $ (1,097 ) $ 47,197 $ 409 $ (228 ) At December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had designated notional values of $4.9 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, of derivatives as fair value hedges. At December31, 2008, fair value hedges reflected a net unrealized gain of $450 million, with instruments in a gain position reflecting a fair value of $600 million recorded in other assets and instruments in a loss position with a fair value of $150 million recorded in other liabilities. At December31, 2007, derivatives designated as fair value hedges reflected a net unrealized gain of $109 million, composed of instruments in a gain position with a fair value of $148 million and instruments in a loss position with a fair value of $39 million. BB&T terminated a fair value hedge related to its long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and received proceeds of $266 million. The proceeds from this termination were included in cash flows from financing activities and the related gain is being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. The impact on earnings resulting from fair value hedge ineffectiveness was a loss of $10 million during 2008 and a loss of $2 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively.
At December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had designated derivatives with notional values of $9.1 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, as cash flow hedges. These instruments were in a net loss position of $13 million and $2 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impact on earnings resulting from the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was a loss of $1 million during 2008 and was not material for 2007 and 2006, respectively.
BB&Ts floating rate business loans, Federal funds purchased, institutional certificates of deposit, other time deposits, medium term bank notes and long term debt expose it to variability in cash flows for interest payments. The risk management objective for these assets and liabilities is to hedge the variability in the interest payments. This objective is met by entering into interest rate swaps, and interest rate collars and caps. Interest rate collars and caps fix the interest payments when interest rates on the hedged item exceed predetermined rates. Accumulated other comprehensive income included $73 million and $14 million in unrecognized after-tax gains on interest rate swaps, caps, floors and collars hedging variable interest payments on business loans at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts included unrecognized after-tax gains on terminated swaps, caps and collars of $45 million and $7 million at December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, respectively. In addition, accumulated other comprehensive income included $28 million and $14 million in net unrecognized after-tax losses on interest rate swaps, caps and floors hedging variable interest payments on short-term funding at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts included unrecognized after-tax gains on terminated 134 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) hedges of $11 million and unrecognized after-tax losses of $3 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Also included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December31, 2008 are unrecognized after-tax gains of $3 million on terminated interest rate swaps hedging variable interest payments on long term debt.
The estimated net amount in accumulated other comprehensive income at December31, 2008 that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a net after-tax loss of $9 million. The amount reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income during 2008 and 2007 was a net after-tax gain of $61 million and $5 million, respectively. During 2006, the amount reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income was not material.
All of BB&Ts cash flow hedges are hedging exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on then existing financial instruments. The maximum length of time over which BB&T is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to variable interest payments is 7.4 years.
BB&T also held $60.1 billion and $31.6 billion in notional value of derivatives not designated as hedges at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December31, 2008 and 2007, these instruments were in a net gain position with a net estimated fair value of $190 million and $74 million, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are reflected in current period earnings. Derivatives not designated as a hedge in the notional amounts of $25.1 billion and $9.4 billion have been entered into as risk management instruments for mortgage servicing rights and mortgage banking operations at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For mortgage loans originated for sale, BB&T is exposed to changes in market rates and conditions subsequent to the interest rate lock and funding date. BB&Ts economic hedge strategy related to its interest rate lock commitment derivatives and loans held for sale includes utilizing mortgage-based derivatives such as forward commitments and options in order to mitigate market risk. At December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, BB&T held derivatives not designated as hedges with notional amounts totaling $9.3 billion and $6.4 billion that have been entered into to facilitate transactions on behalf of BB&Ts clients. BB&T also held derivatives not designated as hedges with notional amounts totaling $25.7 billion and $15.8 billion at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as risk management instruments primarily related to client derivatives, balance sheet management and capital markets activities.
Credit risk related to derivatives arises when amounts receivable from a counterparty exceed those payable. Because the notional amount of the instruments only serves as a basis for calculating amounts receivable or payable, the risk of loss with any counterparty is limited to a small fraction of the notional amount. BB&T controls the risk of loss by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required to provide cash collateral to BB&T when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, BB&T had received cash collateral of approximately $165 million and $75 million, respectively. In addition, BB&T had posted collateral of $180 million and $8 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December31, 2008, BB&T had approximately $59 million of unsecured positions with derivative dealers. All of the derivative contracts to which BB&T is a party settle monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In the case of contracts with derivative dealers, BB&T only transacts with dealers that are national market makers whose credit ratings are strong. Further, BB&T has netting agreements with the dealers with which it does business. Because of these factors, BB&Ts credit risk exposure related to derivatives contracts at December31, 2008 and 2007 was not material.

In addition, BB&T had a warrant outstanding for 13.9million shares as of December31, 2008 that was antidilutive.
NOTE 21.Operating Segments BB&Ts operations are divided into seven reportable business segments: the Banking Network, Residential Mortgage Banking, Sales Finance, Specialized Lending, Insurance Services, Financial Services, and Treasury. These operating segments have been identified based on BB&Ts organizational structure. The segments require unique technology and marketing strategies and offer different products and services. While BB&T is managed as an integrated organization, individual executive managers are held accountable for the operations of these business segments.
BB&T measures and presents information for internal reporting purposes in a variety of different ways. The internal reporting system presently used by management in the planning and measuring of operating activities, as well as the system to which most managers are held accountable, is based on organizational structure.
BB&T emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client service, sales effectiveness and relationship management. The segment results contained herein are presented based on internal management accounting policies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles. The performance of the segments is not comparable with BB&Ts consolidated results or with similar information presented by any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities.
The management accounting process uses various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the operating segments. To determine financial performance for each segment, BB&T allocates capital, funding charges and credits, an economic provision for loan and lease losses, certain noninterest expenses and income tax provisions to each segment, as applicable. Also, to promote revenue growth and provide a basis 136 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) for employee incentives, certain revenues of Residential Mortgage Banking, Sales Finance, Specialized Lending, Insurance Services, Financial Services and other segments are reflected in the individual segment results and also allocated to the Banking Network. This double counting of revenue is reflected in intersegment net referral fees and eliminated to arrive at consolidated results. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic adjustment as the internal management accounting system is revised and business or product lines within the segments change. Also, because the development and application of these methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically revised.
BB&Ts overall objective is to maximize shareholder value by optimizing return on equity and managing risk. Allocations of capital and the economic provision for loan and lease losses are designed to address this objective. Capital is assigned to each segment on an economic basis, using managements assessment of the inherent risks associated with the segment. Capital allocations are made to cover the following risk categories: credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, option risk, basis risk, market risk and operational risk. Each segment is evaluated based on a risk-adjusted return on capital. Capital assignments are not equivalent to regulatory capital guidelines, and the total amount assigned to all segments typically varies from total consolidated shareholders equity.
The economic provision for loan and lease losses is also allocated to the relevant segments based on managements assessment of the segments risks as described above. Unlike the provision for loan and lease losses recorded pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, the economic provision adjusts for the impact of expected credit losses over the effective lives of the related loans and leases. Any over or under allocated provision for loan and lease losses is reflected in Parent/Reconciling Items to arrive at consolidated results.
BB&T allocates expenses to the reportable segments based on various methodologies, including volume and amount of loans and deposits and the number of full-time equivalent employees. A portion of corporate overhead expense is not allocated, but is retained in corporate accounts and reflected as Parent/Reconciling Items in the accompanying tables. Income taxes are allocated to the various segments based on taxable income and statutory rates applicable to the segment.
BB&T utilizes a funds transfer pricing (FTP) system to eliminate the effect of interest rate risk from the segments net interest income because such risk is centrally managed within the Treasury segment. The FTP system credits or charges the segments with the economic value or cost of the funds the segments create or use. The FTP system provides a funds credit for sources of funds and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The net FTP credit or charge, which includes intercompany interest income and expense, is reflected as net funds transfer pricing in the accompanying tables.
Early in 2009, management evaluated its allocation methodologies for the economic provision for loan and lease losses and FTP given the deterioration in the loan portfolio and the dislocation in the LIBOR rate during 2008. Based on this evaluation, management updated its allocations of the economic provision for loan and lease losses and FTP to reflect these events that occurred in 2008. The 2008 results presented in the three-year comparative table reflect the updated methodologies for the economic provision for loan and lease losses and FTP. In addition, a separate presentation of the 2008 results based on the prior methodologies has been provided.
Banking Network BB&Ts Banking Network serves individual and business clients by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and other financial services. The Banking Network is primarily responsible for serving client relationships, and, therefore, is credited with revenue from the Residential Mortgage Banking, Financial Services, Insurance Services, Specialized Lending, Sales Finance and other segments, which is reflected in net referral fees. Amortization and depreciation expense that has been allocated to the segment totaled $82 million, $86 million and $88 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
137 Table of Contents BB&T CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Residential Mortgage Banking The Residential Mortgage Banking segment retains and services mortgage loans originated by the Banking Network as well as those purchased from various correspondent originators. Mortgage loan products include fixed- and adjustable-rate government and conventional loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. Substantially all of the properties are owner occupied. BB&T generally retains the servicing rights to all loans sold. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment earns interest on loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, fee income from the origination and servicing of mortgage loans and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans. The Banking Network receives an intersegment referral fee for the origination of loans and servicing rights, with a portion of the corresponding charge incurred by the Residential Mortgage Banking segment and the remaining charge incurred in the corporate office, which is reflected as part of Parent/Reconciling Items in the accompanying tables. Amortization and depreciation expense that has been allocated to the segment was not material for any of the years presented.
Sales Finance BB&Ts Sales Finance segment primarily originates loans to consumers for the purchase of automobiles. Such loans are originated on an indirect basis through approved franchised and independent automobile dealers throughout the BB&T market area. Sales Finance also originates loans for the purchase of boats and recreational vehicles originated through dealers in BB&Ts market area. In addition, Sales Finance also provides financing to dealers for their inventories. The Banking Network receives an intersegment referral fee for servicing the loans originated by the Sales Finance segment with the corresponding charge remaining in the Sales Finance segment. Amortization and depreciation expense that has been allocated to the segment was not material for any of the years presented.
Specialized Lending BB&Ts Specialized Lending segment consists of six business units that provide specialty finance alternatives to consumers and businesses including: dealer-based financing of equipment for both small businesses and consumers, equipment leasing, direct consumer finance, insurance premium finance, indirect sub-prime automobile finance, and full-service commercial mortgage banking. Bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and outside BB&Ts primary geographic market area are served by these companies. The Banking Network receives credit for referrals to these companies with the corresponding charge retained in the corporate office, which is reflected as part of Parent/Reconciling Items in the accompanying tables. Amortization and depreciation expense that has been allocated to the segment totaled $28 million, $23 million and $17 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Insurance Services BB&T operates the 6 th largest insurance agency/brokerage network in the nation. BB&T Insurance Services provides property and casualty, life and health insurance to businesses and individuals. It also provides small business and corporate products, such as workers compensation and professional liability, as well as surety coverage and title insurance.
