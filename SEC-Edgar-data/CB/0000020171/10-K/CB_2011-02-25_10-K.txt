ITEM 1.  BUSINESS  GENERAL       The Chubb Corporation (the Corporation) was incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of the State of New Jersey in June 1967. The Corporation is a holding company with subsidiaries principally engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. The Corporation and its subsidiaries employed approximately 12,400 persons worldwide on December 31, 2000.       In July 1999, the Corporation completed its acquisition of Executive Risk Inc., a specialty insurance company offering directors and officers, errors and omissions and professional liability coverages. The results of operations of Executive Risk are included in the Corporation's consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Additional information related to the Corporation's acquisition of Executive Risk is included in Note (3) of the notes to consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference from the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders.       Revenues, income before income tax and assets for each operating segment for the three years ended December 31, 2000 are included in Note (16) of the notes to consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference from the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders.       The property and casualty insurance subsidiaries provide insurance coverages principally in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and parts of Latin America and the Far East. Revenues of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries by geographic area for the three years ended December 31, 2000 are included in Note (16) of the notes to consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference from the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE       The principal members of the Property and Casualty Insurance Group (the Group) are Federal Insurance Company (Federal), Pacific Indemnity Company (Pacific Indemnity), Vigilant Insurance Company (Vigilant), Great Northern Insurance Company (Great Northern), Chubb Custom Insurance Company (Chubb Custom), Chubb National Insurance Company (Chubb National), Chubb Indemnity Insurance Company (Chubb Indemnity), Chubb Insurance Company of New Jersey (Chubb New Jersey), Texas Pacific Indemnity Company, Northwestern Pacific Indemnity Company, Executive Risk Indemnity Inc. (Executive Risk Indemnity), Executive Risk Specialty Insurance Company (Executive Risk Specialty) and Quadrant Indemnity Company (Quadrant) in the United States, as well as Chubb Insurance Company of Canada, Chubb Insurance Company of Europe, S.A., Chubb Insurance Company of Australia Limited, Chubb do Brasil Companhia de Seguros and Chubb Atlantic Indemnity Ltd.       Federal is the manager of Vigilant, Pacific Indemnity, Great Northern, Chubb National, Chubb Indemnity, Chubb New Jersey, Executive Risk Indemnity, Executive Risk Specialty and Quadrant. Federal also provides certain services to other members of the Group. Acting subject to the supervision and control of the Boards of Directors of the members of the Group, the Chubb & Son division of Federal provides day to day executive management and operating personnel and makes available the economy and flexibility inherent in the common operation of a group of insurance companies.       The Group presently underwrites most lines of property and casualty insurance. All members of the Group write non-participating policies. Several members of the Group also write participating policies, particularly in the workers' compensation class of business, under which dividends are paid to the policyholders.                                          2 3    Premiums Written       An analysis of the Group's premiums written during the past three years is shown in the following table: DIRECT         REINSURANCE      REINSURANCE          NET                                        PREMIUMS         PREMIUMS         PREMIUMS          PREMIUMS                                         WRITTEN        ASSUMED(A)        CEDED(A)          WRITTEN YEAR                                   --------        -----------      -----------        --------                                                               (IN MILLIONS) 1998..........................         $5,842.0          $141.9           $480.4           $5,503.5 1999..........................          6,042.6           275.2            616.7            5,701.1 2000..........................          6,741.6           384.4            792.8            6,333.2 ---------------      (a) Intercompany items eliminated.       The net premiums written during the last five years for major classes of the Group's business are incorporated by reference from page 20 of the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders.       One or more members of the Group are licensed and transact business in each of the 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Canada, Europe, Australia, and parts of Latin America and the Far East. In 2000, approximately 82% of the Group's direct business was produced in the United States, where the Group's businesses enjoy broad geographic distribution with a particularly strong market presence in the Northeast. The four states accounting for the largest amounts of direct premiums written were New York with 13%, California with 10% and New Jersey and Texas each with 5%. No other state accounted for 5% or more of such premiums. Approximately 9% of the Group's direct premiums written was produced in Europe and 3% was produced in Canada.    Underwriting Results       A frequently used industry measurement of property and casualty insurance underwriting results is the combined loss and expense ratio. This ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred losses and related loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders. When the combined ratio is under 100%, underwriting results are generally considered profitable; when the combined ratio is over 100%, underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable. Investment income, other non-underwriting income or expense and income taxes are not reflected in the combined ratio. The profitability of property and casualty insurance companies depends on income from both underwriting operations and investments.       The net premiums and the loss, expense and combined loss and expense ratios of the Group for the last five years are shown in the following table: NET PREMIUMS                                          COMBINED                                        (IN MILLIONS)                                          LOSS AND                                    ----------------------                      EXPENSE         EXPENSE                                                                 LOSS           RATIOS          RATIOS YEAR                                WRITTEN      EARNED        RATIOS          -------        -------- 1996.............................  $ 4,773.8    $ 4,569.3         66.2%           32.1%            98.3% 1997.............................    5,448.0      5,157.4         64.5            32.4             96.9 1998.............................    5,503.5      5,303.8         66.3            33.5             99.8 1999.............................    5,701.1      5,652.0         70.3            32.5            102.8 2000.............................    6,333.2      6,145.9         67.5            32.9            100.4                                    ---------    ---------      -------         -------        ---------  Total for five years ended    December 31, 2000.............  $27,759.6    $26,828.4         67.1%           32.7%            99.8%                                    =========    =========      =======         =======        ========= The combined loss and expense ratios during the last five years for major classes of the Group's business are incorporated by reference from page 20 of the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders.                                          3 4       Another frequently used measurement in the property and casualty insurance industry is the ratio of statutory net premiums written to policyholders' surplus. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, such ratio for the Group was 1.82 and 1.76, respectively.    Producing and Servicing of Business       In the United States and Canada, the Group is represented by approximately 5,000 independent agents and accepts business on a regular basis from an estimated 1,000 insurance brokers. In most instances, these agents and brokers also represent other companies which compete with the Group. The offices maintained by the Group assist these agents and brokers in producing and servicing the Group's business. In addition to the administrative offices in Warren, New Jersey, the Group has seven zone offices and branch and service offices throughout the United States and Canada.       The Group's overseas business is developed by its foreign agents and brokers through local branch offices of the Group and by its United States and Canadian agents and brokers. In conducting its overseas business, the Group reduces the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which the Group transacts business, with characteristics similar to the liabilities in those currencies. The net asset or liability exposure to the various foreign currencies is regularly reviewed.       Business for the Group is also produced through participation in certain underwriting pools and syndicates. Such pools and syndicates provide underwriting capacity for risks which an individual insurer cannot prudently underwrite because of the magnitude of the risk assumed or which can be more effectively handled by one organization due to the need for specialized loss control and other services.    Reinsurance       In accordance with the normal practice of the insurance industry, the Group assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurers or reinsurers. Reinsurance is ceded to provide greater diversification of business and minimize the Group's maximum net loss arising from large risks or from hazards of potential catastrophic events.       A large portion of the Group's reinsurance is effected under contracts known as treaties under which all risks meeting prescribed criteria are automatically covered. Most of the Group's treaty reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss and catastrophe contracts with other insurers or reinsurers which protect against a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event. In certain circumstances, reinsurance is also effected by negotiation on individual risks. The amount of each risk retained by the Group is subject to maximum limits which vary by line of business and type of coverage. Retention limits are continually reviewed and are revised periodically as the Group's capacity to underwrite risks changes. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Group of its primary obligation to the policyholders.       The existing reinsurance program of the Executive Risk insurance subsidiaries at the time of the acquisition was designed to limit the loss retained from a loss occurrence to an amount lower than that typically retained by the Group. Prior to the acquisition, Executive Risk utilized reinsurance to a greater extent because its size limited the amount of risk it could retain. During 2000, Executive Risk's reinsurance program was modified to selectively increase retention levels.       The collectibility of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers. The Group is selective in regard to its reinsurers, placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers with strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability. The Group monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers on an ongoing basis. As a result, uncollectible amounts have not been significant.       The Group has an exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, windstorms and other catastrophic events. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure                                          4 5  in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event. The Group continually assesses its concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develops strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection, subject to regulatory constraints, and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. The Group uses modeling techniques and concentration management tools that allow it to better monitor and control catastrophe exposures. The Group maintains records showing concentrations of risk in catastrophe prone areas such as California (earthquake and brush fires) and the Southeast coast of the United States (hurricanes). The Group's current catastrophe reinsurance program provides coverage for individual catastrophic events of approximately 80% of losses between $100 million and $450 million in the United States and approximately 90% of losses between $25 million and $175 million outside the United States.    Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses and Related Amounts Recoverable from Reinsurers       Insurance companies are required to establish a liability in their accounts for the ultimate costs (including claim adjustment expenses) of claims that have been reported but not settled and of claims that have been incurred but not reported. Insurance companies are also required to report as assets the portion of such liability that will be recovered from reinsurers.       The process of establishing the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is a complex and imprecise science that reflects significant judgmental factors. This is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions, changing legislative, judicial and social environments and changes in the Group's claim handling procedures. In many liability cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the Group and the settlement of the loss. More than 60% of the Group's net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses at December 31, 2000 were for incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses--claims that had not yet been reported to the Group, some of which were not yet known to the insured, and future development on reported claims. In spite of this imprecision, financial reporting requirements dictate that insurance companies report a single amount as the estimate of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses as of each evaluation date. These estimates are continually reviewed and updated. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operating results.       The Group's estimates of losses for reported claims are established judgmentally on an individual case basis. Such estimates are based on the Group's particular experience with the type of risk involved and its knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim. These estimates are reviewed on a regular basis or as additional facts become known. The reliability of the estimation process is monitored through comparison with ultimate settlements.       The Group's estimates of losses for unreported claims are principally derived from analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year for each class of business. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. For certain classes of business where anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and/or erratic claim severity patterns, the Group's estimates are based on both expected and actual reported losses. Salvage and subrogation estimates are developed from patterns of actual recoveries.       The Group's estimates of unpaid claim adjustment expenses are based on analyses of the relationship of projected ultimate claim adjustment expenses to projected ultimate losses for each class of business. Claim staff has discretion to override these expense formulas where judgment indicates such action is appropriate.       The Group's estimates of reinsurance recoverable related to reported and unreported claims and claim adjustment expenses represent the portion of such liabilities that will be recovered from reinsurers. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are recognized as assets at the same time and in a manner consistent with the liabilities associated with the reinsured policies.                                          5 6       The anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. Estimates of the ultimate value of all unpaid claims are based in part on the development of paid losses, which reflect actual inflation. Inflation is also reflected in the case estimates established on reported open claims which, when combined with paid losses, form another basis to derive estimates of reserves for all unpaid claims. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the adequacy of the consideration given to inflation, since claim settlements are affected by many factors.       The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverable, and a reconciliation of the ending net liability to the corresponding liability on a gross basis for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31                                                     -----------------------------------                                                       2000         1999         1998                                                       ----         ----         ----                                                                (IN MILLIONS) Net liability, beginning of year..................  $ 9,748.8    $ 9,049.9    $ 8,564.6                                                     ---------    ---------    --------- Increase related to acquisition of Executive Risk   (net of reinsurance recoverable of $339.5)......         --        605.8           --                                                     ---------    ---------    --------- Net incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses   Provision for claims occurring in the current      year.........................................    4,357.7      4,147.6      3,712.1   Decrease in estimates for claims occurring in      prior years..................................

This compares with favorable development of $205.6 million and $218.4 million during 1999 and 1998, respectively. Such redundancies were reflected in the Group's operating results in these respective years. Each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim experience for certain liability classes; this was offset in part by losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims of $31.0 million, $46.8 million and $67.8 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.       Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverable, increased by $302.5 million or 3% in 2000, $698.9 million or 8% in 1999 and $485.3 million or 6% in 1998. The increase in 1999 includes $605.8 million of net reserves assumed upon the acquisition of Executive Risk. The 1999 increase would have been $548.7 million greater except that loss reserves were reduced by payments in that amount during the year related to the settlement of asbestos-related claims against Fibreboard Corporation. Excluding the effect of the Executive Risk reserves assumed and the Fibreboard payments, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverable, increased by $641.8 million or 7% in 1999. Reserve growth has occurred each year in those liability classes that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement. These coverages represent a significant portion of the Group's business. The Group continues to emphasize early and accurate reserving, inventory management of claims and suits, and control of the dollar value of settlements. The number of outstanding claims at year-end 2000 was approximately 9% lower than the number at year-end 1999, which was in turn flat compared with year-end 1998.                                          6 7       The uncertainties relating to unpaid claims, particularly for asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago, are discussed in Item 7 of this report on pages 19 through 22.       The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverable, related to asbestos and toxic waste claims for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. Reinsurance recoveries related to such claims are not significant.

The method by which asbestos claims are established by the Group's claim staff was changed in 1998. Previously, claims were generally established for each lawsuit. Since the change was implemented in 1998, one master claim is generally established for all similar claims and lawsuits involving an insured. Prior year claim counts were not adjusted to conform to the new methodology. A counted claim can have from one to thousands of claimants. Management does not believe the following claim count data is meaningful for analysis purposes.       There were approximately 1,100 asbestos claims outstanding at December 31, 2000 compared with 1,600 asbestos claims outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 2,000 asbestos claims outstanding at December 31, 1998. In 2000, approximately 200 claims were opened and 700 claims were closed. In 1999, approximately 200 claims were opened and 600 claims were closed. In 1998, approximately 500 claims were opened and 2,200 claims were closed, including claims "closed" to adjust the data base to the methodology implemented in 1998. Indemnity payments per claim have varied over time due primarily to variations in insureds, policy terms and types of claims. Management cannot predict whether indemnity payments per claim will increase, decrease or remain the same.       There were approximately 650 toxic waste claims outstanding at December 31, 2000 compared with 600 toxic waste claims outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 650 toxic waste claims outstanding at December 31, 1998. Approximately 500 claims were opened in 2000, 300 claims were opened in 1999 and 250 claims were opened in 1998. There were approximately 450 claims closed in 2000, 350 claims closed in 1999 and 400 claims closed in 1998. Generally, a toxic waste claim is established for each lawsuit, or alleged equivalent, against an insured where potential liability has been determined to exist under a policy issued by a member of the Group. Because indemnity payments to date for toxic waste claims have not been significant in the aggregate and have varied from claim to claim, management cannot determine whether past claims experience will prove to be representative of future claims experience.       The table on page 9 presents the subsequent development of the estimated year-end liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the ten years prior to 2000. The amounts in the table for the years ended December 31, 1990 through 1998 do not include Executive Risk's unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to the Group.       The upper section of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded net liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate is increased or                                          7 8  decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for each individual year. The increase or decrease is reflected in the current year's operating results. The "cumulative deficiency (redundancy)" as shown in the table represents the aggregate change in the reserve estimates from the original balance sheet dates through December 31, 2000. The amounts noted are cumulative in nature; that is, an increase in a loss estimate that related to a prior period occurrence generates a deficiency in each intermediate year. For example, a deficiency recognized in 2000 relating to losses incurred prior to December 31, 1990 would be included in the cumulative deficiency amount for each year in the period 1990 through 1999. Yet, the deficiency would be reflected in operating results only in 2000. The effect of changes in estimates of the liabilities for claims occurring in prior years on income before income taxes in each of the past three years is shown in the reconciliation table on page 6.       In each of the years 1990 through 1999, there was favorable development for certain liability classes as the result of favorable loss experience. In each of these years, this favorable development was offset, in varying degrees, by unfavorable development related to asbestos and toxic waste claims. The years 1990 through 1992 in particular reflect the effects of the $675 million increase in loss reserves related to the Fibreboard settlement. The cumulative net deficiencies experienced relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were also, to varying degrees, the result of: (1) an increase in the actual number of claims filed; (2) an increase in the number of unasserted claims estimated; (3) an increase in the severity of actual and unasserted claims; and (4) an increase in litigation costs associated with such claims.       Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses in the past will not necessarily recur in the future. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on the data in this table.       The middle section of the table on page 9 shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the reestimated liability as of the end of each succeeding year. For example, in the 1990 column, as of December 31, 2000 the Group had paid $4,188.0 million of the currently estimated $5,036.9 million of claims and claim adjustment expenses that were unpaid at the end of 1990; thus, an estimated $848.9 million of losses incurred through 1990 remain unpaid as of December 31, 2000, approximately half of which relates to asbestos and toxic waste claims.       The lower section of the table on page 9 shows the gross liability, reinsurance recoverable and net liability recorded at each year-end beginning with 1992 and the reestimation of these amounts as of December 31, 2000. Amounts for years prior to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts, have not been presented.                                          8 9             ANALYSIS OF CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT DECEMBER 31

The main objectives in managing the investment portfolio of the Group are to maximize after-tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations. To accomplish this, the investment function must be highly integrated with the operating functions and capable of responding to the changing conditions in the marketplace. Investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and the Group's resulting tax position, regulatory requirements, fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks.       The investment portfolio of the Group is primarily comprised of high quality bonds, principally tax-exempt, U.S. Treasury, government agency, mortgage-backed securities and corporate issues. In addition, the portfolio includes equity securities held primarily with the objective of capital appreciation.       In 2000, the Group invested new cash primarily in mortgage-backed securities. In 1999, the Group invested new cash primarily in tax-exempt bonds and corporate bonds. In 1998, the Group invested new cash primarily in tax-exempt bonds and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. In each year, the Group tried to achieve the appropriate mix in its portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies. At December 31, 2000, 67% of the Group's fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax-exempt bonds compared with 70% at December 31, 1999 and 71% at December 31, 1998.       The investment results of the Group for each of the past three years are shown in the following table.

The Real Estate Group is involved in commercial development activities primarily in New Jersey and residential development activities primarily in central Florida.       The Real Estate Group owns approximately $325 million of land, which is expected to be developed in the future, and approximately $190 million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease. The Real Estate Group is continuing to explore the sale of certain of its remaining properties. Additional information related to the Corporation's real estate operations is included in Item 7 of this report on page 23.  REGULATION, PREMIUM RATES AND COMPETITION       The Corporation is a holding company with subsidiaries primarily engaged in the property and casualty insurance business and is therefore subject to regulation by certain states as an insurance holding company. All states have enacted legislation which regulates insurance holding company systems such as the Corporation and its subsidiaries. This legislation generally provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the department of insurance of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to the insurance commissioners is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any person in its holding company system and, in addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the commissioners' prior approval.       The Group is subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which it does business. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. The extent of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to a department of insurance. The regulation, supervision and administration relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; restrictions on insurance policy terminations; unfair trade practices; the nature of and limitations on investments; premium rates; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other purposes; limitations on dividends to policyholders and shareholders; and the adequacy of provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, both reported and unreported, and other liabilities.       The extent of insurance regulation on business outside the United States varies significantly among the countries in which the Group operates. Some countries have minimal regulatory requirements, while others regulate insurers extensively. Foreign insurers in many countries are faced with greater restrictions than domestic competitors. In certain countries, the Group has incorporated insurance subsidiaries locally to improve its position.       The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has a risk-based capital requirement for property and casualty insurance companies. The risk-based capital formula is used by state regulatory authorities to identify insurance companies which may be undercapitalized and which merit further regulatory attention. The formula prescribes a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company, based on the profile of the individual company. The ratio of a company's actual policyholders' surplus to its minimum capital requirement will determine whether any state regulatory action is required. At December 31, 2000, each member of the Group had more than sufficient capital to meet the risk-based capital requirement.                                          11 12       Regulatory requirements applying to premium rates vary from state to state, but generally provide that rates not be "excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory." Rates for many lines of business, including automobile and homeowners insurance, are subject to prior regulatory approval in many states. However, in certain states, prior regulatory approval of rates is not required for most lines of insurance which the Group underwrites. Ocean marine insurance rates are exempt from regulation.       Subject to regulatory requirements, the Group's management determines the prices charged for its policies based on a variety of factors including claim and claim adjustment expense experience, inflation, tax law and rate changes, and anticipated changes in the legal environment, both judicial and legislative. Methods for arriving at prices vary by type of business, exposure assumed and size of risk. Underwriting profitability is affected by the accuracy of these assumptions, by the willingness of insurance regulators to approve changes in those rates which they control and by such other matters as underwriting selectivity and expense control.       The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to price and service. Members of the Group compete not only with other stock companies but also with mutual companies, other underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. Some competitors obtain their business at a lower cost through the use of salaried personnel rather than independent agents and brokers. Rates are not uniform for all insurers and vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation. The Group competes for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service, including claim adjustment service. The Group's products and services are generally designed to serve specific customer groups or needs and to offer a degree of customization that is of value to the insured.       There are approximately 3,000 property and casualty insurance companies in the United States operating independently or in groups and no single company or group is dominant. According to A.M. Best, the Group is the 13th largest United States property and casualty insurance group based on 1999 net premiums written. The relatively large size and underwriting capacity of the Group provide opportunities not available to smaller companies.       The property and casualty marketplace, particularly the standard commercial lines, which include multiple peril, casualty and workers' compensation, experienced severe price competition from the late 1980s through most of the 1990s. As a result, price levels throughout the industry for many of these coverages fell to inadequate levels. In late 1998, the Group put in place a strategy to increase the pricing in the standard commercial lines and to not renew underperforming accounts where it could not attain price adequacy. The Group's prices for standard commercial coverages have increased steadily and such increases accelerated in 2000. Many of the Group's competitors have also insisted on higher prices since the latter part of 1999. Pricing in the specialty commercial lines and personal lines remains competitive. The Group continues to work closely with its customers and to reinforce with them the stability, expertise and added value the Group provides.       In all states, insurers authorized to transact certain classes of property and casualty insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund. In the event of the insolvency of a licensed insurer writing a class of insurance covered by the fund in the state, members are assessed to pay certain claims against the insolvent insurer. Generally, fund assessments are proportionately based on the members' written premiums for the classes of insurance written by the insolvent insurer. In certain states, a portion of these assessments is recovered through premium tax offsets and policyholder surcharges. In 2000, assessments to the members of the Group amounted to approximately $8 million. The amount of future assessments cannot be reasonably estimated.       State insurance regulation requires insurers to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations, which are mechanisms that generally provide applicants with various basic insurance coverages when they are not available in voluntary markets. Such mechanisms are most prevalent for automobile and workers' compensation insurance, but a majority of states also mandate participation in Fair Plans or Windstorm Plans, which provide basic property coverages. Some states also require insurers to participate in facilities that provide homeowners and                                          12 13  crime insurance. Participation is based upon the amount of a company's voluntary written premiums in a particular state for the classes of insurance involved. These involuntary market plans generally are underpriced and produce unprofitable underwriting results.       In several states, insurers, including members of the Group, participate in market assistance plans. Typically, a market assistance plan is voluntary, of limited duration and operates under the supervision of the insurance commissioner to provide assistance to applicants unable to obtain commercial and personal liability and property insurance. The assistance may range from identifying sources where coverage may be obtained to pooling of risks among the participating insurers.       Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways. Current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect the insurance business include natural disaster reinsurance, hazardous waste removal and liability measures, tort reform, containment of medical costs, automobile safety, ergonomics, patients' rights, privacy, e-commerce, international trade, financial services deregulation and the taxation of insurance companies.       Insurance companies are also affected by a variety of state and federal legislative and regulatory measures as well as by decisions of their courts that define and extend the risks and benefits for which insurance is provided. These include redefinitions of risk exposure in areas such as product liability and commercial general liability as well as extension and protection of employee benefits, including workers' compensation and disability benefits.       Legislative and judicial developments pertaining to asbestos and toxic waste exposures are discussed in Item 7 of this report on pages 19 through 22.  ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES       The executive offices of the Corporation and the administrative offices of the Property and Casualty Insurance Group are in Warren, New Jersey. The Property and Casualty Insurance Group maintains zone administrative and branch offices in major cities throughout the United States and also has offices in Canada, Europe, Australia, the Far East and Latin America. Office facilities are leased with the exception of buildings in Branchburg, New Jersey and Simsbury, Connecticut. Management considers its office facilities suitable and adequate for the current level of operations. See Note (14) of the notes to consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference from the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders.  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       As previously reported, a purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on August 31, 2000 by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. The complaint alleges that the Corporation and three of its current officers, Dean R. O'Hare, David B. Kelso and Henry B. Schram, and Executive Risk Inc. and three of its former officers, Stephen J. Sills, Robert H. Kullas and Robert V. Deutsch, are liable for certain misrepresentations and omissions regarding, among other matters, disclosures made between April 27, 1999 and October 15, 1999 relating to the improved pricing in the Corporation's standard commercial insurance business and relating to the offer of the Corporation's securities to, and solicitation of votes from, the former shareholders of Executive Risk Inc. in connection with the Corporation's acquisition of Executive Risk Inc. The Corporation is defending the action vigorously.       The Corporation and its subsidiaries are also defendants in various lawsuits arising out of their businesses. It is the opinion of management that the final outcome of these matters will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the registrant.       Information regarding certain litigation to which property and casualty insurance subsidiaries of the Corporation are a party is included in Item 7 of this report on pages 19 through 22.                                          13 14  ITEM 4.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion presents our past results and our expectations for the near term future. The supplementary financial information and the consolidated financial statements and related notes, all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of our results and our financial position, are incorporated by reference from the Corporation's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders, pages 19, 20 and 42 through 63.       Certain statements in this document, as well as certain statements incorporated by reference herein, may be considered to be "forward looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements that include the words or phrases "will likely result", "are expected to", "will continue", "is anticipated", "estimate", "project", or similar expressions. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by any such statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed or identified from time to time in the Corporation's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and specifically to: risks or uncertainties associated with the Corporation's expectations with respect to its market risk evaluations or with respect to announced real estate plans or rate increases and investment income or cash flow projections and, more generally, to: general economic conditions including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets, changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations and taxes, changes in competition and pricing environments, regional or general changes in asset valuations, the occurrence of significant natural disasters, the inability to reinsure certain risks economically, the adequacy of loss reserves, as well as general market conditions, competition, pricing and restructurings. Any forward-looking statements set forth in this document speak only as of the initial Securities and Exchange Commission filing date hereof.       Operating income, which excludes realized investment gains and losses, was $681 million in 2000 compared with $565 million in 1999 and $615 million in 1998. Operating income in 1998 reflects a first quarter restructuring charge of $26 million after taxes related to the implementation of a cost control initiative.       Net income, which includes realized investment gains and losses, was $715 million in 2000 compared with $621 million in 1999 and $707 million in 1998.  ACQUISITION OF EXECUTIVE RISK INC.       In July 1999, The Chubb Corporation (Corporation) completed its acquisition of Executive Risk Inc., a specialty insurance company offering directors and officers, errors and omissions and professional liability coverages.       Executive Risk shareholders received 1.235 shares of the Corporation's common stock for each outstanding common share of Executive Risk. In addition, outstanding Executive Risk stock options were assumed and adjusted as options to purchase common stock of the Corporation. Approximately 14.3 million shares of common stock of the Corporation were issued to Executive Risk shareholders                                          15 16  and an additional 1.8 million shares of common stock of the Corporation were reserved for issuance upon exercise of the assumed Executive Risk stock options.       The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Therefore, the results of operations of Executive Risk are included in the Corporation's consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. The assets and liabilities of Executive Risk were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The value of the stock options assumed by the Corporation was included in the purchase price. The total purchase price was approximately $832 million. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, amounting to approximately $517 million, has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over 26 years.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE       Property and casualty income before taxes was $803 million in 2000 compared with $626 million in 1999 and $685 million in 1998. The higher earnings in 2000 were due primarily to an improvement in underwriting results, caused in large part by substantially lower catastrophe losses compared with the prior year. The decrease in earnings in 1999 was due to deterioration in underwriting results caused in large part by the effect of inadequate prices resulting from the prolonged soft market on our standard commercial results, which include multiple peril, casualty and workers' compensation, and, to a lesser extent, higher catastrophe losses compared with 1998. Investment income increased in both 2000 and 1999 compared with the respective prior years.       Catastrophe losses were $72 million in 2000, $225 million in 1999 and $173 million in 1998. The 1998 amount was net of reinsurance recoveries of approximately $130 million related to Hurricane Georges. We did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during 2000 or 1999 since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention. Our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately $100 million in the United States and generally $25 million outside the United States.       Reported net premiums written amounted to $6.3 billion in 2000, an increase of 11% compared with 1999. Reported net premiums written increased 4% in 1999 compared with 1998. Premium growth in 2000 and 1999 was affected by the inclusion of Executive Risk written premiums since the date of acquisition. Excluding the effect of the acquisition of Executive Risk, premium growth was 8% in 2000 and 1% in 1999.       Personal coverages accounted for $1.7 billion or 27% of 2000 net premiums written, standard commercial coverages for $1.8 billion or 28% and specialty commercial coverages for $2.8 billion or 45%.       Premium growth in personal lines was strong in both 2000 and 1999. In commercial lines, competition in the worldwide marketplace has made profitable premium growth difficult. However, our strategy, begun in late 1998, to increase the pricing in the standard commercial classes and to not renew underperforming accounts where we could not attain price adequacy has shown increasing success throughout 1999 and 2000. Further, many of our competitors have also insisted on higher prices since the latter part of 1999. As a result, the pricing outlook in the standard commercial classes continues to be favorable.       Substantial premium growth was achieved in 2000 and 1999 outside the United States, particularly in Europe, our largest foreign market. Non-U.S. premiums grew 16% and 12% in 2000 and 1999, respectively, in original currency. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly in 2000, reported non-U.S. premiums increased by only 9% in 2000 and 10% in 1999.       Underwriting results were near breakeven in 2000 compared with unprofitable results in 1999 and near breakeven results in 1998. The combined loss and expense ratio, the common measure of underwriting profitability, was 100.4% in 2000 compared with 102.8% in 1999 and 99.8% in 1998.       The loss ratio was 67.5% in 2000 compared with 70.3% in 1999 and 66.3% in 1998. Losses from catastrophes represented 1.2 percentage points of the loss ratio in 2000 compared with 4.0 percentage                                          16 17  points in 1999 and 3.3 percentage points in 1998. Catastrophe losses affecting results in 2000 and 1999 resulted primarily from weather-related events in the United States, including in particular Hurricane Floyd in the third quarter of 1999. The 1998 catastrophe losses resulted primarily from the winter ice storms in Canada in the first quarter, the wind and hail storms in the United States in the second quarter and Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico in the third quarter.       Our expense ratio was 32.9% in 2000 compared with 32.5% in 1999 and 33.5% in 1998. The increase in the expense ratio in 2000 was due to overhead expenses growing at a somewhat higher rate than written premiums. The lower expense ratio in 1999 compared with the prior year was due to salary and overhead expenses decreasing due to a cost control initiative discussed below and a change in accounting that has resulted in the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use that were previously expensed.       During 1998, we implemented an activity value analysis process that identified and eliminated low-value activities and improved operational efficiency while redirecting resources to activities having the greatest potential to contribute to the Corporation's results. The cost control initiative resulted in job reductions through a combination of early retirements, terminations and attrition. Other savings resulted from improved vendor management and lower consulting expenses and other operating costs. In the first quarter of 1998, we recorded a restructuring charge of $40 million related to the implementation of the initiative. The majority of the charge consisted of accruals for providing enhanced pension benefits and postretirement medical benefits to employees who accepted an early retirement incentive offer. The liabilities related to these enhanced benefits have been included in the pension and postretirement medical benefits liabilities and are being reduced as benefit payments are made over time. All of the other restructuring costs have been paid. The initiative was completed with no significant differences from the original estimates of the restructuring costs.  PERSONAL INSURANCE       Our personal insurance business continued to produce exceptionally strong results in 2000, measured by both growth and profitability.       Net premiums from personal insurance increased 13% in 2000 compared with a 12% increase in 1999. We continued to grow our personal lines business with the in-force policy count for all coverages increasing significantly. For most coverages, such growth exceeded 10% each year. Growth has been achieved while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection.       Personal lines premiums outside the United States grew significantly in 2000 and 1999, although from a small base. Much of this growth was in Europe where rates are inadequate. Remedial actions are under way to improve the profitability of this business.       Our personal insurance business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the past three years. The combined loss and expense ratio was 92.9% in 2000 compared with 89.9% in 1999 and 85.6% in 1998.       Homeowners results were near breakeven in 2000 compared with profitable results in 1999 as a decrease in catastrophe losses was more than offset by an unusually high number of large non-catastrophe losses in 2000, particularly in the first half of the year. Homeowners results in 1999 were less profitable than in 1998 due to an increase in both catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe losses. Results in 1999 were also adversely affected by two large losses aggregating $15 million, net of reinsurance. Catastrophe losses represented 7.3 percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in 2000 compared with 11.8 percentage points in 1999 and 8.5 percentage points in 1998. Homeowners results were unprofitable in Europe in each of the past three years as rates are inadequate and we are still building the critical mass necessary to absorb the costs of operating that franchise.       Our personal automobile business produced substantial profits in each of the last three years. However, results in 2000 were less profitable due to an increase in the frequency of losses in the liability component of this business. Results in each year benefited from stable loss severity.                                          17 18       Other personal coverages, which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability, were highly profitable in each of the past three years, as favorable loss experience has continued.  STANDARD COMMERCIAL INSURANCE       Net premiums from standard commercial insurance decreased 3% in 2000 compared with an 8% decrease in 1999. The decrease in premiums in both years was the result of the strategy we put in place in late 1998 to renew good business at adequate prices and not renew underperforming business where we cannot attain price adequacy. As a result, retention levels declined during 1999 and 2000. On the business that has renewed, however, rates have increased steadily and such increases accelerated in 2000. The market remains firm and shows no signs of weakening.       Our standard commercial insurance business produced substantial underwriting losses in each of the past three years, but showed improvement in 2000. The improvement was due primarily to fewer large losses as well as the progress made on our initiative to increase prices while not renewing unprofitable accounts. The combined loss and expense ratio was 114.0% in 2000 compared with 123.6% in 1999 and 118.0% in 1998.       Rates are still inadequate. Underpriced business will continue to put pressure on standard commercial underwriting results in 2001. We will continue to push for higher rates in 2001.       Multiple peril results were unprofitable in each of the past three years due, in large part, to inadequate prices. However, such results showed significant improvement in 2000. The improvement occurred in both the property and liability components of this business due to a lower frequency of large losses in both the United States and overseas. Results in the property component also benefited from an absence of catastrophe losses. Results had deteriorated in 1999 compared with the prior year due to an increase in the severity of liability losses as well as several large property losses overseas. There were virtually no catastrophe losses for this class in 2000. Catastrophe losses represented 9.6 percentage points of the loss ratio in 1999 and 8.6 percentage points in 1998.       Results for our casualty business were unprofitable in each of the past three years. Results in 2000 were similar to those in 1999, as improvement in the primary liability component was offset by further deterioration in the automobile component. In 1999, casualty results had deteriorated, primarily in these two components. Casualty results in each of the past three years were adversely affected by incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims. The excess liability component of our casualty coverages was modestly unprofitable in 2000 and 1999 compared with the near breakeven results in 1998 due to increases in the severity of the large losses that are prevalent in this class as well as declining prices over the past several years. Excess liability results in each of the past three years benefited from favorable development of prior year loss reserves. Results for the primary liability component were unprofitable in each of the past three years, but more so in 1999 due to a higher frequency of large losses. Primary and excess liability results outside the United States deteriorated in 2000. Results in the automobile component were increasingly unprofitable over the past three years due in large part to inadequate prices, a consequence of the prolonged soft market, and an increased frequency of losses. Results in 2000 were also adversely affected by uninsured motorist claims in Ohio, the result of a state supreme court decision that the uninsured and underinsured motorists coverages of commercial automobile insurance policies also cover employees and their family members even when they are driving their personal cars for non-business purposes.       Workers' compensation results were near breakeven in 2000 compared with results that were similarly unprofitable in 1999 and 1998. The improvement in 2000 was due to higher rates as well as a lower frequency of losses, resulting in part from our disciplined risk selection during the past two years.  SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL INSURANCE       Reported net premiums from specialty commercial insurance increased by 21% in 2000 compared with a 9% increase in 1999. Excluding the effect of the acquisition of Executive Risk, premium growth was about 14% in 2000 and 4% in 1999.                                          18 19       Our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to bring new products to market and differentiate such products continue to enable us to renew a large percentage of our executive protection and financial institutions business. Excluding the effect of the Executive Risk acquisition, executive protection and financial institutions premiums increased in 2000 by 10% and 24%, respectively, substantial improvements over the 1999 growth. However, a competitive market continues to put prices under pressure, particularly for our executive protection business. Growth in our financial institutions business was particularly strong in 2000 due to new business as well as rate increases on the standard commercial component of this business.       Growth in property and marine premiums in 1999 and 2000 was restricted by the effect on retention levels of pricing initiatives and non-renewing certain unprofitable accounts. Growth in our other specialty commercial business was primarily from Chubb Re, our reinsurance business that began operations in 1999.       Our specialty commercial underwriting results were highly profitable in each of the last three years. The combined loss and expense ratio was 95.9% in 2000 compared with 93.6% in 1999 and 91.5% in 1998.       Property and marine results remained highly unprofitable over the past three years. The positive effect of the pricing initiative and the culling of unprofitable accounts was offset in 1999 by higher catastrophe losses and in 2000 by significantly higher losses overseas. Results in all three years were adversely affected by a high frequency of large property losses. Catastrophe losses for this class represented 1.7 percentage points of the loss ratio in 2000 compared with 10.2 percentage points in 1999 and 5.7 percentage points in 1998.       Executive protection results were profitable in each of the past three years on business worldwide due to favorable development of prior year loss reserves, particularly in the directors and officers and fiduciary liability components. However, we have been seeing a narrowing of profit margins over the three most recent accident years from the levels we experienced before that. As a result, we have begun a rate initiative and we are analyzing our book of business. We are focusing in particular on our employment practices liability business, which has been unprofitable.       Our financial institutions business was also profitable in each of the last three years due to favorable loss experience in the fidelity component of this business. The standard commercial business written on financial institutions produced breakeven results in 2000 compared with unprofitable results in 1999 and profitable results in 1998.       Our other commercial classes produced unprofitable results in 2000 compared with profitable results in 1999 and near-breakeven results in 1998. Our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years. However, such results were less profitable in 2000 due primarily to one $15 million loss, net of reinsurance. Aviation results were highly unprofitable in each of the past three years.  LOSS RESERVES       Loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries' largest liability. At the end of 2000, gross loss reserves totaled $11.9 billion compared with $11.4 billion and $10.4 billion at year-end 1999 and 1998, respectively. Reinsurance recoverable on such loss reserves was $1.9 billion at year-end 2000 compared with $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion at the end of 1999 and 1998, respectively. The 2000 and 1999 gross loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable include amounts related to Executive Risk. Executive Risk has historically utilized reinsurance to a greater extent because its size limited the amount of risk it could retain.       Loss reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, increased by $302 million or 3% in 2000 compared with $699 million or 8% in 1999. The increase in 1999 included $606 million of net reserves assumed upon the acquisition of Executive Risk. The 1999 increase would have been $549 million greater except that loss reserves were reduced by payments in that amount during the year related to the settlement of asbestos-related claims against Fibreboard Corporation. Excluding the Executive Risk reserves                                          19 20  assumed and the Fibreboard payments, loss reserves increased 7% in 1999. Reserve growth each year has occurred primarily in those liability classes that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement.       During 2000, we experienced overall favorable development of $230 million on loss reserves established as of the previous year-end. This compares with favorable development of $206 million in 1999 and $218 million in 1998. Such redundancies were reflected in operating results in these respective years. Each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim experience for certain liability classes, offset in part by losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims.       The process of establishing loss reserves is a complex and imprecise science that reflects significant judgmental factors. This is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions, changing legislative, judicial and social environments and changes in our claim handling procedures. In many liability cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the loss. In fact, more than 60% of our net loss reserves at December 31, 2000 were for incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses -- claims that had not yet been reported to us, some of which were not yet known to the insured, and future development on reported claims.       Judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments. As a result of this and other societal and economic developments, the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience continue to further complicate the already complex loss reserving process.       The uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions and judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.       Asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure. In the past year, the continued flow of claims pushed about a half-dozen manufacturers and users of asbestos products into bankruptcy. To date, approximately 25 major companies have filed for bankruptcy as a result of asbestos liability. In part as a result of these bankruptcies, the volume and value of claims against viable asbestos defendants continue to increase.       Our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve traditional defendants who manufactured, distributed or installed asbestos products for whom we wrote excess liability coverages. While these insureds are relatively few in number, such exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims, the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants.       Our other asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants, including a mix of manufacturers, distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners. Generally, these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis. As the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted, plaintiffs are targeting these peripheral parties with greater frequency and, in many cases, for larger awards. In addition, the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings. Class actions are then initiated even though many of the claimants have not manifested evidence of serious injury. Thus, new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that practically all manufacturing and usage of asbestos ended nearly two decades ago. Based on published projections, we expect that we will continue receiving asbestos claims at the current rate for at least the next several years.       The expanded focus of asbestos litigation beyond asbestos manufacturers and distributors to installers and premises owners has created in some instances conflicts among insureds, primary                                          20 21  insurers and excess insurers, primarily involving questions regarding allocation of indemnity and expense costs and exhaustion of policy limits. These issues are generating costly coverage litigation with the potential for inconsistent results.       A legislative solution to the asbestos claim litigation is being pursued by some insurers, including Chubb, and major corporate defendants. Any such solution would require the support of members of the plaintiffs bar. The new administration coupled with the rash of recent bankruptcies may create the best opportunity for such a legislative solution.       Significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to asbestos related claims due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims as well as the increase in the volume of claims by plaintiffs claiming exposure but with no symptoms of asbestos-related disease.       Hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure. Under the federal "Superfund" law and similar state statutes, when potentially responsible parties (PRPs) fail to handle the clean-up at a site, regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the PRPs. Most PRPs named to date are parties who have been generators, transporters, past or present land owners or past or present site operators. The PRPs, with proper government authorization in many instances, disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site. Most sites have multiple PRPs. Insurance policies issued to PRPs were not intended to cover the clean-up costs of pollution and, in many cases, did not intend to cover the pollution itself. Pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written. In more recent years, however, policies specifically exclude such exposures.       As the costs of environmental clean-up have become substantial, PRPs and others have increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers. Litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability, coverage and other policy provisions.       There is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims. First, the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate. At any given site, the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the PRPs varies greatly depending on a variety of factors. Second, different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues. These significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future.       Uncertainties also remain as to the Superfund law itself. Superfund's taxing authority expired on December 31, 1995. It has not been re-enacted. Notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution that would reform the liability provisions of the law, federal legislation appears to be at a standstill. It is currently not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take, when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry.       Without federal movement on Superfund reform, the enforcement of Superfund liability is shifting to the states. States are being forced to reconsider state-level cleanup statutes and regulations. As individual states move forward, the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater. Significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites. Because of the large number of state sites, such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than Superfund sites.       Toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends. In many cases, claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to various factors, including more efficient site remediation efforts. However, litigation remains a serious problem.       Litigation costs remain substantial, particularly for hazardous waste claims. Primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not limit defense costs. This unlimited defense provided in the policies sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs substantially exceeding the indemnity exposure. A substantial portion of the funds we have expended to date has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues.                                          21 22       Reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors. We have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy. In addition, IBNR reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims. These reserves are continually reviewed and updated. Incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were $31 million in 2000, $47 million in 1999 and $68 million in 1998. Further increases in loss reserves in 2001 and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning these claims continue to be clarified. The amount cannot be reasonably estimated.       Management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred, including both those known to us and those yet to be reported. In establishing such reserves, management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation. However, given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future, particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims, as well as some continuing uncertainty in determining what scientific standards will be deemed acceptable for measuring hazardous waste site clean-up, additional increases in loss reserves may emerge which would adversely affect results in future periods. The amount cannot reasonably be estimated at the present time.  CATASTROPHE EXPOSURE       The Corporation's property and casualty subsidiaries have an exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, windstorms and other catastrophic events. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event. We continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection, subject to regulatory constraints, and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. In recent years, we have invested in modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control catastrophe exposures. We also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence, including the impact of global climate change, that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies.  INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY       Investment income after taxes increased 6% in 2000 compared with 1999 and 9% in 1999 compared with 1998. The growth was due in part to an increase in invested assets, which reflected strong cash flow from operations over the period. Growth in both years was also due in part to the inclusion of Executive Risk investment income since the date of acquisition. Excluding the effect of the acquisition of Executive Risk, growth was about 3% in 2000 and 5% in 1999. The effective tax rate on our investment income was 16.4% in 2000 compared with 15.7% in 1999 and 15.3% in 1998. The effective tax rate fluctuates each year as a result of changes in the percentage of our portfolio invested in tax-exempt bonds.       Generally, premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums. These funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments. The balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio. Historically, cash receipts from operations, consisting of insurance premiums and investment income, have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses, operating expenses and dividends to the Corporation.       New cash available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately $560 million in 2000 compared with $940 million in 1999 and $860 million in 1998. New cash available in 2000 was lower than in 1999 and 1998 due primarily to higher paid losses in 2000 caused in large part by significantly higher payments on directors and officers liability and excess liability claims compared                                          22 23  with previous years. New cash available in 1999 was not affected by the Fibreboard-related payments during the year since such payments were made from an escrow account that was funded in 1993.       In 2000, we invested new cash primarily in mortgage-backed securities. In 1999, new cash was invested in tax-exempt bonds and corporate bonds. Also, during 1999, we reduced our equity securities portfolio by approximately $350 million with $145 million of the proceeds used to fund the purchase of a 28% interest in Hiscox plc, a U.K. personal and commercial specialty insurer. In 1998, new cash was invested primarily in tax-exempt bonds and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. In each year, we tried to achieve the appropriate mix in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies.       The property and casualty subsidiaries maintain sufficient investments in highly liquid, short-term securities at all times to provide for immediate cash needs, and the Corporation maintains bank credit facilities that are available to respond to unexpected cash demands.  CORPORATE AND OTHER       Corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets, interest expense and other expenses not allocable to the operating subsidiaries, and the results of our real estate and other non-insurance subsidiaries. Corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of $4 million in both 2000 and 1999 compared with income of $23 million in 1998. The losses in 2000 and 1999 were primarily due to increasingly higher interest expense each year, due to the inclusion of interest expense on the debt assumed in connection with the Executive Risk acquisition in July 1999. In 2000, corporate and other included income of $10 million from a noncompete payment related to the sale of the Corporation's 50% interest in Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc. (AAU).  REAL ESTATE       Real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of $4 million in each of the past three years, which amounts are included in the corporate and other results for those years. In each year, we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties. Real estate revenues were $75 million in 2000, $97 million in 1999 and $82 million in 1998.       We own approximately $325 million of land which we expect will be developed in the future. In addition, we own approximately $190 million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease. We are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties.       Loans receivable, which amounted to $90 million at December 31, 2000, are primarily purchase money mortgages. Such loans, which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales, are generally collateralized by buildings and, in some cases, land. We continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves.       The recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream. The assumptions used reflect a continued improvement in demand for office space, an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term. Management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets. However, if the assets are not sold or developed as presently contemplated, it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized.                                          23 24  INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES       Net investment gains realized by the Corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries were as follows: 2000   1999   1998                                                               ----   ----   ----                                                                 (IN MILLIONS) Equity securities...........................................  $(1)   $63    $100 Fixed maturities............................................    8     24      42 Sale of AAU.................................................   45     --      --                                                               ---    ---    ---- Realized investment gains before tax........................  $52    $87    $142                                                               ===    ===    ==== Realized investment gains after tax.........................  $34    $56    $ 92                                                               ===    ===    ==== Decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences. Thus, realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year.       Sales of equity securities in 1999 and 1998 resulted in net realized investment gains due primarily to the significant appreciation in the United States equity markets. A primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after-tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so.       Fixed maturity securities that the Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. The remaining fixed maturities, which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies, such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after-tax returns, are classified as available-for-sale. Fixed maturities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are carried at market value. At December 31, 2000, 10% of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held-to-maturity compared with 12% at December 31, 1999 and 15% at December 31, 1998.       The unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments carried at market value, which includes equity securities and fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of applicable deferred income tax.       The unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was $69 million, $59 million and $138 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.       Changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due to fluctuations in interest rates.  MARKET RISK       The main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the Corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after-tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations. Investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position, regulatory requirements, fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks. Investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors.       Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio, which exposes the Corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries to risks related to interest rates and, to a lesser extent, credit quality, prepayment, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk.                                          24 25       Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. We view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management. Our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities, primarily our property and casualty loss reserves, to determine their duration, which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years. We set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors, which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the Corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries.       The table below provides information about our fixed maturity investments, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

As a result, we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk. Taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise U.S. Treasury, government agency, mortgage-backed and corporate securities. Approximately 60% of taxable bonds are issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies or rated AA or better by Moody's or Standard and Poor's. Of the tax-exempt bonds, approximately 95% are rated AA or better with more than 60% rated AAA. Only 1% of our bond portfolio is below investment grade. Taxable bonds have an average maturity of six years while tax- exempt bonds mature on average in eight years.       Prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security. Such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. We monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage-backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk.       Mortgage-backed securities comprised 37% and 33% of our taxable bond portfolio at year-end 2000 and 1999, respectively. About 50% of our mortgage-backed securities holdings at December 31, 2000 related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass-through securities, government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and AAA rated non-agency CMOs backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages. The majority of the CMOs are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker/dealers. An additional 25% of our mortgage-backed securities were call protected AAA rated commercial securities. The remaining mortgage-backed holdings were all in investment grade commercial mortgage-backed securities.       Foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments. The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since their business is primarily transacted in such local currency. We reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities. Such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies. At December 31, 2000, the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign investments of $1.4 billion supporting their international operations. Such foreign investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the British pound sterling. The table on page 27 provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies. The table presents cash flows of principal amounts in U.S. dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at December 31, 2000 and 1999. Actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts.                                          26 27                   FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIXED MATURITIES                     EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2000                                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                     TOTAL                                                                                             ---------------------                                                                                                         ESTIMATED                                                                                    THERE-   AMORTIZED    MARKET                                                 2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   AFTER      COST        VALUE                                                 ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   ------   ---------   ---------                                                                           (IN MILLIONS) Canadian dollar...........................  $23    $21    $29    $26    $31     $232      $362        $377     Euro......................................    9     24     25     28     14      213       313         317     British pound sterling....................   --     13     26     30     34      134       237         240 AT DECEMBER 31, 1999                                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                     TOTAL                                                                                             ---------------------                                                                                                         ESTIMATED                                                                                    THERE-   AMORTIZED    MARKET                                                 2000   2001   2002   2003   2004   AFTER      COST        VALUE                                                 ----   ----   ----   ----   ----   ------   ---------   ---------                                                                           (IN MILLIONS) Canadian dollar...........................  $19    $43    $50    $64    $58     $132      $366        $372     Euro......................................   --     36     32     44     33      159       304         301     British pound sterling....................   10     --     28     40     38      112       228         225 Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of equity securities. In general, equities have more year-to-year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds. However, returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher. Our equity securities are high quality, diversified across industries and readily marketable. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the market prices of the equity securities held at December 31, 2000 and 1999 would have resulted in a decrease of $83 million and $77 million, respectively, in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio.       All of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis. A combination of in-house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio. These tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio.       Interest rate risk also exists on our debt obligations. At December 31, 2000, the expected cash flow of principal amounts of such debt obligations were: a $10 million 7 1/2% term loan in 2001, $100 million of 6 7/8% notes in 2003, $300 million of 6.15% notes in 2005 and $342 million after 2005 with a weighted average interest rate of 7.7%.  CAPITAL RESOURCES       In March 1997, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 17,500,000 shares of common stock. In July 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 12,500,000 shares. Through December 31, 2000, the Corporation had repurchased 24,375,000 shares under the 1997 and 1998 authorizations. As of December 31, 2000, 5,625,000 shares remained under the current share repurchase authorizations. The Corporation repurchased 3,783,400 shares in open-market transactions in 2000 at a cost of $242 million, 2,596,700 shares in 1999 at a cost of $145 million and 8,203,000 shares in 1998 at a cost of $609 million.       The Corporation filed a shelf registration statement which the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective in September 1998, under which up to $600 million of various types of securities may be issued by the Corporation or Chubb Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary. No securities have been issued under this registration statement.       The Corporation has outstanding $300 million of unsecured 6.15% notes due in 2005 and $100 million of unsecured 6.60% debentures due in 2018. Chubb Capital has outstanding $100 million of unsecured 6 7/8% notes due in 2003. The Chubb Capital notes are guaranteed by the Corporation.                                          27 28       The long term debt obligations of Executive Risk remained in place subsequent to the acquisition. Chubb Executive Risk Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, has outstanding $75 million of unsecured 7 1/8% notes due in 2007. Executive Risk Capital Trust, wholly owned by Chubb Executive Risk, has outstanding $125 million of 8.675% capital securities. The sole assets of the Trust are debentures issued by Chubb Executive Risk. The capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption in 2027 upon repayment of the debentures. The capital securities are also subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances beginning in 2007. The Corporation has guaranteed the unsecured notes and the capital securities.       The Corporation has two credit agreements with a group of banks that provide for unsecured borrowings of up to $500 million in the aggregate. The $200 million short term revolving credit facility, which was to have terminated on July 5, 2000, was extended to July 4, 2001, and may be renewed or replaced. The $300 million medium term revolving credit facility terminates on July 11, 2002. On the respective termination dates, any loans then outstanding become payable. There have been no borrowings under these agreements. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes and to support Chubb Capital's commercial paper borrowing arrangement.  ITEM 7A.

In the        event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities        (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or        paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the        registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or        proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling        person in connection with the securities being registered, the        registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter        has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of        appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification        by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be        governed by the final adjudication of such issue.                                          30 31                                     SIGNATURES       PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, THE REGISTRANT HAS DULY CAUSED THIS REPORT TO BE SIGNED ON ITS BEHALF BY THE UNDERSIGNED, THEREUNTO DULY AUTHORIZED.
