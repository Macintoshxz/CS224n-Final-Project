In  consideration  of the  promises set forth in this  Agreement,  the Employee and the Company (the "Parties") hereby agree as follows:  1. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.        This Agreement is the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the  subject  matter  hereof  and,  other than as  specifically  stated  herein, contains all agreements,  whether written, oral, express or implied, between the Parties  relating  thereto and supersedes and  extinguishes  any other agreement relating  thereto,  whether  written,  oral,  express or  implied,  between  the Parties.  Other than this Agreement and as otherwise  explicitly  stated herein, there are no  agreements of any nature  whatsoever  between the Employee and the Company that  survive  this  Agreement.  This  Agreement  may not be modified or amended,  nor may any rights under it be waived,  except in a writing signed and agreed to by the Parties.  2. CONTINUATION AND CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND APPOINTMENTS.        A.  The  Employee  hereby  resigns,  as of the  Effective  Date,  as Chief Executive Officer of the Company,  and as an officer and director of the Company and all of its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively,  the "Company Group"). The Employee will continue as a non-executive employee of the Company (and of no other member of the Company  Group) until April 1, 2004, or such earlier date as his  employment  is  terminated  in  accordance  with Section 2.B. or 2.C.  (the "Termination  Date"), and his employment with the Company shall cease at 11:59pm on the  Termination  Date.  The Employee  shall take all actions and execute all documents  reasonably  requested  by the  Company  in  order  to  implement  the preceding two  sentences.  As of and following the Effective  Date, the Employee shall have no  authority  to act on behalf of the Company or any other member of the Company  Group,  and shall not hold himself out as having such  authority or otherwise  act in an  executive,  director or other  decision  making  capacity, unless and only to the extent specifically  granted such authority in writing by the  Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer or Chief  Operating  Officer after the Effective Date and before the Termination Date.        B. The Company may terminate the Employee's employment after the Effective Date and  before  the  Termination  Date only for  actions  or  failures  to act following  the  Effective  Date  that  constitute  "Cause,"  as  defined  in the Company's 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1999 Plan") or in the Severance and Noncompetition Agreement between the Parties (the "Severance Agreement").        C. The Employee may resign his  employment  after the  Effective  Date and before  the  Termination  Date at any time for any  reason,  by  giving  advance written notice to the Company which identifies the date of such resignation.
2         D. From the Effective Date through the Termination Date the Employee shall use his  reasonable  best efforts  during normal  business hours to perform such tasks   comparable  to  and   commensurate   with  the  Employee's   duties  and responsibilities  as  the  chief  executive  officer  of the  Company  as may be assigned to him by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial  Officer of the Company,  including  but not limited to assisting  the Company in the transition to a new Chief Executive  Officer.  From the Effective Date  through the  Termination  Date the Company will provide to the Employee an office and  secretarial  assistance  appropriate  for a retired chief  executive officer that is remaining available to perform services for the Company.        E. The Parties  agree that the cessation of the  Employee's  employment on the Termination Date shall be treated as a resignation by the Employee, and as a termination  described  in (i)  Section  14.3 of the 1999 Plan in respect of the stock  option  grant made to the  Employee as of May 14, 1999 (the "1999  Option Grant"), which grant the Parties agree is governed by the provisions of the 1999 Plan,  and (ii) Section 6(e) of the Stock Option  Agreement  between the Parties dated as of March 29, 2001 (the "2001 Option Agreement") in respect of the stock option grant made to the Employee as of such date (the "2001 Option  Grant") and (iii) Section 6(e) of the Stock Option Agreement between the Parties dated as of February 5, 2003 (the "2003  Stock  Option  Agreement")  in respect of the stock option  grant made to the  Employee as of such date (the "2003  Option  Grant"); provided that if the Employee is  terminated by the Company  pursuant to Section 2.B., then such termination  shall be considered to be a termination for "Cause" under the 1999 Plan,  the 2001 Option  Agreement and the 2003 Option  Agreement. Each of the 1999 Plan, the 1999 Option Grant, the 2001 Option Grant and the 2003 Option Grant are agreements that survive this Agreement.  3. ENTITLEMENTS: STOCK OPTIONS.        A. As of and after the  Effective  Date,  the Employee  shall  continue to participate only in those employee  benefit plans and arrangements  sponsored by the Company which are available to non-executive employees of the Company. As of and following the Termination  Date, the Employee shall no longer accrue service credit or have contributions made on his behalf under, any employee benefit plan or arrangement  sponsored by the Company in respect of periods commencing on and following the Termination Date including,  without limitation, any plan which is intended to qualify under Section  401(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;  provided  that the Employee may elect  continued  group health care coverage  pursuant to COBRA and in  accordance  with the terms of the  Company's group  health  plans.  The Employee  shall be entitled to all  benefits  accrued through the Termination  Date, to the extent vested,  under all employee benefit plans of the  Company,  in  accordance  with the terms of such plans,  and these plans and the Employee's rights under these plans shall survive this Agreement.        B. During the period  commencing on the  Effective  Date and ending on the Termination  Date, the  Employee's  sole cash  compensation  from the Company in respect  of his  employment  shall be  salary  at a rate of  $100,000  per year, payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices.

D. Any shares of Company common stock obtained by the Employee through the exercise  of stock  options  on or after the  Effective  Date may be sold by the Employee  only in a manner  which does not exceed the volume  limits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, irrespective of whether or not the exemption provided by Rule 144 is legally necessary in order for the Employee to sell Company common stock but for this Section 3.E.        E. The  Company  shall  reimburse  the  Employee  for all  reasonable  and customary  expenses  incurred by the  Executive in  performing  services for the Company prior to the Effective Date and while  performing any services  pursuant to Section 2.D of this  Agreement,  provided that such expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with the policies and procedures  established by the Company;  provided that any expense  incurred after the Effective Date in excess of $2,000,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  shall require the prior written consent of the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.        F.

In addition, the Company and any other member of the Company Group shall maintain  director's  and officer's  liability insurance coverage on behalf of the Employee,  at the level no less than that in effect from time to time for acting  directors  and  officers,  for the six-year period  following  the  Termination  Date,  and  throughout  the  period  of any applicable statute of limitations.        G. The Company  shall pay,  or  reimburse  the  Employee  for,  reasonable attorney's fees and expenses  actually incurred by the Employee in the retention of  Milbank,  Tweed,  Hadley & McCloy  in  connection  with his  termination  of employment with the Company.        H.  Except as set  forth in this  Section  3, the  Company  shall  have no obligation  under this Agreement or otherwise to make any payment or provide any benefit to the Employee following the Termination Date.  4. RETURN OF COMPANY PROPERTY.            No  later than the Termination Date, the  Employee shall return to the Company all originals and copies of papers,  notes and documents (in any medium, including  computer  disks),  whether  property  of the  Company  Group  or not, prepared,  received or obtained by the Employee or his counsel during the course of his employment  with the Company or any member of the Company Group,  and all equipment  and  property  of the Company  Group  which may be in the  Employee's possession  or  under  his  control,  whether  at  the  Company's  offices,  the Employee's  home or elsewhere,  including all such papers,  work papers,  notes, documents  and equipment in the  possession of the Employee or his counsel.

As a condition to the exercise of any portion of the 1999 Option Grant, the  portion of the 2001  Option  Grant  which  vests on March 29,  2004 and the portion of the 2003 Option  Grant which vests on February 5, 2004,  the Employee shall  provide  to the  Company  no later  than the time that the notice of such exercise is provided to the Company or its  representative  a written and signed reaffirmation in the following format:              I hereby  reaffirm,  through and including  the date hereof,  (i) my             release of Cognizant  Technology  Solutions,  Inc.  (the  "Company")             contained in Section 7.A. of the  Separation  Agreement  and General             Release  of All  Claim  between  me and  the  Company,  dated  as of             December 19, 2003 (the  "Agreement"),  and (ii) my  acknowledgements             contained   in   Sections   7.B.   and   7.C.   of  the   Agreement.             Notwithstanding the foregoing, I do not release,  discharge or waive             any rights to  indemnification  that I may have under the By-Laws of             the Company or any other  member of the Company  Group,  the laws of             the State of  Delaware  or any other  applicable  jurisdiction,  any             indemnification  agreement  between me and any member of the Company             Group or any  insurance  coverage  maintained by or on behalf of any             member of the Company Group.  Notwithstanding  the above, if the Employee  provides such  reaffirmation  on or following the Termination Date,  effective through the including the Termination Date,  then he will not be  required  to  provide  any future  affirmation  as a condition to the exercise of any stock options.

Accordingly, the Employee acknowledges, consents and agrees that,  in addition to any other rights or remedies  which the Company may have at law,  in equity or under  this  Agreement,  upon  adequate  proof of his violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to immediate  injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage.  10.
