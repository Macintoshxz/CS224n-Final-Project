Business Overview We are a leading provider of custom IT consulting and technology services as well as outsourcing services for Global 2000 companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. Our core competencies include Technology Strategy Consulting, Complex Systems Development, Enterprise Software Package Implementation and Maintenance, Data Warehousing& Business Intelligence, Application Testing, Application Maintenance, Infrastructure Management, and Vertically-Oriented Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). We tailor our services to specific industries, and utilize an integrated on-site/offshore business model. This seamless on-site/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on-site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in India.
Industry Background Many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics, driven by such factors as changes in government regulations, globalization and technology innovation. In response to these challenges, many companies are focused on improving productivity, increasing service levels, lowering costs and accelerating delivery times. In order to achieve these goals, companies are focusing on a number of technology-centric areas, such as:  Business and IT alignment and optimization;  Advanced custom systems development;  Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence;  Enterprise Resource Planning;  Customer and Supply Chain Management; and  Middleware, Service-Oriented Architectures, Open Source and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).
These approaches and technologies facilitate faster, more responsive, lower-cost business operations. However, their development, integration and on-going maintenance present major challenges and require a large number of highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies. In addition, companies also require additional technical resources to maintain, enhance and re-engineer their core legacy IT systems and to address application maintenance projects. Increasingly, companies are relying on custom IT solutions providers, such as us, to provide these services.
- 1 - Table of Contents In order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment, IT departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on IT investments, lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions. To accomplish these objectives, many IT departments have shifted all or a portion of their IT development, integration and maintenance requirements to outside service providers operating with on-site/offshore business models.
Global demand for high quality, lower cost IT services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for IT service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of, and address the challenges in using, an offshore talent pool. The effective use of offshore personnel can offer a variety of benefits, including lower costs, faster delivery of new IT solutions and innovations in vertical solutions, processes and technologies. Certain developing countries, particularly India, have a large talent pool of highly qualified technical professionals that can provide high quality IT and BPO services at a lower cost. India is a leader in IT services, and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world. Historically, IT service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers. However, evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher value-added services. These services include application design, development, testing, integration and maintenance, as well as technology consulting and infrastructure management.
Indias services and software exports continue to see significant growth. According to NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Services Companies) and McKinsey& Company, the IT/BPO sector in India was a $17.2 billion industry in 2004, and is projected to grow to $50.0billion by 2009.
Using a globally distributed workforce to provide value-added services presents a number of challenges to IT service providers. The offshore implementation of value-added IT services requires that IT service providers continually and effectively attract, train and retain highly skilled software development professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. These skills are necessary to design, develop and deploy high-quality technology solutions in a cost-effective and timely manner. In addition, IT service providers must have the methodologies, processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with on-site personnel. Service providers must also have strong research and development capabilities, technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively.
The Cognizant Approach Our business is organized and managed primarily around our four vertically-oriented business segments:  Financial Services;  Healthcare;  Manufacturing, Retail& Logistics; and  Other  which includes Telecommunications, Information Services, Media and High Technology.
- 2 - Table of Contents This vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and high-customer satisfaction. As the IT Services industry continues to mature, clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses, industry initiatives, culture and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. We have continued to hire experts out of industry, establish a broad base of business analysts, invest in industry training for our staff, and build out industry-specific services and solutions. This approach is central to our high-levels of on-time delivery and customer satisfaction, as we understand the full context of our clients challenges and have deep experience in addressing them.

- 6 - Table of Contents Our Solution and Services We believe that we have developed an effective integrated on-site/offshore business model, and that this business model will be a critical element of our continued growth. To support this business model, at December31, 2005, we employed over 24,000 IT professionals and support staff globally. We have also established facilities, technology and communications infrastructure in order to support our business model.
Across each of our business segments, we provide a broad, and expanding, range of consulting, information technology and business processing outsourcing services, including: IT Consulting and Technology Services  IT Consulting . Consulting offerings that are based on rigorous and proven methodologies and scientifically driven frameworks. In the areas of business processes, technologies and offshoring, we analyze the existing environment, identify opportunities for optimization and provide a robust roadmap for significant cost savings and productivity improvement. The broad areas of coverage include: offshoring strategy, IT strategy, technology rationalization, business process rationalization, change management and IT solution strategy.
Application Design, Development, Integration and Re-engineering . Define customer requirements, write specifications and design, develop, test and integrate software across multiple platforms including Internet technologies. Modify and test applications to enable systems to function in new operating environments. In addition, these services include DataWarehousing / Business Intelligence (BI), ERP and CRM implementation services, as well as testing services. We follow either of two alternative approaches to application development and integration:  full life-cycle application development, in which we assume start-to-finish responsibility for analysis, design, implementation, testing and integration of systems; or  cooperative development, in which our employees work with a customers in-house IT personnel to jointly analyze, design, implement, test and integrate new systems.
In both of these approaches, our on-site team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients. Detailed design, implementation and testing are generally performed offshore at our 27IT development centers located in India and China, as well as our development centers in Chicago, Phoenix, Amsterdam and Toronto. In addition, we maintain an on-site presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project.
A key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations. In this suite of services, we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and Web sites with client server and legacy systems. We build and - 7 - Table of Contents deploy robust, scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries. We maintain competency centers specializing in Microsoft, IBM, SAP and JAVA, among others, in order to be able to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of customers.
Our re-engineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer, open systems-based platforms and client/server architectures, often in response to the more stringent demands of business. Our re-engineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced client/server technologies. We believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform re-engineering services, savings that benefit both us and our customers. These tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to re-design target databases and convert certain programming languages. If necessary, our programmers also help customers re-design and convert user interfaces.
Software Testing Service . Our Software Testing service offering has experienced significant growth in the past year. Through this practice, we provide an independent verification and validation service focused exclusively on supporting the software testing needs of our clients. Our testing service has four key offerings: 1.) Independent Functional Testing, 2.) Test Automation, 3.) Test Process Consulting, and 4.) Performance Testing. We utilize our own Managed Test Center process model to ensure our clients receive the highest quality code possible after it has been tested by us. We focus our Managed Test Centers on specific domains (e.g., specific industries and software solutions), ensuring we tailor our testing solutions to the particular needs of our clients.
Outsourcing  Application Maintenance . Support some or all of a customers applications ensuring that systems remain operational and responsive to changing user requirements, and to provide on-going enhancement as required by the customer. In addition, our maintenance services include infrastructure management.
We provide services to help ensure that a customers core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customers changing needs. As part of this process, we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support.
Our on-site/offshore business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and cost-effective support services to our customers. Our on-site team members often provide help-desk services at the customers facility. These team members typically carry pagers in the event of an emergency service request and are available to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations. In the case of more complex maintenance services, including modifications, enhancements and documentation, which typically have longer turnaround times, we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more cost-effectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local professionals. The services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiber-optic telecommunications.
- 8 - Table of Contents As part of our application maintenance services, we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations, new standards or other external events. These services include, or have previously included, Year 2000 compliance, Eurocurrency compliance, decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for the healthcare industry.
Application maintenance service contracts are usually long term in nature and, at times, can include an element of application development.
We seek to anticipate the operational environment of customers IT systems as we design and develop such systems. We also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their IT systems and optimizing the performance of their systems.
IT Infrastructure Services . We provide IT Infrastructure Management Outsourcing services. This is a newer service at Cognizant, but one where we anticipate growing demand in the coming years. Through our Global Operations Center, we are able to provide significant scale, quality and cost savings to our clients in IT Infrastructure Services. We focus on a number of key areas, including such key areas of infrastructure management as: Networks, Servers, Middleware, Security, Vendors, Storage, Messaging, Databases, and Desktops. We can provide these through an IT Service Desk model, focusing on such areas as IT Operations and IT Help Desk.
Vertical Business Process Outsourcing (V-BPO).
We provide Vertically-Oriented BPO to our clients. This is a newer service at Cognizant, but one in which we anticipate future growth. At Cognizant, we made a strategic decision to stay out of more generic, horizontally-based BPO markets (i.e., call centers) and instead have focused on value-added processes that are specific to clients in our key industry segments (particularly in Financial Services, Healthcare and Manufacturing / Logistics / Retail). Our BPO practice focuses on core back office services covering: Transaction Processing, Voice Processes, Data Administration, Data Management and Data Analytics.
In addition to our industry-specific expertise and focus, our strengths, which we believe differentiate us from other IT service providers, include the following: Established and Scalable Proprietary Processes.
We have developed proprietary methodologies for integrating on-site and offshore teams to facilitate cost-effective, on-time delivery of high-quality projects. These methodologies comprise our proprietary Q*VIEW software engineering process, which is available to all on-site and offshore programmers. We use this ISO 9001:2000 certified process to define and implement projects from the design, development and deployment stages through on-going application maintenance. For most projects, Q*VIEW is used as part of an initial setting up of processes that allows us to define the scope and risks of the project and subdivide the project into smaller phases with frequent deliverables and feedback from customers. We also use our Q*VIEW process to detect, mitigate and correct possible quality defects and to establish appropriate contingencies for each project. In order to ensure implementation of the quality process, we assign a quality facilitator to each project who reports to a centralized quality assurance and software engineering group. This - 9 - Table of Contents group performs, on a sample basis, quality audits, deliverables verifications, metrics collection and analysis, which are used to improve processes and methodologies. These processes and methodologies have proven to be scalable, as we have significantly increased the number of offshore development centers, customers and projects. In addition, all of our principal development centers have been assessed by KPMG at Level 5 (the highest possible rating) of both the Capability Maturity Model and the Capability Maturity Model Integration of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, which are widely recognized means of measuring the quality and maturity of an organizations software development and maintenance processes. In addition, all of our principal development centers have been certified by the STQC Directorate Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Government of India (the accreditation authority for companies in India) under the internationally recognized BS7799 Part2:2002 Information Security Standards, a comprehensive set of controls comprising best practices in information security and business continuity planning. Our quality management system has also been certified by KPMG to International Standard ISO 9001:2000 of the International Organization for Standardization, an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems directed to the achievement of business results, including satisfaction of customers and others.
Highly Skilled Workforce.
Our managers and senior technical personnel provide in-depth project management expertise to customers. To maintain this level of expertise, we have placed significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly skilled professionals. We have over 2,000 project managers and senior technical personnel around the world, many of whom have significant work experience in North America, Europe and Asia. We also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies. We provide five months of combined classroom and on-the-job training to newly hired programmers, as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices, tools, technology and consulting skills of our professional staff. We were recently assessed by KPMG at Level 5 (the highest possible rating) of the People Capability Maturity Model (P-CMM) of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, a widely recognized means of implementing best current practices in fields such as human resources, knowledge management, and organizational development which improves our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues.
Research and Development and Competency Centers . We have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies, and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments. Most of our programmers are trained in multiple technologies and architectures. As a result, we are able to react to customers needs quickly and efficiently redeploy programmers to different technologies. In order to develop and maintain this flexibility, we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers where the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization. In addition, through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel, we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies. We believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster long-term relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers.
- 10 - Table of Contents Well-Developed Infrastructure.
Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our on-site and offshore workforces. This is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on customer projects. This infrastructure allows for:  rapid completion of projects;  highest level of quality;  off-peak use of customers technological resources; and  real-time access to project information by the on-site account manager or the customer.
International time differences enable our offshore teams located in India to access a customers computing facilities located in North America, Europe and Asia / Pacific during off-peak hours. This ability to perform services during off-peak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest in duplicative hardware and software. In addition, for large projects with short time frames, our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time. In addition, we can deliver services more rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to cost-effectively assign more professionals to a project.
Business Strategies Our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of custom IT services. We implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives: Further Develop Long-Term Customer Relationships.
We have strong long-term strategic relationships with our customers and business partners. We seek to establish long-term relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities, frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers chief information officers, or other IT decision makers, by offering a wide array of cost-effective high quality services. Approximately 91% of our revenues in the year ended December31, 2005, were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004. We also seek to leverage our experience with a customers IT systems into new business opportunities. Knowledge of a customers processes and IT systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services, for example, may provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional development and maintenance projects from that customer.
Expand Service Offerings and Solutions.
We have several teams dedicated to developing new, high value services. These teams collaborate with customers to develop these services. For example, we are currently developing new offerings in Business Consulting and IT Consulting, Vertically-Oriented Business Process Outsourcing, and vertically-oriented IT solutions atop innovative technologies including: RFID, Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Open Source. In addition, we invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization in order to promote the development of new - 11 - Table of Contents services and solutions that we can offer to our customers. Furthermore, we continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of:  Customer Relationship Management (CRM);  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP);  Data Warehousing / Business Intelligence (BI);  Software Testing; and  Infrastructure Management.
We believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and will help foster long-term relationships with our customers by allowing us to serve their needs better.
Enhance Processes, Methodologies and Productivity Toolsets.
We are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary Q*VIEW software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets. In light of the rapid evolution of technology, we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success. We are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques. In addition, we use groupware technology to share project experience and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity.
Expand Domestic and International Geographic Presence .
As we expand our customer base, we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in North America, Europe and Asia. It is expected that this expansion will facilitate sales and service to existing and new customers. We have established sales and marketing offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Teaneck. In addition, we have been pursuing market opportunities internationally through our offices in Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Geneva, Amsterdam, Shanghai, Tokyo, Melbourne and Singapore.
Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances.
We believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented IT services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. We believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence and our capabilities more rapidly, especially in geographic markets and key industries. For example, in 2005 we acquired substantially all the assets of Fathom Solutions LLC (Fathom), a leading Telecommunications consultancy based in Chicago to provide us, and our customers, with further consulting depth in the Telecommunications sector. In addition, through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process. Finally, we will strategically partner with select IT service firms that offer complementary services in order to best meet the requirements of our customers. In 2005, we announced a strategic partnership with EDS, and in the future we will look to build our ecosystem of strategic partners.
- 12 - Table of Contents Sales and Marketing We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our Teaneck, New Jersey headquarters and our business development offices located across the country and the world in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Teaneck, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zurich, Geneva, Paris, Shanghai, Toronto, Tokyo, Melbourne and Singapore .
At December31, 2005, we had approximately 50direct sales persons and over 220 account managers. The sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales process moves closer to the customers selection of an IT service provider. The duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service, ranging from approximately two months to over one year. The account manager or sales executive works with the technical team to:  define the scope, deliverables, assumptions and execution strategies for a proposed project;  develop project estimates;  prepare pricing and margin analyses; and  finalize sales proposals.
Management reviews and approves proposals, which are then presented to the prospective customer. Our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project through the execution phase. We focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs. We maintain a prospect/customer database that is continuously updated and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close. As a result of this marketing system, we pre-qualify sales opportunities, and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect qualification. In addition, substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention and expansion of services provided to existing customers. In this regard, our account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided to that customer.
Customers The number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years. As of December31, 2005, we were providing services to approximately 250 customers, as compared to 233 customers as of December31, 2004 and 153 customers as of December31, 2003.
For the year ended December31, 2005, we derived our revenues from the following business segments: 49.8% from Financial Services, 19.9% from Healthcare, 17.2% from Retail/Manufacturing/Logistics and 13.1% from Other.
We provide services either on a time-and-material basis or on the basis of an agreed fixed bid. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. While no individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended December31, 2005, approximately 13.7% and 10.1% of our revenues in the fiscal years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were generated from JPMorgan Chase.

This market includes participants from a variety of market segments, including:  systems integration firms;  contract programming companies;  application software companies;  Internet solutions providers;  the professional services groups of computer equipment companies; and  facilities management and outsourcing companies.
Our most direct competitors include, among others, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and WIPRO, which utilize an integrated on-site/offshore business model comparable to that used by us. We also compete with large IT service providers with greater resources, such as Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, Electronic Data Systems and IBM Global Services. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
- 14 - Table of Contents Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include:  performance and reliability;  quality of technical support, training and services;  responsiveness to customer needs;  reputation, experience and financial stability; and  competitive pricing of services.
We rely on the following to compete effectively:  a well developed recruiting, training and retention model;  a successful service delivery model;  a broad referral base;  continual investment in process improvement and knowledge capture;  investment in research and development;  continued focus on responsiveness to customer needs, quality of services, competitive prices; and  project management capabilities and technical expertise.
Intellectual Property Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We presently hold no patents or registered copyrights. Instead, we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, independent contractors, vendors and customers to enter into written confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. In addition, when we disclose any confidential or proprietary information to third parties, we routinely require those third parties to agree in writing to keep that information confidential.
A portion of our business involves the development for customers of highly complex information technology software applications and other technology deliverables. This intellectual property includes written specifications and documentation in connection with specific customer engagements. Our customers usually own the intellectual property in the software we develop for them.
- 15 - Table of Contents On July1, 1998 Nielsen Media Research, Inc., the successor in interest to Cognizant Corporation, assigned all its rights, title and interest in and to the name Cognizant and to our corporate logo to us. On February6, 2003, we assigned certain of our assets, including all of our intangible assets, to our wholly-owned United States subsidiary, Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S. Corporation. As of December31, 2005, our United States operating company is the owner of three trademark registrations in the United States and four pending trademark applications in India. In addition, as of December31, 2005, our United States operating company held 232 other trademark registrations in 57 other countries, a pending application for our corporate logo in the European Union and two pending applications for our company name and corporate logo in Malaysia.
Employees As of December31, 2005, we employed approximately 24,300 persons, including over 4,700persons on a full-time basis in various locations throughout North America. We also employed over 500 persons on a full-time basis in various locations throughout Europe, principally in the United Kingdom, and over 18,900 persons on a full-time basis in our offshore IT development centers in India. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining arrangement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled IT development professionals. In particular, we need to attract, train and retain project managers, programmers and other senior technical personnel. We believe there is a shortage of, and significant competition for, IT development professionals in the United States and in India with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer. We have an active recruitment program in India, and have developed a recruiting system and database that facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates. During the course of the year, we conduct extensive recruiting efforts at premier colleges and technical schools in India. We evaluate candidates based on academic performance, the results of a written aptitude test measuring problem-solving skills and a technical interview. In addition, we have an active lateral recruiting program in North America, Europe and India. A substantial majority of the personnel on most on-site teams and virtually all the personnel staffed on offshore teams is comprised of Indian nationals.
Our senior project managers are hired from leading consulting firms in the United States and India. Our senior management and most of our project managers have experience working in the United States and Europe. This enhances our ability to attract and retain other professionals with experience in the United States. We have also adopted a career and education management program to define our employees objectives and career plans. We have implemented an intensive orientation and training program to introduce new employees to the Q*VIEW software engineering process, our other technologies and our services.

Corporate History We began our IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house technology development center for The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, we, along with certain other entities, were spun-off from The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June24, 1998, we completed an initial public offering of our ClassA common stock. On June30, 1998, a majority interest in us, and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health. Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of our outstanding stock (representing all of our Class B common stock) and held 92.5% of the combined voting power of our common stock.
On January30, 2003, we filed a tender offer in which IMS Health stockholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for our Class B common stock held by IMS Health.
On February13, 2003, IMS Health distributed all of our Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders. There was no impact on the number of our total shares outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer.
As of February21, 2003, pursuant to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common stock automatically converted into shares of ClassA common stock. According to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, if at any time the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock ceased to represent at least 35% of the economic ownership represented by the aggregate number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, each share of our Class B common stock shall automatically convert into one share of ClassA common stock. This automatic conversion occurred on February21, 2003 based on share numbers - 18 - Table of Contents received by us from our transfer agent (American Stock Transfer and Trust Company) as of the close of business February20, 2003, which indicated that the Class B common stock represented less than 35% ownership represented by the aggregate number of shares of our common stock then outstanding. Accordingly, as of February21, 2003, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.
On April12, 2004, the Board of Directors declared a conditional two-for-one stock split to be effected by a 100% stock dividend payable on June17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May27, 2004. The stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on May26, 2004 and, as a result, the stock dividend was paid on June17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May27, 2004.
This stock split, as well as our other stock splits, have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of common shares and per share information were restated. Appropriate adjustments have been made in the exercise price and number of shares subject to stock options. Stockholder equity accounts were restated to reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued common shares from the additional paid-in-capital account to the common stock accounts.

- 19 - Table of Contents Item1A. Risk Factors Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline .
A substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in India and we are subject to regulatory, economic and political uncertainties in India.
We intend to continue to develop and expand our offshore facilities in India where, as of December31, 2005, a majority of our technical professionals were located. While wage costs are lower in India than in the United States and other developed countries for comparably skilled professionals, wages in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the United States, which could result in our incurring increased costs for technical professionals and reduced operating margins. In addition, there is intense competition in India for skilled technical professionals and we expect that competition to increase.
India has also experienced civil unrest and terrorism and has been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries. In recent years, there have been military confrontations between India and Pakistan that have occurred in the region of Kashmir and along the Indian-Pakistan border. The potential for hostilities between the two countries has been high in light of tensions related to recent terrorist incidents in India and the unsettled nature of the regional geopolitical environment, including events in and related to Afghanistan and Iraq. If India were to become engaged in armed hostilities, particularly if these hostilities were protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction, our operations would be materially adversely affected. In addition, United States companies may decline to contract with us for services in light of international terrorist incidents or armed hostilities even where India is not involved because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources.
In the past, the Indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries, including high inflation, erratic gross domestic product growth and shortages of foreign exchange. The Indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the Indian economy, and Indian government actions concerning the economy could have a material adverse effect on private sector entities, including us. In the past, the Indian government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy, including the software development services industry. Programs that have benefited us include, among others, tax holidays, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. Notwithstanding these benefits, Indias central and state governments remain significantly involved in the Indian economy as regulators. The elimination of any of the benefits realized by us from our Indian operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- 20 - Table of Contents We are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities and physical infrastructure, and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately.
As of December31, 2005, we had contractual commitments of approximately $21.5 million related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our development centers. We may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities. These expansions may increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately, our profitability will be reduced.
Our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties.
Revenues from customers outside North America represented approximately 13% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December31, 2005, 13% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December31, 2004 and 12% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December31, 2003. We anticipate that revenues from customers outside North America will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence, particularly in Europe. In addition, a majority of our employees and almost all of our IT development centers are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. From time to time, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. In addition, we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations generally. We may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations, as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture. Our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We face intense competition from other IT service providers.
The intensely competitive IT professional services market includes a large number of participants and is subject to rapid change. This market includes participants from a variety of market segments, including:  systems integration firms;  contract programming companies;  application software companies; - 21 - Table of Contents  Internet solutions providers;  the professional services groups of computer equipment companies; and  facilities management and outsourcing companies.
The market also includes numerous smaller local competitors in the various geographic markets in which we operate. Our direct competitors who use the on-site/offshore business model include, among others, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and WIPRO. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. Some of these larger competitors, such as Accenture, Electronic Data Systems and IBM Global Services, have offshore operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth as competitive pressures, including competition for skilled IT development professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an on-site/offshore business model, increase.
Our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment.
The IT services market is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences and new product and service introductions. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the IT services market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new services addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. In addition, there can be no assurance that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our ability to remain competitive will also depend on our ability to design and implement, in a timely and cost-effective manner, solutions for customers moving from the mainframe environment to client/server or other advanced architectures. Our failure to design and implement solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may face difficulties in providing end-to-end business solutions for our clients that could cause clients to discontinue their work with us, which in turn could harm our business.
We have been expanding the nature and scope of our engagements and have added new service offerings, such as IT consulting, business process outsourcing, systems integration and outsourcing of entire portions of IT infrastructure. The success of these service offerings is dependent, in part, upon continued demand for such services by our existing and new clients and our ability to meet this demand in a cost-competitive and effective manner. In addition, our ability to effectively offer a wider breadth of end-to-end business solutions depends on our ability to attract existing or new clients to these service offerings. To obtain engagements for such end-to-end solutions, we also are more likely to compete with large, well-established - 22 - Table of Contents international consulting firms, resulting in increased competition and marketing costs. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that our new service offerings will effectively meet client needs or that we will be able to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings.
The increased breadth of our service offerings may result in larger and more complex projects with our clients. This will require us to establish closer relationships with our clients and a thorough understanding of their operations. Our ability to establish such relationships will depend on a number of factors, including the proficiency of our IT professionals and our management personnel. Our failure to understand our client requirements or our failure to deliver services which meet the requirements specified by our clients could result in termination of client contracts, and we could be liable to our clients for significant penalties or damages.
Larger projects may involve multiple engagements or stages, and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements. These terminations, cancellations or delays may result from the business or financial condition of our clients or the economy generally, as opposed to factors related to the quality of our services. Such cancellations or delays make it difficult to plan for project resource requirements, and inaccuracies in such resource planning may have a negative impact on our profitability.
Competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals.
Our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled IT development professionals. In particular, we need to attract, train and retain project managers, IT engineers and other senior technical personnel. We believe there is a shortage of, and significant competition for, IT development professionals in the United States and India with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer. We have subcontracted, to a limited extent in the past, and may do so in the future, with other service providers in order to meet our obligations to our customers. Our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend, in large part, on our ability to attract, train and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. Further, we must train and manage our growing work force, requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel. There can be no assurance that the management skills and systems currently in place will be adequate or that we will be able to train and assimilate new employees successfully. Our failure to attract, train and retain current or future employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions.
Our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with technical and project management skills from developing countries, especially India. The vast majority of our IT professionals in the United States and in Europe are Indian nationals. The ability of Indian nationals to work in the United States depends on their ability and our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits.
- 23 - Table of Contents The H-1 B visa classification enables United States employers to hire qualified foreign workers in positions which require an education at least equal to a Baccalaureate Degree in the United States in specialty occupations such as IT systems engineering and systems analysis. The H-1 B visa usually permits an individual to work and live in the United States for a period of up to six years. There is a limit on the number of new H-1 B petitions that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS, one of the successor agencies to the Immigration and Naturalization Service) may approve in any federal fiscal year, and in years in which this limit is reached, we may be unable to obtain H-1 B visas necessary to bring foreign employees to the United States. In the current federal fiscal year, the limit is 65,000. This cap has been reached as of October1, 2005. New H-1 B petitions may not be filed until April1, 2006, and these petitions must be for positions beginning no earlier than October1, 2006. However, as a part of our advanced planning process, we believe that we have sufficient employees visa-ready to meet our anticipated business growth in the current year. In addition, there are strict labor regulations associated with the H-1 B visa classification. Higher users of the H-1 B visa program are often subject to investigations by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor. A finding by the United States Department of Labor of willful or substantial failure by us to comply with existing regulations on the H-1 B classification may result in a bar on future use of the H-1 B program.
We also regularly transfer employees of our subsidiary in India to the United States to work on projects and at client sites, using the L-1 visa classification. The L-1 visa allows companies abroad to transfer certain managers, executives and employees with specialized company knowledge to related United States companies such as a parent, subsidiary, affiliate, joint venture or branch office. We have an approved Blanket L Program, under which the corporate relationships of our transferring and receiving entities have been pre-approved by the CIS, thus enabling individual L-1 applications to be presented directly to a United States consular post abroad rather than undergoing the pre-approval process in the United States. In recent years, both the United States consular posts that review initial L-1 applications and the CIS offices, which adjudicate extensions of L-1 status, have become more restrictive with respect to this category. As a result, the rate of refusals of initial L-1 applications and of extension denials has increased. In addition, even where L-1 visas are ultimately granted and issued, security measures undertaken by United States consular posts around the world have caused major delays in visa issuances. Our inability to bring qualified technical personnel into the United States to staff on-site customer locations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
On December8, 2004, President Bush signed the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This legislation contained several important changes to the laws governing L-1 visa holders. All of the changes took effect on June8, 2005. Under one provision of the new law, all L-1 applicants, including those brought to the United States under a Blanket Program, must have worked abroad with the related company for one full year in the prior three years. The provision allowing Blanket L applicants who had worked abroad for the related company for six months during the qualifying three-year period has been revoked. In addition, L-1B holders (intracompany transferees with specialized company knowledge) may not be primarily stationed at the work site of another employer if the L-1B holder will be controlled and supervised by an employer other than the petitioning employer. Finally, L-1B status may not be granted where placement of the L-1B visa holder at a third party site is part of an arrangement to provide labor for the third party, rather than placement at the site in connection with the provision of a product or service involving specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer.
- 24 - Table of Contents We do not place L-1B workers at third party sites where they are under the supervision of a different employer, nor do we place L-1B holders at third party sites in an arrangement to provide labor for the third party, without providing a service involving our specialized knowledge. Since implementation of the new law, we have not encountered any difficulty in establishing this fact to the satisfaction of Citizenship and Immigration Services. However, the United States Department of State is still in the process of implementing this provision at United States consular posts abroad. If these posts decide to interpret these provisions in a very restrictive fashion, this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the United States with resources from our entities abroad. In addition, Citizenship and Immigration Services has not yet issued regulations governing these new provisions. If such regulations are restrictive in nature, this could impair our ability to staff our projects in the United States with resources from our entities abroad.
We also process immigrant visas for lawful permanent residence for employees to fill positions for which there are no able, willing and qualified United States workers available to fill the positions. Compliance with existing United States immigration and labor laws, or changes in those laws making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to successfully obtain permanent residence for our foreign employees in the United States, could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the United States. Any of these restrictions or limitations on our hiring practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition to immigration restrictions in the United States, there are certain restrictions on transferring our employees to work in the United Kingdom, where we have experienced significant growth. The United Kingdom requires that employees who are not nationals of the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes nationals of all European Union countries plus Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to obtain an intra-company transfer work permit before beginning to perform work. Under the work permit regulations, in order for us to transfer our non-EEA employees to the United Kingdom, we must demonstrate that the employee had been employed by us for at least six months prior to the transfer and that the position in the United Kingdom requires someone with either: (1)a United Kingdom degree level qualification; or (2)a Higher National Diploma (HND) level occupational qualification which entitles a person to do a specific job; or (3)a general HND level qualification plus one years work experience doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought; or (4)at least three years high-level specialist skills acquired through doing the type of job for which the work permit is sought. These restrictions restrain our ability to add the skilled professionals we need for our operations in Europe, and could have an adverse affect on our international strategy to expand our presence in Europe. As a result, the changes to work permit legislation in the United Kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Immigration and work permit laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as - 25 - Table of Contents changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration and work permit laws and regulation can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations impair our ability to staff projects with IT professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed.
Anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers.
The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by American companies is a topic of political discussion in the United States. Measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by United States companies are under discussion in Congress and in numerous state legislatures. While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been introduced to date, given the ongoing debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If introduced, such measures are likely to fall within two categories: (1)a broadening of restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly, and/or (2)measures that impact private industry, such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions. In the event that any of these measures become law, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired.
An economic slowdown, hostilities involving the United States, and other acts of terrorism, violence or war could delay or reduce the number of new purchase orders we receive and impair our ability to service our customers, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Approximately 87% of our revenue during the year ended December31, 2005 was derived from customers located in the United States. In the event of an economic slowdown, our customers may delay or reduce their IT spending significantly, which may in turn lower the demand for our services and could have a material adverse affect on our financial results. Further, hostilities involving the United States and other acts of terrorism, violence or war, such as the attacks of September11, 2001 in the United States, the attacks of July7, 2005 in the United Kingdom, and the continuing conflict in Iraq, could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service our customers. Hostilities involving the United States could cause customers in the United States to delay their decisions on IT spending, which could affect our financial results. In addition, acts of terrorism, violence or war could give rise to military or travel disruptions and restrictions affecting our employees. As of December31, 2005, a majority of our technical professionals were located in India, and the vast majority of our technical professionals in the United States and Europe are Indian nationals who are able to work in the United States and Europe only because they hold current visas and work permits. Travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled professionals we need for our operations in the United States and Europe.
- 26 - Table of Contents Although we continue to believe that we have a strong competitive position in the United States, we continue to increase our efforts to geographically diversify our clients and revenue. Despite our efforts to diversify, an economic slowdown, hostilities involving the United States, and other acts of terrorism, violence or war may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability.
Our ability to operate and compete effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel.
Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of the key members of our management team, as well as marketing, sales and technical personnel, and our ability to attract and retain new management and other personnel. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or significant employees. Competition for personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel in the future. The loss of any one or more of our key personnel or the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Restrictions in non-competition agreements with our executive officers may not be enforceable.
We have entered into non-competition agreements with all of our executive officers. We cannot assure you, however, that the restrictions in these agreements prohibiting the executive officers from engaging in competitive activities are enforceable. Further, substantially all of our professional non-executive staff are not covered by agreements that would prohibit them from working for our competitors. If any of our key professional personnel leaves our employment and joins one of our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.
Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in India.
Effective January1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.23, Accounting for Income Taxes-Special Areas, we no longer accrue incremental United States taxes on all Indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. While we have no plans to do so, events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent on repatriating Indian earnings. If we change our intent and repatriate such earnings, we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2005. These increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
A significant portion of our projects are on a fixed-price basis, subjecting us to the risks associated with cost over-runs and operating cost inflation.
We contract to provide services either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price basis, with fixed-price contracts accounting for approximately 25% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December31, 2005 and approximately 24% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended - 27 - Table of Contents December31, 2004. We expect that an increasing number of our future projects will be contracted on a fixed-price basis. We bear the risk of cost over-runs and operating cost inflation in connection with projects covered by fixed-price contracts. Our failure to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a fixed-price project, or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame committed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If we do not continue to improve our operational, financial and other internal controls and systems to manage our rapid growth, our business may suffer and the value of our shareholders investment may be harmed.
Our anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources. Our growth will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational, financial and other internal controls, both in the United States, India and elsewhere. In particular, our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in:  recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled technical, marketing and management personnel;  adhering to our high quality standards;  maintaining high levels of client satisfaction;  developing and improving our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, communications and other internal systems; and  preserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment.
As part of our growth strategy, we are expanding our operations in Europe and Asia. We may not be able to compete effectively in these markets and the cost of entering these markets may be substantially greater than we expect. If we fail to compete effectively in the new markets we enter, or if the cost of entering those markets is substantially greater than we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we cannot compete effectively, we may be required to reconsider our strategy to invest in our international expansion plans and change our intent on the repatriation of our earnings.
We rely on a few customers for a large portion of our revenues.
Our top five customers generated approximately 34% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended December31, 2005, approximately 38% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended December31, 2004 and approximately 36% of our revenues in the fiscal year ended December31, 2003. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a major customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. The loss of one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- 28 - Table of Contents We generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.
Consistent with industry practice, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, we are substantially exposed to volatility in the market for our services, and may not be able to maintain our level of profitability. If we are unable to market our services on terms we find acceptable, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.
Our operating results experience significant quarterly fluctuations.
We historically have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations and expect these fluctuations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations have been:  the number, timing, scope and contractual terms of IT development and maintenance projects in which we are engaged;  delays incurred in the performance of those projects;  the accuracy of estimates of resources and time required to complete ongoing projects; and  general economic conditions.
In addition, our future revenues, operating results and margins may fluctuate as a result of:  changes in pricing in response to customer demand and competitive pressures;  the mix of on-site and offshore staffing;  the ratio of fixed-price contracts versus time-and-materials contracts;  employee wage levels and utilization rates;  changes in foreign exchange rates;  the timing of collection of accounts receivable; and  changes in domestic and international income tax rates and regulations.
A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects or in employee wage levels and utilization rates may cause significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and could result in losses. Any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations, any material reduction in utilization rates for our professional staff or variance in the on-site, offshore staffing mix, an unanticipated termination of a major project, a customers decision not to pursue a new project or proceed to succeeding stages of a current project or the completion during a quarter of several major customer projects could require us to pay underutilized employees and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- 29 - Table of Contents As a result of these factors, it is possible that in some future periods, our revenues and operating results may be significantly below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such an event, the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected.
We may not be able to sustain our current level of profitability.
As of December31, 2005, we had a gross margin of 45.8% and operating margin of 20.1%, compared to a gross margin of 45.5% and operating margins of 20.0% as of December31, 2004. These margins may decline if we experience declines in demand and pricing for our services. In addition, wages in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the United States, which could result in us incurring increased costs for technical professionals. Although we have been able to partially offset wage increases and foreign currency fluctuations through further leveraging of our low-cost operating structure and obtaining price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future.
Liability claims for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers businesses and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. Although we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering our IT development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that any contractual limitations on liability will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages.
In addition, we often have access to or are required to collect and store confidential client and customer data. If any person, including any of our employees, penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data, we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data, whether through breach of our computer systems, systems failure or otherwise, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.
Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- 30 - Table of Contents We may have potential liability arising from the IMS Health exchange offer in the event that we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement entered into with IMS Health.
We entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January7, 2003, with IMS Health (the Distribution Agreement), that provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will& Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we agreed to indemnify IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach of the representations that we made and were relied upon by McDermott, Will& Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We may be subject to legacy Dun& Bradstreet liabilities that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
In 1996, The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation, now known as R.H. Donnelly Corporation, split itself into three separate companies: The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation, Cognizant Corporation and ACNielsen Corporation. In connection with the split-up transaction, The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation, Cognizant Corporation (renamed Nielsen Media Research), of which we were once a part, and ACNielsen Corporation (now a subsidiary of the Dutch company VNU N.A.) entered into a distribution agreement. In the 1996 distribution agreement, each party assumed the liabilities relating to the businesses allocated to it and agreed to indemnify the other parties and their subsidiaries against those liabilities and certain other matters. The 1996 distribution agreement also prohibited each party thereto from distributing to our stockholders any business allocated to it unless the distributed business delivered undertakings agreeing to be jointly and severally liable to the other parties under the 1996 distribution agreement for the liabilities of the distributing parent company under the 1996 distribution agreement. IMS Health made such undertaking when it was spun off by Nielsen Media Research in 1998 and, accordingly, IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research are jointly and severally liable to R.H. Donnelly and ACNielsen for Cognizant Corporation obligations under the terms of the 1996 distribution agreement. IMS Health has requested similar undertakings from us as a condition to the distribution of our shares in the exchange offer. IMS Health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from us to Nielsen Media Research and Synavant Inc. with respect to liabilities allocated to IMS Health in connection with Nielsen Media Researchs spin-off of IMS Health and IMS Healths spin-off of Synavant Inc. In connection with the exchange offer, we gave these undertakings and, as a result, we may be subject to claims in the future in relation to legacy liabilities.
One possible legacy liability arises from a pending antitrust action filed by Information Resources Inc. in 1996, which names as joint defendants all parties to the 1996 distribution agreement. Information Resources complaint alleges damages in excess of $350.0million, - 31 - Table of Contents which amount it has asked to be trebled, plus punitive damages. ACNielsen Corporation agreed in connection with the 1996 distribution agreement to assume any and all liabilities resulting from the Information Resources claim to the extent that ACNielsen remains financially viable. In connection with VNUs acquisition of ACNielsen in 2001, VNU was required to assume this liability and to be included with ACNielsen for purposes of determining the amount that can be paid by ACNielsen in respect of any claim. IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research, Inc., successors to Cognizant Corporation, have agreed to share liabilities in excess of the amount ACNielsen is required to pay under the 1996 distribution agreement in respect of this claim on a 50-50 basis with The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation (subsequently separated into The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation and Moodys Corporation). IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research, Inc. further agreed to share their portion of the liabilities in relation to the Information Resources action on a 75-25 basis, subject to Nielsen Media Research, Inc.s liability in respect of the Information Resources action and certain other contingent liabilities being capped at $125.0million. Based on our undertaking, we could be held liable for those amounts that VNU, IMS Health, Nielsen Media Research, Inc., and The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation and their successors are unable or unwilling to pay.
Other claims have arisen in the past and may arise in the future under the 1996 distribution agreement or the distribution agreements relating to Nielsen Media Researchs spin-off of IMS Health and IMS Healths spin-off of Synavant Inc., in which case we may be jointly and severally liable for any losses suffered by the parties entitled to indemnification.
IMS Health has agreed to indemnify us for any and all liabilities that arise out of our undertakings to be jointly and severally liable for these liabilities, but if for any reason IMS Health does not perform on our indemnification obligation, these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business may be adversely affected.
Our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We presently hold no patents or registered copyrights, and rely upon a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements and various security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. India is a member of the Berne Convention, and has agreed to recognize protections on copyrights conferred under the laws of foreign countries, including the laws of the United States. We believe that laws, rules, regulations and treaties in effect in the United States and India are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our copyrights. However, there can be no assurance that these laws will not change and, in particular, that the laws of India or the United States will not change in ways that may prevent or restrict the transfer of software components, libraries and toolsets from India to the United States or from the United States to India. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of any of our intellectual property, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of technology, products or services which compete with our products and unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products, services or proprietary information.
- 32 - Table of Contents Although we believe that our intellectual property rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any of our competitors or others, there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future, that assertion of infringement claims will not result in litigation or that we would prevail in that litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if our competitors are able to obtain patents for software products and processes. Any infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, could result in substantial cost to us and divert managements attention from our operations. Any infringement claim or litigation against us could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be unable to integrate acquired companies or technologies successfully and we may be subject to certain liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions that could harm our operating results.
We believe that opportunities exist in the fragmented IT services market to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. We believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence, especially in the European market, enter new technology areas or expand our capacity. We cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisition or joint venture or successfully integrate any acquired business or joint venture into our operations. Further, acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of special risks, including diversion of managements attention, failure to retain key personnel, unanticipated events or circumstances and legal liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may finance any future acquisitions with cash, debt financing, the issuance of equity securities or a combination of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms. In addition, acquisitions financed with the issuance of our equity securities could be dilutive.
Although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions, there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess in our due diligence efforts. In particular, to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. While we generally require the selling party to indemnify us for any and all liabilities associated with such liabilities, if for any reason the seller does not perform their indemnification obligation, we may be held responsible for such liabilities. The discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions for which we are unable to perceive for indemnification could harm our operating results.
- 33 - Table of Contents System failure or disruptions in telecommunications could disrupt our business and result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability.
To deliver our services to our customers, we must maintain a high speed network of satellite, fiber optic and land lines and an active voice and data communications 24 hours a day between our main offices in Chennai, our other IT development centers in India and globally and the offices of our customers worldwide. Although we maintain redundancy facilities and satellite communications links, any systems failure or a significant lapse in our ability to transmit voice and data through satellite and telephone communications could result in lost customers and curtailed operations which would reduce our revenue and profitability.
Provisions in our charter, by-laws and stockholders rights plan and provisions under Delaware law may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals.
Provisions in our charter and by-laws, each as amended, our stockholders rights plan and Delaware General Corporate Law (DGCL) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeover proposals or delaying or preventing changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these documents and provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences, and issue shares of preferred stock. Our charter provides for a classified board of directors, which will prevent a change of control of our board of directors at a single meeting of stockholders. The prohibition of our stockholders ability to act by written consent and to call a special meeting will delay stockholder actions until annual meetings or until a special meeting is called by our chairman or chief executive officer or our board of directors. The supermajority-voting requirement for specified amendments to our charter and by-laws allows a minority of our stockholders to block those amendments. The DGCL also contains provisions preventing stockholders from engaging in business combinations with us, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions could also discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as create a depressive effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock.
Compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies and increases our costs of compliance.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations, and Nasdaq National Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies like ours. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards.
In particular, our efforts to comply with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over - 34 - Table of Contents financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. We consistently assess the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified, and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented. While we do not anticipate any material weaknesses, the inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.
We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In addition, the new laws, regulations and standards regarding corporate governance may make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Further, our board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with their performance of duties. As a result, we may face difficulties attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed.

- 41 - Table of Contents Item7. Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Executive Summary In 2005, our revenues increased to $885.8million compared to $586.7million in 2004. Net income increased to $166.3 million or $1.13 per diluted share in 2005 compared to $100.2million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the repatriation of $60.0million of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) of 2004, leading to a one-time tax benefit, included in our 2005 results, of approximately $12.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding this one-time tax benefit, net income increased to $153.9 million or $1.05 per diluted share in 2005. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2005 were as follows:  strong performance of our Financial Services and Healthcare segments. Our Financial Services segment had revenue growth of approximately 52% in 2005 and our Healthcare segment had revenue growth of approximately 51% in 2005;  expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross-sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large-scale outsourcing solutions; and  increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 91% of our 2005 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004.
During 2005, we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives, complex systems development engagements, testing, customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), data warehousing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 250 active clients compared to 233 in 2004 and added 19 strategic clients in 2005 bring the total number of our strategic clients to 67. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between $5.0million and $40.0million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 34% and 46%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2005 as compared approximately 38% and 52%, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2004. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline in future periods.
In Europe, we continue to see growth in the UK market and we are starting to see signs of increased demand in continental Europe. Our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 41% in 2005 to $103.7 million compared to $73.7million in 2004. In 2005, revenue from continental Europe increased by approximately $10.4 million or approximately 83% from approximately $12.5 million in 2004 to approximately $22.9 million in 2005. Continental Europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2006 as we see this area as a growth opportunity for the long-term. The balance of our revenue from Europe came from customers in the UK.
- 42 - Table of Contents In 2005, our operating margin increased to approximately 20.1% compared to 20.0% in 2004. This was consistent with our historic targeted operating margin range of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested the profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i)hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise, (ii)training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings, (iii)strengthening our business analytic capabilities, (iv)strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services and (v)continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery. In addition, we maintain a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. This also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels.
We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 24,300, an increase of approximately 9,000 over the prior year end. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2005. Turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 14% for 2005. The vast majority of our turnover occurs in India, resulting in on-site annualized attrition rates below the global rate. In addition, attrition is weighted toward the most junior members of our staff.
We are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as way of reducing overall operating costs. We recently expanded our plans to construct additional fully-owned development centers to now include over 1.7million square feet as compared to previous plans, announced in October 2004 to add 900,000 square feet of space. The 1.7million square feet of facilities will be located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. The total construction expenditure related to this expanded program is estimated to the approximately $140 million an increase of approximately $64million when compared to the expansion program announced in October 2004, which we expect to fund primarily from current operations.
In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom Solutions, LLC (Fathom), a United States based company specializing in IT consulting in the telecommunications and financial services industries, for initial consideration of approximately $23.3 million in cash and stock. Additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April30, 2007 and will be recorded when the contingency is resolved. We completed this acquisition primarily to strengthen our service capabilities in the telecommunications industry. We will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry.
At December31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $424.0 million, an increase of approximately $109.2million compared to December31, 2004. Further, we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately $507.7million at the end of 2005; accordingly, we do not anticipate any near-term liquidity issues.
- 43 - Table of Contents On January1, 2006, we will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123R, which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs. We expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to reduce net income in 2006 by an amount slightly above the SFAS No.123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately $18 million for 2005. Factors that will affect our estimate of the SFAS 123R expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants, and changes to our stock price, volatility of our stock and risk-free interest rates during the year in 2006.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting, for certain fixed-bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition . Revenues related to our fixed-price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
- 44 - Table of Contents Income Taxes . Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income, as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate.
On an on-going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on-going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made.
Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export-oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten-year tax holiday expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to Indian income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. The tax holiday did not expire for any STPs in 2005. On March31, 2006, the tax holiday will expire for an additional STP; however, we do not expect the incremental Indian taxes due on the operating profits of this STP to have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as we anticipate the percentage of Indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in India will increase as a percentage of total Indian earnings in 2006. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (currently 33.66%) in effect at such time.
Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through December31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the - 45 - Table of Contents U.S. instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.23, we no longer accrue incremental United States taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. As of December31, 2005, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings and total foreign earnings, including unrepatriated Indian earnings, upon which no incremental U.S. taxes has been recorded is approximately $267 million and $283 million, respectively. If such post-2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2005. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on Indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment.
Goodwill.
We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December31, 2005, our goodwill balance was approximately $18.2million.
Long-lived Assets . In accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks . Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo-political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item1A, Risk Factors for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results.

Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measure, when read in conjunction with the companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the companys growth. Net income, as adjusted, for the year ended December31, 2005 excludes a one-time tax benefit of $12,411 in 2005 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the Act.
Year Ended December31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2004 Revenue . Revenue increased by 51.0%, or approximately $299.2 million, from approximately $586.7million during 2004 to approximately $885.8 million in 2005. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on-site/offshore delivery model, our expanding range of service offerings which allowed us to access a larger share of our customers IT budgets, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending, increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December31, 2004, including the acquisition of Fathom. In 2005, approximately 91% of our revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004 and the number of our active - 47 - Table of Contents customers as of year end increased to approximately 250 as compared to approximately 233 at the end of 2004. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately half of our year over year increase in revenue or approximately $150.5million. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 59% and 44%, respectively, compared to 2004 and represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues in 2005. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2005. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004.
Gross Profit . Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 50.1% or approximately $160.1million, from approximately $319.8million during 2004 to approximately $479.9million in 2005. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 52.1%, or approximately $139.1million, from approximately $266.9million during 2004 to approximately $405.9million during 2005. Gross profit margin was essentially flat, increasing from 45.5% of revenues during 2004 to 45.8% of revenues in 2005.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 53.0%, or approximately $79.1million, from approximately $149.2million during 2004 to approximately $228.3million during 2005, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.4% in 2004 to approximately 25.8% in 2005. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth.
Income from Operations . Income from operations increased 51.0%, or approximately $60.0million, from approximately $117.6million during 2004 to approximately $177.6 million during 2005, representing essentially unchanged operating margins of approximately 20.1% of revenues in 2005 and 20.0% of revenues in 2004.
Other Income/Expense, Net . Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income is primarily attributed to an increase in interest income from $4.4million during 2004 to approximately $9.0million during 2005 partially offset by a $1.3 million year-over-year reduction in other income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested balances and an increase in short-term interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes . The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $21.9million in 2004 to approximately $19.0million in 2005. The effective income tax rate decreased from 17.9% in 2004 to 10.3% in 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 is primarily attributed to the one-time benefit of approximately $12.4 - 48 - Table of Contents million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection the repatriation of $60.0million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one-time benefit was 17.0%, which decreased from the prior year primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday.
Net Income . Net income increased from approximately $100.2million in 2004 to approximately $166.3 million in 2005, representing 17.1% and 18.8% of revenues in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the one-time tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income as a percentage of revenues excluding the one-time benefit was 17.4%.
Year Ended December31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2003 Revenue . Revenue increased by 59.3%, or approximately $218.4million, from approximately $368.2million during 2003 to approximately $586.7million in 2004. This increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December31, 2003, including acquisitions. Specifically, our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately $120 million of the year over year increase. Demand for our IT consulting and technology services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers discretionary spending. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004 and 10.1% of our revenues in 2003. No other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2004 or 2003.
Gross Profit . Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60.1%, or approximately $120.1million, from approximately $199.7million during 2003 to approximately $319.8million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $98.4million, from approximately $168.5million during 2003 to approximately $266.9million during 2004. Gross profit margin decreased from 45.8% of revenues during 2003 to 45.5% of revenues in 2004. The decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable, in part, to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the United States dollar.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or approximately $53.0million, from approximately $96.2million during 2003 to approximately $149.2million during 2004, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.1% in 2003 to 25.4% in 2004. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the United States dollar.
- 49 - Table of Contents Income from Operations . Income from operations increased 62.7%, or approximately $45.3million, from approximately $72.3million during 2003 to approximately $117.6million during 2004, representing approximately 19.6% of revenues during 2003 and 20.0% of revenues during 2004. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years.

Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses and for the year ended December31, 2003, non-recurring split-off costs of $2.0million related to direct and incremental expenses ( e.g.
, legal and accounting fees, printing and registration costs) incurred by us directly related to our split-off from IMS Health. Interest income increased from $2.1million during 2003 to approximately $4.4million during 2004. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly higher interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes . The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $14.9million in 2003 to approximately $21.9million in 2004, with an effective tax rate of 20.6% in 2003 and 17.9% in 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed to Indias conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits.
Net Income . Net income increased from approximately $57.4million in 2003 to approximately $100.2million in 2004, representing approximately 15.6% and 17.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the one-time non-recurring split-off costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003.
Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve.
The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is - 50 - Table of Contents defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations.
Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2005 2004 2005 2004 2003 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial services $ 440,958 $ 290,432 $ 170,370 $ 150,526 51.8 $ 120,062 70.5 Healthcare 176,102 116,370 78,420 59,732 51.3 37,950 48.4 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 152,536 105,328 64,064 47,208 44.8 41,264 64.4 Other 116,234 74,543 55,377 41,691 55.9 19,166 34.6 Total revenues $ 885,830 $ 586,673 $ 368,231 $ 299,157 51.0 $ 218,442 59.3 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 153,542 $ 104,074 $ 52,412 $ 49,468 47.5 $ 51,662 98.6 Healthcare 71,226 47,294 31,912 23,932 50.6 15,382 48.2 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 46,210 38,842 24,569 7,368 19.0 14,273 58.1 Other 39,100 30,820 20,964 8,280 26.9 9,856 47.0 Total segment operating profit $ 310,078 $ 221,030 $ 129,857 $ 89,048 40.3 $ 91,173 70.2 Year Ended December31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2004 Financial Services Segment Revenue .

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $424.0million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i)expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii)continued development of new service lines; (iii)possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv)formation of joint ventures; and (v)general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December31, 2005, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $507.7 million as compared to working capital of approximately $338.9million, with no third party debt as of December31, 2004. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near-term liquidity issues.
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $159.8million for the year ended December31, 2005, $127.3million for the year ended December31, 2004 and $79.9million for the year ended December31, 2003. The increase in 2005 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2005, offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables and the timing of payment of accrued expenses. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $52.3million at December31, 2003 to approximately $96.4million at December31, 2004 and to approximately $154.0million at December31, 2005. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $9.5million at December31, 2003 to approximately $14.2million at December31, 2004 and increased to approximately $22.7million at December31, 2005. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2005 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of milestone billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December31, 2005, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 63days as compared to 59days as of December31, 2004 and 53days as of December31, 2003.
Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $204.5million for the year ended December31, 2005, $112.7million for the year ended December31, 2004 and $30.6million for - 54 - Table of Contents the year ended December31, 2003. The increase in each year was primarily related to increased investment of excess cash generated from operations in short-term investments to achieve a higher return on invested balances and greater investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore IT development centers.
Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $47.5 million for the year ended December31, 2005, $36.8million for the year ended December31, 2004 and $21.8million for the year ended December31, 2003. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock.
We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long-term capital requirements beyond this 12-month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings subsequent to January1, 2002 from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six-month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars, that was settled in January 2005. We entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the United States dollar. Our objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract was marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
Commitments and Contingencies We have expanded our plans to construct additional fully-owned IT development centers to now include over 1.7million square feet as compared to previous plans, announced in October 2004 to add 900,000 square feet of space. The 1.7million square feet of facilities will be located - 55 - Table of Contents in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. As of December31, 2005, we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $70.4 million related to this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $48.9 million has been spent to date.
As of December31, 2005, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Lessthan 1year 1-3 years 3-5 years Morethan 5years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 52,734 $ 13,848 $ 19,324 $ 14,738 $ 4,824 Fixed capital commitments (1) 21,502 21,502    Other purchase commitments (2) 9,708 5,162 4,546   Total $ 83,944 $ 40,512 $ 23,870 $ 14,738 $ 4,824 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program.
(2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.
In connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom, additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April30, 2007.
Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. Any additional payments relating to the achievement of post-acquisition financial and operating targets is expected to be funded by cash flows from operations.
We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there - 56 - Table of Contents can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows.
In connection with our Split-Off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will& Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will& Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows.
Exit Activity On June29, 2004, we announced our plans to wind-down operations at our development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March31, 2005. As of March31, 2005, we completed the wind-down of our Limerick development facility. During the year ended December31, 2004, we recorded expenses of approximately $1.5 million primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of $1.0 million through December31, 2004. During the year ended December31, 2005, we recorded additional expenses of approximately $0.1 million and made payments of approximately $0.6 million primarily for severance and retention bonuses. All costs have been paid as of December31, 2005.
Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 87% of our revenues are generated from customers located in the United States. However, a portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non-operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian Rupee in our Indian subsidiary.
- 57 - Table of Contents Related Party Transactions On February13, 2003 (the Split-Off Date), IMS Health distributed all of our ClassB common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the Split-Off). In connection with the exchange offer we incurred Split-Off costs of $2.0 million in 2003. As a result of the Split-Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split-Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split-Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6million in 2003. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split-Off Date, were approximately $22.7million.
Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No.154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No.3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No.154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when specific transition provisions are not provided. SFAS No.154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No.154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R), which is a revision of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No.123). SFAS No.123R supersedes APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No.25), and amends SFAS No.95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No.123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No.123. However, SFAS No.123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. In addition, SFAS No.123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods - 58 - Table of Contents after adoption. Total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules. SFAS No.123R is effective for our annual reporting period beginning January1, 2006.
We will adopt SFAS No.123R effective January1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method. Adoption of SFAS No.123R will reduce our gross margin, operating margin, reported net income and earnings per share because we currently use the intrinsic value method as permitted by APB No.25. Accordingly, no compensation expense is currently recognized for stock purchase rights granted under our (i)employee stock option plans since the exercise price equals the fair value of the underlying stock at date of grant and (ii)employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December31, 2006, we expect the annualized after-tax cost associated with expensing grants under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans, including an estimate of grants to be issued in 2006, to be slightly above the SFAS No.123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately $18 million for 2005. Factors that will affect our estimate of the SFAS 123R expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants, and changes to our stock price, volatility of our stock and risk-free interest rates during the year in 2006.
Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward-looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the sectionentitled Item1A. Risk Factors.
Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six-month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars that was settled in January 2005. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or - 59 - Table of Contents depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources.
We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December31, 2005, we had $424.0million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short-term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily AAA rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard& Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer.
Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item8 are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A list of the financial statements filed herewith is found at Item15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule, and Reports on Form 8-K.
Item9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable.
Item9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December31, 2005. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were (1)effective in that they were designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer by others within those entities, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and (2)effective in that they provide that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
- 60 - Table of Contents Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of all information presented in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the F-2 Table of Contents Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

F-7 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) 1. Basis of Presentation Description of Business.
Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (Cognizant or the Company) is a leading provider of custom Information Technology (IT) consulting and technology services as well as outsourcing services for Global 2000 Business companies located in North America, Europe and Asia. Cognizants core competencies include Technology Strategy Consulting, Complex Systems Development, Enterprise Software Package Implementation, Data Warehousing& Business Intelligence, Application Testing, Application Maintenance, Infrastracture Management and Vertically-Oriented Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). The Company tailors its services to specific industries, and utilizes an integrated on-site/offshore business model. This seamless on-site/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on-site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in India.
Organization.
Cognizant began its IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house technology development center for The Dun& Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun-off from the Dun& Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June24, 1998, Cognizant completed its initial public offering of its ClassA common stock. On June30, 1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health Incorporated (IMS Health). Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding stock of Cognizant.
Split-Off from IMS Health . On February13, 2003 (the Split-Off Date), IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS stockholders (the Split-Off). As a result of the Split-Off, IMS Health and its affiliates are no longer related parties of Cognizant as of the Split-Off Date. Accordingly, only services rendered to or received from IMS Health and its affiliates during the period January1, 2003 to the Split-Off Date are classified as related party transactions. Services rendered to or received from IMS Health subsequent to the Split-Off Date are classified as third party transactions. See Note11.
In connection with the Split-Off, Cognizant was obligated to pay the costs associated with the Split-Off (the Split-Off Costs) in connection with the exchange offer under the provisions of an Intercompany Agreement, dated as of May15, 1998. The Intercompany Agreement provided that Cognizant would pay its own costs, without reimbursement, and the costs of IMS Health (other than underwriting discounts, commissions and certain other specified costs) necessary to facilitate a sale or spin-off of IMS Healths ownership interest in the Company.
In 2003, Cognizant incurred direct and incremental costs of $2,010 resulting from external costs contractually incurred related to the Split-Off. Such costs included direct legal, accounting, printing and other costs, including a non-cash charge calculated in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Related Interpretations (APB No.25) of approximately $488 related to the retention, acceleration and extended life of Cognizant common stock options held by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on the Split-Off Date as a condition of the Split-Off. Such former Directors were, as of the Split-Off Date, officers of IMS Health.
F - 8 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) Of the total $3,690 of Split-Off Costs incurred and recorded, including approximately $1,680 recorded in 2002, all costs were paid as of December31, 2003.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation . The consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for all periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents . The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents included time deposits of $37,229 at December31, 2005. There were no time deposits included in cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2004. In previously issued financial statements, short-term investments in auction-rate securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company began to classify its investment in auction-rate securities as short-term investments. In previously issued financial statements such short-term investments included in cash and cash equivalents were $94,150, $49,850, $57,100 and $34,550 at December31, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The change in presentation of auction-rate securities had no effect on the amounts of total current assets, total assets, net income or cash flow from operations of the Company for previously reported periods. Prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.

The Companys short-term investments consists of time deposits which mature in less than one year, valued at cost, which approximates fair value and available-for-sale securities valued at fair value. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in interest income. Available-for-sale securities consist primarily of auction-rate securities with auction rate reset periods of less than three months. The Companys investment in auction-rate securities consist of investment grade municipal and corporate debt securities.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables.
Unbilled Accounts Receivable.
Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenues on contracts to be billed, in subsequent periods, as per the terms of the related contracts.
Short-term Financial Assets and Liabilities Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities are short-term in nature and, accordingly, their carrying values approximates fair value.
Property and Equipment . Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Maintenance and repairs are F - 10 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) expensed as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. Deposits paid towards acquisition of long-lived assets and the cost of assets not put in use before the balance sheet date are disclosed under the caption capital work-in-progress in Note5.
Internal Use Software . Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized, including the salaries and benefits of employees that are directly involved in the installation of such software. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line method over the lesser of three years or its useful life. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles . The Company does not amortize goodwill, but instead tests goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually or as circumstances warrant. If an impairment is indicated, a write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows) is recorded. Other intangibles represent primarily customer relationships and assembled workforce, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Long-Lived Assets . The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, the Company will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The impairment loss would equal the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Revenue Recognition . The Companys services are entered into on either a time-and-materials or fixed-price basis. Revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts that provide for highly complex information technology application development services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total value of revenue is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Revenues related to fixed-priced contracts that provide solely for application maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis or as services are rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contractual terms. Expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period.
Effective July1, 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Consensus 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21). For contracts with multiple deliverables, the Company evaluates at the inception of each new contract all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. For arrangements with multiple units of accounting, primarily fixed-price contracts that provide both application maintenance and application development services and certain application maintenance contracts, arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting, where separable, based on their relative fair values and revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting based on the Companys revenue recognition policy described above.
F - 11 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Fixed-price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related to fixed-price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, are recognized as either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates of certain fixed-price contracts are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. Warranty provisions generally exist under such contracts for a period of ninety days past contract completion and costs related to such provisions are accrued at the time the related revenues are recorded.
Revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when agreements or work orders are signed or payment is received; however, the cost related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services are rendered.
For all services, revenue is recognized when, and if, evidence of an arrangement is obtained and the other criteria to support revenue recognition are met, including the price is fixed or determinable, services have been rendered and collectibility is assured.
The Company accounts for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses as revenues. Cost of revenues is exclusive of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment.
Accounting for Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans.
The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans (as more fully described in Note 10) under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Related Interpretations (APB No.25).
Except for approximately $488 calculated in accordance with APB No.25 related to the retention, acceleration and extended life of Cognizant common stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant included in Split-Off Costs, no employee stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, and for the employee stock purchase plan, the discount does not exceed 15%.
Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with the method prescribed by the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No.123), the Companys net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: F - 12 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) December31, 2005 2004 2003 Net income, as reported $ 166,266 $ 100,243 $ 57,365 Add: Stock-based compensation expense, net of related tax benefit, included in net income   488 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards, net of related tax benefits 17,990 15,193 15,495 Pro forma net income $ 148,276 $ 85,050 $ 42,358 Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share, as reported $ 1.22 $ 0.77 $ 0.46 Pro forma- basic earnings per share $ 1.09 $ 0.65 $ 0.34 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.13 $ 0.70 $ 0.42 Pro forma- diluted earnings per share $ 1.01 $ 0.60 $ 0.31 For purposes of pro forma disclosures only, the fair value for all Company options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option model with the following weighted average assumptions: 2005 2004 2003 Years ended December31, Dividend yield 0 % 0 % 0 % Volatility factor 39%-46 % 46 % 45 % Expected life (in years): Options 4.0 4.0 4.0 Stock purchase plans .25 .25 .25 Weighted average risk-free interest rate: Options 3.77 % 3.11 % 2.70 % Employee stock purchase plans 2.81 % 1.26 % 0.96 % Weighted average fair value: Options $ 16.52 $ 10.06 $ 4.40 Employee stock purchase plans $ 8.51 $ 5.03 $ 2.59 See Note 10 for additional information relating to the Companys stock plans.
Foreign Currency Translation . The assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries other than the Companys Indian subsidiary (Cognizant India), are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For Cognizant India, the functional currency is F - 13 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between Cognizant India and its U.S. affiliates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in the caption other income (expense), net on the Companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction (losses) / gains, which are included in the results of operations, totaled $(1,339), $73 and $(199) for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gains and losses from balance sheet translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and represents the only item included in such caption.
Foreign Currency Forward Contract . During July 2004, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six-month term and notional amount of $12,500, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars that was settled in January 2005. The Company entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of its foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of the Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the U.S. dollar. The Companys objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above.
The Company has accounted for this financial derivative in accordance with SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. This foreign currency contract does not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.133. Accordingly, the foreign currency forward contract is marked-to-market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on the Companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The Company recorded a realized gain / (loss) on the foreign currency forward contract of $162 and $(989) for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Exit Activities One-time termination benefits are recognized and measured at fair value at the communication date if the employee will not be retained beyond a minimum retention period (i.e., either a legal notification period or 60 days, if no legal requirement exists). For employees that will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, a liability is accrued ratably over the future service period.
On June29, 2004, the Company announced its plans to wind-down operations at its development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March31, 2005. As of March31, 2005, the Company completed the wind-down of its Limerick development facility. During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company recorded expenses of approximately $1,500 primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of approximately $1,000 through December31, 2004. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded additional expenses of approximately $100 and made payments of approximately $600 primarily for severance and retention bonuses. All costs have been paid as of December31, 2005.
F - 14 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) Use of Estimates . The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on-going basis, management reevaluates these estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed-bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and related deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual amounts may vary from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Risks and Uncertainties . Principally, all of the Companys IT development centers, including a majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. From time to time, the Company will engage in hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo-political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local or cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers.
Concentration of Credit Risk . Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, investments in short-term securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with high credit quality financial institutions, invests in investment-grade short-term debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer. Trade accounts receivables are dispersed across many customers operating in different industries; therefore, concentration of credit risk is limited.
Income Taxes.
The Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The F - 15 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax benefits earned on exercise of employee stock options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to additional paid-in capital.
Earnings Per Share (EPS).
Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS includes all potential dilutive common stock in the weighted average shares outstanding.
Reclassifications . Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.
New Accounting Standards - Issued but Not Yet Effective In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No.154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No.3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No.154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when specific transition provisions are not provided. SFAS No.154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No.154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123R), which is a revision of SFAS No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No.123R supersedes APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No.25), and amends SFAS No.95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No.123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No.123. However, SFAS No.123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. In addition, SFAS No.123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules. SFAS No.123R is effective for the Companys annual reporting period beginning January1, 2006.
The Company will adopt SFAS No., 123R on January1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method. Adoption of SFAS No.123R will reduce reported net income and earnings per share because the Company currently uses the intrinsic value method as permitted by APB No.25. Accordingly, no compensation expense is currently recognized for stock purchase rights F - 16 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) granted under the Companys (i)employee stock option plans since the exercise price equals the fair value of the underlying stock at date of grant and (ii)employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December31, 2006, the Company expects the annualized after-tax cost associated with expensing grants under the Companys employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans, including an estimate of grants to be issued in 2006, to be slightly above the pro forma impact under SFAS No.123 of $17,990 in 2005.
3. Acquisitions In April 2005, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Fathom Solutions, LLC (Fathom), a U.S. based company specializing in IT consulting in the telecommunications and financial services industries, for initial consideration of approximately $23,300 (including deal fees and consideration for delivery by sellers of net assets above the contractual target) in cash and stock. The Company made cash payments of approximately $18,600 and issued 113,225 shares of ClassA common stock valued at $4,722 related to the acquisition. Additional purchase price, not to exceed $16,000, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April30, 2007 and will be recorded when the contingency is resolved. The Company completed this acquisition primarily to strengthen its service capabilities in the telecommunications industry.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company has allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on an appraisal of their fair values, including approximately $9,100 to goodwill and $6,750 to intangible assets, principally customer relationships. The intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of 9.8years. For the year ended December31, 2005, amortization of $552 related to the acquisition of amortizable intangible assets of Fathom has been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
On February27, 2004, the Company acquired Ygyan Consulting Private Ltd. (Ygyan), an India-based SAP services provider, for $1,676. Ygyan was acquired to increase the Companys SAP service capabilities.
On November24, 2003, the Company acquired the stock of Infopulse Nederland B.V. (Infopulse), a Netherlands-based information technology services company specializing in the banking and financial services industry for approximately $6,900 (including approximately $400 of direct deal costs) of which $1,183 was paid in 2005. As the earnout targets were not achieved, no additional purchase price payments are due to the sellers. This acquisition will allow the Company to improve its service capabilities in the Benelux region by adding local client partners, industry expertise and local language capability.
On April1, 2003, the Company acquired the U.S.-based company of ACES International, Inc. (ACES), that specializes in Customer Relationship Management solutions, serving clients in healthcare, financial services and telecommunications industries, for approximately $4,700 (including approximately $500 of direct deal costs).
F - 17 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) The Company recorded approximately $7,600 of goodwill and $1,800 of intangible assets, principally customer relationships, in connection with the 2003 acquisitions. The intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of 9.3years.
The Company has accounted for the acquisitions of Fathom, Ygyan, Infopulse and ACES as business combinations under the provisions of SFAS No.141, Business Combinations. The operating results of Fathom, Ygyan, Infopulse and ACES have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, effective April16, 2005,February27, 2004,November24, 2003 and April1, 2003, respectively. The acquisitions in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows.

Contractual maturities of available-for-sale-securities at December31, 2005 are as follows: $8,953 in 2006 and $218,110 maturing after 2019. The Companys investments in auction-rate securities generally have contractual maturities in excess of one year; however, they provide liquidity to the Company every ninety days or less when interest rates are reset through a Dutch auction process. The Company invests in investment grade auction-rate securities and, to date, has not participated in any failed auctions.

The employees provident fund, pension and family pension plans are statutory defined contribution retirement benefit plans. Under the plans, employees contribute up to 12% of their base compensation, which is matched by an equal contribution by Cognizant India. Contribution expense recognized was $3,758, $2,254 and $1,310 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Cognizant India also maintains a statutory gratuity plan that is a statutory post-employment benefit plan providing defined lump sum benefits. Cognizant India makes annual contributions to an employees gratuity fund established with a government-owned insurance corporation to fund a portion of the estimated obligation. The Company accounts for the gratuity plan in accordance with the provisions of EITF 88-1, Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for a Defined Benefit Pension Plan. Accordingly, the Companys liability for the gratuity plan reflects the undiscounted benefit obligation payable as of the balance sheet date which was based upon the employees salary and years of service. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the amount accrued under the gratuity plan was $7,535 and $5,182, respectively. Expense recognized by the Company was $3,477, $2,752 and $1,112 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

For Federal purposes, these losses have expiration dates ranging from December31, 2022 through December31, 2025. For state purposes, the date F - 22 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) of expiration varies but will generally be less than or equal to the Federal expiration period. The Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10,000, of which approximately $6,700 relates to pre-acquisition net operating losses. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on the foreign net operating loss carryforwards. If tax benefits are recognized through reduction of the valuation allowance, approximately $2,100 of such benefits will reduce goodwill. The majority of foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date .
Cognizants Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export-oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten-year tax holiday period expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by Marchof 2009. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the effect of the income tax holiday was to reduce the overall income tax provision and increase net income by approximately $34,664, $24,208 and $12,423, respectively, and increase diluted EPS by $0.24, $0.17 and $0.09, respectively.
Prior to January1, 2002, it was the Companys intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States. Accordingly, Cognizant provided deferred income taxes on such pre2002 undistributed earnings. During the first quarter of 2002, Cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, Cognizant intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January1, 2002, pursuant to APB No.23, Cognizant no longer accrues incremental U.S. taxes on all Indian earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December31, 2005, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings and total foreign earnings, including unrepatriated Indian earnings, upon which no incremental U.S. taxes has been recorded is approximately $267,000 and $283,000, respectively. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, Cognizant will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation.
On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was enacted into law. The Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Under the provisions of the Act, in December 2005, the Company repatriated $60,000 of undistributed Indian earnings that were not considered permanently reinvested under APB No.23 and recorded a net income tax benefit of $12,411, consisting of a reversal of deferred income tax liabilities of $22,939 partially offset by current U.S. and Indian income taxes of $10,528. The U.S. income tax benefit was attributed to the fact F - 23 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) that U.S. taxes due under the Act were substantially less than the amount the Company previously accrued, based on the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, on such undistributed Indian earnings. The repatriation reduced the Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2005 from 17.0% to 10.3% and increased basic and diluted EPS by $0.09 and $0.08, respectively. As of December31, 2005, the Company has an accrual of approximately $6,100 on remaining pre-2002 undistributed Indian earnings that the Company intends to repatriate in the future.
The Company will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of all Indian earnings after December31, 2001. Deferred U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings from other foreign entities have not been provided for as such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested.
10. Employee Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Key Employees Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of up to 8,385,000 stock options (each option exercisable into one (1)share of the Companys ClassA common stock) to eligible employees. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. These options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over four years and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date.
The Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of up to 858,000 stock options (each option exercisable into one (1)share of the Companys ClassA common stock) to eligible directors. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. These options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over two years and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date.
On June14, 2005, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (the Incentive Plan), to (i)increase the maximum number of shares of ClassA Common Stock reserved for issuance from 36,000,000 to 37,500,000 shares and to reserve an additional 1,500,000 shares of ClassA Common Stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights or for the issuance of other awards granted under the Incentive Plan, (ii)provide that repricing of stock options may not occur without stockholder approval, (iii)provide for minimum vesting periods for stock based awards, other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, (iv)provide that stock options may not be granted below fair market value, and (v)provide that all material amendments to the Incentive Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval. All options granted under the Incentive Plan are exercisable into one (1)share of the Companys ClassA common stock, have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over four years, unless specified otherwise, and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
On May26, 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan) that provides for the issuance of up to 3,000,000 shares of ClassA common stock to eligible employees. The Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to designate, in advance of specified purchase periods, a percentage of compensation to be withheld from their F - 24 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) pay and applied towards the purchase of such number of whole shares of ClassA common stock as can be purchased at a price of 90% of the lesser of (a)the fair market value of a share of ClassA common stock on the first date of the purchase period; or (b)the fair market value of a share of ClassA common stock on the last date of the purchase period. No employee can purchase more than $25 worth of stock annually, and no stock can be purchased by any person which would result in the purchaser owning more than five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company.
During the year ended December31, 2005, approximately 363,847 shares of ClassA common stock were purchased by employees under the Purchase Plan. At December31, 2005, there were approximately 2,395,865 shares available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.
A summary of the Companys stock option activity, and related information is as follows as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2005 2004 2004 2003 2003 Shares WeightedAverage Exercise Price Shares WeightedAverage Exercise Price Shares WeightedAverage Exercise Price Outstanding at beginning of year 19,750,904 $ 10.36 24,943,330 $ 7.40 22,857,306 $ 4.84 Granted 1,110,100 $ 42.26 3,262,196 $ 25.47 8,940,600 $ 11.49 Exercised (4,691,724 ) $ 6.98 (5,261,972 ) $ 5.91 (5,957,976 ) $ 3.68 Cancelled (610,725 ) $ 19.69 (3,186,250 ) $ 9.93 (895,100 ) $ 7.70 Expired (1,500 ) $ 19.53 (6,400 ) $ 9.12 (1,500 ) $ 6.78 Outstanding - end of year 15,557,055 $ 13.29 19,750,904 $ 10.36 24,943,330 $ 7.40 Exercisable - end of year 8,894,690 $ 7.90 9,195,954 $ 5.79 8,003,580 $ 4.37 At December31, 2005, 3,264,115 options (each option exercisable into one share of the Companys ClassA common stock) were available for future issuance under the Companys option plans.

11. Related Party Transactions and Transactions with Affiliates Revenues . The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides certain IT services to IMS Health. As a result of the Split-Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party to the Company as of the Split-Off Date. Accordingly, revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split-Off Date are classified as third party revenues. The Company recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling $2,575 in 2003. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split-Off Date, were approximately $22,675.
Services . IMS Health provided the Company with certain administrative services under the provisions of an amended and restated Intercompany Services Agreement entered into in connection with the Split-Off. In 2003 and prior periods, IMS Health permitted the Company to participate in certain of IMS Healths business insurance plans and provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have since been transitioned to the Company. Total costs charged in connection with these services during the period January1, 2003 through the Split-Off Date were $28.
The Company has a strategic relationship with The Trizetto Group Inc. (Trizetto) that includes helping its healthcare customers integrate Trizettos products with their existing information systems and, within Trizetto, supporting further development of these software applications. As of the Split-Off Date, IMS Health owned approximately 26.4% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. The Company recorded revenues from Trizetto of approximately $831 from January1, 2003 through the Split-Off Date. The Company recorded expenses related to Trizetto commissions of approximately $9 from January1, 2003 through the Split-Off Date.
Pension Plans . In 2003, certain U.S. employees of the Company participated in IMS Healths defined benefit pension plans. The plans are cash balance pension plans under which six percent F - 26 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) of creditable compensation plus interest is credited to the employees retirement account on a monthly basis. The cash balance earns monthly investment credits based on the 30-year Treasury bond yield. At the time of retirement, the vested employees account balance is actuarially converted into an annuity. The Companys cost for these plans was included in the allocation of expense from IMS Health for employee benefits plans.
12. Commitments The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2014. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2005 are as follows: 2006 $ 13,848 2007 10,405 2008 8,919 2009 8,230 2010 6,508 Thereafter 4,824 Total minimum lease payments $ 52,734 Rental expense totaled $17,499, $11,560 and $7,782 for years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
As of December31, 2005, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $70,400 related to this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $48,900 has been spent to date. See Note16.
13. Contingencies The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of the Companys engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Companys responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering its software development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect the Company from liability for damages. Although the Company has general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against the Company that F - 27 Table of Contents COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands, except share and per share data) exceed available insurance coverage or changes in the Companys insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January7, 2003, with IMS Health (the Distribution Agreement), that provides, among other things, that IMS Health and the Company will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will& Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations of the Company made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will& Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If the Company breaches any of its representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
14. Segment Information The Companys reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. The Companys sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve.
The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the Companys development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations of the Company. Additionally, management has determined that it is not practical to allocate identifiable assets, by segment, since such assets are used interchangeably among the segments.
