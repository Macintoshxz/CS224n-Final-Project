Business G ENERAL Dominion , headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is one of the nations largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominions strategy is to be a leading provider of electricity, natural gas and related services to customers primarily in the eastern region of the U.S. As of December31, 2015, Dominions portfolio of assets includes approximately 24,300 MW of generating capacity, 6,500 miles of electric transmission lines, 57,300 miles of electric distribution lines, 12,200 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline and 22,000 miles of gas distribution pipeline, exclusive of service lines. As of December31, 2015, Dominion serves over 5million utility and retail energy customers in 14 states and operates one of the nations largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 933 bcf of storage capacity.
In March 2014, Dominion formed Dominion Midstream, an MLP designed to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets. In October 2014, Dominion Midstream launched its initial public offering and issued 20,125,000 common units (including 2,625,000 common units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) representing limited partner interests. Dominion has recently and may continue to investigate opportunities to acquire assets that meet its strategic objective for Dominion Midstream. At December31, 2015, Dominion owns the general partner and 64.1% of the limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream, which owns a preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, DCG and a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Dominion Midstream is consolidated by Dominion, and is an SEC registrant. However, its Form 10-K is filed separately and is not combined herein.
Dominion is focused on expanding its investment in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution and regulated natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.
Dominion continues to expand and improve its regulated and long-term contracted electric and natural gas businesses, in accordance with its existing five-year capital investment program. A major impetus for this program is to meet the anticipated increase in demand in its electric utility service territory. Other drivers for the capital investment program include the construction of infrastructure to handle the increase in natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, to upgrade Dominions gas and electric transmission and distribution networks, and to meet environmental requirements and standards set by various regulatory bodies. Investments in utility solar generation are expected to be a focus in meeting such environmental requirements, particularly in Virginia. Blue Racer is investing in natural gas gathering and processing assets in Ohio and West Virginia, targeting primarily the Utica Shale formation. In September 2014, Dominion announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, to increase natural gas supplies in the region.
Dominion has transitioned to a more regulated, less volatile earnings mix as evidenced by its capital investments in regulated infrastructure and infrastructure whose output is sold under long-term purchase agreements, as well as dispositions of certain merchant generation facilities during 2013 and the sale of the electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014. Dominions nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities and natural gas retail energy marketing operations.Dominions operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas.
Virginia Power , headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and incorporated in Virginia in 1909 as a Virginia public service corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion and a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and North Carolina. In Virginia, Virginia Power conducts business under the name Dominion Virginia Power and primarily serves retail customers. In North Carolina, it conducts business under the name Dominion North Carolina Power and serves retail customers located in the northeastern region of the state, excluding certain municipalities. In addition, Virginia Power sells electricity at wholesale prices to rural electric cooperatives, municipalities and into wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Powers stock is owned by Dominion.
Dominion Gas, a limited liability company formed in September 2013, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion and a holding company. It serves as the intermediate parent company for the majority of Dominions regulated natural gas operating subsidiaries, which conduct business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in Ohio, and gas gathering and processing activities primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Dominion Gas principal wholly-owned subsidiaries are DTI, East Ohio and Dominion Iroquois. DTI is an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company serving a broad mix of customers such as local gas distribution companies, marketers, interstate and intrastate pipelines, electric power generators and natural gas producers. The DTI system links to other major pipelines and markets in the mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest including Dominions Cove Point pipeline. DTI also operates one of the largest underground natural gas storage systems in the U.S. and is a producer and supplier of NGLs. East Ohio is a regulated natural gas distribution operation serving residential, commercial and industrial gas sales and transportation customers. Its service territory includes Cleveland, Akron, Canton, Youngstown and other eastern and western Ohio communities. Dominion Iroquois holds a 24.72% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, a FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline in New York and Connecticut. All of Dominion Gas membership interests are owned by Dominion.
Amounts and information disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power and/or Dominion Gas, where applicable.

10 Table of Contents For additional financial information on operating segments, including revenues from external customers, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on operating revenue related to the Companies principal products and services, see Notes 2 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
DVP The DVP Operating Segment of Dominion and Virginia Power includes Virginia Powers regulated electric transmission and distribution (including customer service) operations, which serve approximately 2.5million residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina.
DVPs existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $7.7 billion from 2016 through 2020 to upgrade or add new transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory and maintain reliability. The proposed electric delivery infrastructure projects are intended to address both continued customer growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. In addition, data centers continue to contribute to anticipated demand growth.
Revenue provided by electric distribution operations is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Variability in earnings is driven primarily by changes in rates, weather, customer growth and other factors impacting consumption such as the economy and energy conservation, in addition to operating and maintenance expenditures. Operationally, electric distribution continues to focus on improving service levels while striving to reduce costs and link investments to operational results. SAIDI performance results, excluding major events, were 120 minutes at the end of 2015, up from the three-year average of 113 minutes, due to increased weather related outages. Virginia Powers overall customer satisfaction, however, improved year over year when compared to its 2014 score in the South Large segment of J.D. Power and Associates rankings. In the future, safety, electric service reliability and customer service will remain key focus areas for electric distribution.
Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission operations is based primarily on rates approved by FERC. The profitability of this business is dependent on its ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings primarily results from changes in rates and the timing of property additions, retirements and depreciation.
Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM wholesale electricity markets. Consistent with the increased authority given to NERC by EPACT, Virginia Powers electric transmission operations are committed to meeting NERC standards, modernizing its infrastructure and maintaining superior system reliability. Virginia Powers electric transmission operations will continue to focus on safety, operational performance, NERC compliance and execution of PJMs RTEP.
C OMPETITION DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power There is no competition for electric distribution service within Virginia Powers service territory in Virginia and North Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. Historically, since its electric transmission facilities are integrated into PJM and electric transmission services are administered by PJM, there was no competition in relation to transmission service provided to customers within the PJM region. However, competition from non-incumbent PJM transmission owners for development, construction and ownership of certain transmission facilities in Virginia Powers service territory is now permitted pursuant to FERC Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build transmission lines in Virginia Powers service area in the future and could allow Dominion to seek opportunities to build facilities in other service territories.
R EGULATION DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Virginia Powers electric retail service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. Virginia Powers wholesale electric transmission rates, tariffs and terms of service are subject to regulation by FERC. Electric transmission siting authority remains the jurisdiction of the Virginia and North Carolina Commissions. However, EPACT provides FERC with certain backstop authority for transmission siting. See State Regulations and Federal Regulations in Regulation and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a discussion of the February 2015 amendment to the Regulation Act and the 2015 Biennial Review Order.
P ROPERTIES DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Virginia Power has approximately 6,500 miles of electric transmission lines of 69 kV or more located in the states of North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Portions of Virginia Powers electric transmission lines cross national parks and forests under permits entitling the federal government to use, at specified charges, any surplus capacity that may exist in these lines. While Virginia Power owns and maintains its electric transmission facilities, they are a part of PJM, which coordinates the planning, operation, emergency assistance and exchange of capacity and energy for such facilities.
As a part of PJMs RTEP process, PJM authorized the following material reliability projects (including Virginia Powers estimated cost):  Surry-to-Skiffes Creek-to-Whealton ($150 million);  Dooms-to-Lexington ($112 million);  Cunningham-to-Elmont ($106 million);  Landstown voltage regulation ($70 million);  Warrenton (including Remington CT-to-Warrenton, Vint Hill-to-Wheeler-to-Gainesville, and Vint Hill and Wheeler switching stations) ($105 million); 11 Table of Contents  Carolina-to-Kerr Dam ($58 million);  Remington/Gordonsville/Pratts Area Improvement (including Remington-to-Gordonsville, and new Gordonsville substation transformer) ($104 million);  Kings Dominion-to-Fredericksburg ($51 million); and  Cunningham-to-Dooms ($110 million).
Over the next 5 years, Virginia Power plans to increase transmission substation physical security and to invest in a new system operations center. Virginia Power expects to invest $300 million-$400 million during that time to strengthen its electrical system to better protect critical equipment, enhance its spare equipment process and create multiple levels of security.
In addition, Virginia Powers electric distribution network includes approximately 57,300 miles of distribution lines, exclusive of service level lines, in Virginia and North Carolina. The grants for most of its electric lines contain rights-of-way that have been obtained from the apparent owners of real estate, but underlying titles have not been examined. Where rights-of-way have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many electric lines are on publicly-owned property, where permission to operate can be revoked.
Virginia legislation in 2014 provides for the recovery of costs, subject to approval by the Virginia Commission, for Virginia Power to move approximately 4,000 miles of electric distribution lines underground. The program, designed to reduce restoration outage time, has an annual investment cap of approximately $175 million and is expected to be implemented over the next decade. In December 2015, Virginia Power re-filed its application with the Virginia Commission seeking approval to place its most outage-prone overhead distribution lines underground as part of the initial phase of this program.
S OURCES OF E NERGY S UPPLY DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power DVPs supply of electricity to serve Virginia Power customers is produced or procured by Dominion Generation. See Dominion Generation for additional information.
S EASONALITY DVP Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power DVPs earnings vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature, the impact of storms and other catastrophic weather events, and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. Generally, the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. An increase in heating degree days for DVPs electric utility-related operations does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days, due to seasonal pricing differentials and because alternative heating sources are more readily available.
Dominion Generation The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power includes the generation operations of the Virginia Power regu lated electric utility and its related energy supply operations. Virginia Powers utility generation operations primarily serve the supply requirements for the DVP segments utility customers.
The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Dominion includes Virginia Powers generation facilities and its related energy supply operations as well as the generation operations of Dominions merchant fleet and energy marketing and price risk management activities for these assets.
Dominion Generations existing five-year electric utility investment plan includes spending approximately $8.0billion from 2016 through 2020 to construct new generation capacity to meet growing electricity demand within its utility service territory and to continue to replace coal-fired generating capacity with less carbon-intensive natural gas and solar. The most significant project currently under construction is Brunswick County, which is estimated to cost approximately $1.2 billion, excluding financing costs. See Properties and Environmental Strategy for additional information on this and other utility projects.
In addition, Dominions merchant fleet has acquired and developed numerous renewable generation projects, which include a fuel cell generation facility in Connecticut and solar generation facilities in California, Indiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Utah and Connecticut. The output of these facilities is sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally ranging from 15 to 25 years. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain solar projects.
Earnings for the Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Virginia Power primarily result from the sale of electricity generated by its utility fleet. Revenue is based primarily on rates established by state regulatory authorities and state law. Approximately 80% of revenue comes from serving Virginia jurisdictional customers. Base rates for the Virginia jurisdiction are set using a modified cost-of-service rate model, and are generally designed to allow an opportunity to recover the cost of providing utility service and earn a reasonable return on investments used to provide that service. Earnings variability may arise when revenues are impacted by factors not reflected in current rates, such as the impact of weather on customers demand for services. Likewise, earnings may reflect variations in the timing or nature of expenses as compared to those contemplated in current rates, such as labor and benefit costs, capacity expenses, and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages. The cost of fuel and purchased power is generally collected through fuel cost-recovery mechanisms established by regulators and does not materially impact net income. The cost of new generation facilities is generally recovered through rate adjustment clauses in Virginia. Variability in earnings from rate adjustment clauses reflects changes in the authorized ROE and the carrying amount of these facilities, which are largely driven by the timing and amount of capital investments, as well as depreciation. See Electric Regulation in Virginia under Regulation and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The Dominion Generation Operating Segment of Dominion derives its earnings primarily from the sale of electricity generated by Virginia Powers utility and Dominions merchant generation assets, as well as from associated capacity and ancillary services. Variability in earnings provided by Dominions nonrenewable merchant fleet relates to changes in market-based prices received for electricity and capacity. Market-based prices for electricity are largely dependent on commodity prices, primarily natural gas, and 12 Table of Contents the demand for electricity, which is primarily dependent upon weather. Capacity prices are dependent upon resource requirements in relation to the supply available (both existing and new) in the forward capacity auctions, which are held approximately three years in advance of the associated delivery year. Dominion manages the electric price volatility of its merchant fleet by hedging a substantial portion of its expected near-term energy sales with derivative instruments. Variability also results from changes in the cost of fuel consumed, labor and benefits and the timing, duration and costs of scheduled and unscheduled outages.
C OMPETITION Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Virginia Powers generation operations are not subject to significant competition as only a limited number of its Virginia jurisdictional electric utility customers have retail choice. See Regulation-State Regulations-Electric for more information. Currently, North Carolina does not offer retail choice to electric customers.
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion Dominion Generations recently acquired and developed renewable generation projects are not subject to significant competition as the output from these facilities is primarily sold under long-term power purchase agreements with terms generally lasting between 15 and 25 years. Competition for the nonrenewable merchant fleet is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction by others of generating assets and transmission capacity, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities and other factors.These competitive factors may negatively impact the merchant fleets ability to profit from the sale of electricity and related products and services.
Unlike Dominion Generations regulated generation fleet, its nonrenewable merchant generation fleet is dependent on its ability to operate in a competitive environment and does not have a predetermined rate structure that provides for a rate of return on its capital investments. Dominion Generations nonrenewable merchant assets operate within functioning RTOs and primarily compete on the basis of price. Competitors include other generating assets bidding to operate within the RTOs. These RTOs have clearly identified market rules that ensure the competitive wholesale market is functioning properly. Dominion Generations nonrenewable merchant units compete in the wholesale market with other generators to sell a variety of products including energy, capacity and ancillary services. It is difficult to compare various types of generation given the wide range of fuels, fuel procurement strategies, efficiencies and operating characteristics of the fleet within any given RTO. However, Dominion applies its expertise in operations, dispatch and risk management to maximize the degree to which its nonrenewable merchant fleet is competitive compared to similar assets within the region.
R EGULATION Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Virginia Powers utility generation fleet and Dominions merchant generation fleet are subject to regulation by FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal, state and local authorities. Virginia Powers utility generation fleet is also subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission. See Regulation, Future Issues and Other Matters in Item7. MD&A and Notes13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The Clean Power Plan and related proposed rules discussed represent a significant regulatory development affecting this segment. See Future Issues and Other Matters in Item7. MD&A.
P ROPERTIES For a listing of Dominions and Virginia Powers existing generation facilities, see Item2. Properties.
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power The generation capacity of Virginia Powers electric utility fleet totals approximately 20,000 MW. The generation mix is diversified and includes coal, nuclear, gas, oil, hydro, renewables and power purchase agreements. Virginia Powers generation facilities are located in Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina and serve load in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.
Virginia Power is developing, financing and constructing new generation capacity to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory. Significant projects under construction or development are set forth below:  In August 2013, the Virginia Commission authorized the construction of Brunswick County, which is estimated to cost approximately $1.2 billion, excluding financing costs. Construction of the facility commenced in the third quarter of 2013 with commercial operations expected to begin in mid-2016. Brunswick County is expected to offset the expected reduction in capacity caused by the retirement of coal-fired units at Chesapeake in December 2014 and at Yorktown as early as 2017, primarily due to the cost of compliance with MATS.
Virginia Power has filed for approval to construct certain solar facilities in Virginia. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Virginia Power is considering the construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this project.
The BOEM auctioned approximately 113,000 acres of federal land off the Virginia coast as a single lease for construction of offshore wind turbines. Virginia Power was awarded the lease, effective November1, 2013. The BOEM has several lease milestones with which Virginia Power must comply as conditions to being awarded the lease.
Virginia Power is also considering the development of a commercial offshore wind generation project through a federal land lease off the Virginia coast. Virginia Power and several partners are collaborating to develop a 12 MW offshore wind demonstration project, which is proposed to be located approximately 24 miles off the coast of Virginia. In May 2014, the DOE selected the Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Advancement project as one of three projects to receive up to $47 million of follow-on funding. This project may be operational as early as the end of 2018, pending regulatory approvals.
13 Table of Contents  Subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, Virginia Power plans to construct and operate Greensville County and related transmission interconnection facilities. If the project is approved, commercial operations are expected to commence in late 2018, at an estimated cost of approximately $1.3 billion, excluding financing costs.
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion The generation capacity of Dominions merchant fleet totals approximately 4,300 MW. The generation mix is diversified and includes nuclear, natural gas and renewables. Merchant non-renewable generation facilities are located in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, with a majority of that capacity concentrated in New England. Dominions merchant renewable generation facilities include a fuel cell generation facility in Connecticut, solar generation facilities in Indiana, Georgia, California, Tennessee, Utah and Connecticut, and wind generation facilities in Indiana and West Virginia. Additional solar projects under construction are as set forth below:  In June 2015, Dominion acquired 50% of the units in Four Brothers from SunEdison for $64 million of consideration. Four Brothers purpose is to develop and operate four solar projects located in Utah, which will produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The projects are expected to cost approximately $730 million to construct, including the initial acquisition cost. The facilities are expected to begin commercial operations in the third quarter of 2016, generating approximately 320 MW.
In September 2015, Dominion acquired 50% of the units in Three Cedars from SunEdison for $43 million of consideration. Three Cedars purpose is to develop and operate three solar projects located in Utah, which will produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The projects are expected to cost approximately $425 million to construct. The facilities are expected to begin commercial operations in the third quarter of 2016, generating approximately 210 MW.
In November 2015, Dominion acquired 100% of the equity interests of the Eastern Shore Solar project in Virginia from Community Energy, Inc. for $34 million. The project is expected to cost approximately $212 million once constructed, including the initial acquisition cost. The facility is expected to begin commercial operations in October 2016 and generate approximately 80 MW.
S OURCES OF E NERGY S UPPLY Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Dominion Generation uses a variety of fuels to power its electric generation and purchases power for utility system load requirements and to satisfy physical forward sale requirements, as described below. Some of these agreements have fixed commitments and are included as contractual obligations in Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures in Item7. MD&A.
Nuclear Fuel Dominion Generation primarily utilizes long-term contracts to support its nuclear fuel requirements. Worldwide market conditions are continuously evaluated to ensure a range of supply options at reasonable prices which are dependent on the market environment. Current agreements, inventories and spot market availability are expected to support current and planned fuel supply needs. Additional fuel is purchased as required to ensure optimal cost and inventory levels.
Fossil Fuel Dominion Generation primarily utilizes natural gas and coal in its fossil fuel plants. All recent fossil fuel plant construction for Dominion Generation, with the exception of the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, involves natural gas generation.
Dominion Generations natural gas and oil supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, purchases from local producers in the Appalachian area and Marcellus and Utica regions, purchases from gas marketers and withdrawals from underground storage fields owned by Dominion or third parties. Dominion Generation manages a portfolio of natural gas transportation contracts (capacity) that provides for reliable natural gas deliveries to its gas turbine fleet, while minimizing costs.
Dominion Generations coal supply is obtained through long-term contracts and short-term spot agreements from domestic suppliers.
Biomass Dominion Generations biomass supply is obtained through long-term contracts and short-term spot agreements from local suppliers.
Purchased Power Dominion Generation purchases electricity from the PJM spot market and through power purchase agreements with other suppliers to provide for utility system load requirements.
Dominion Generation also occasionally purchases electricity from the PJM and ISO-NE spot markets to satisfy physical forward sale requirements as part of its merchant generation operations.

S EASONALITY Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Sales of electricity for Dominion Generation typically vary seasonally as a result of the impact of changes in temperature and the availability of alternative sources for heating on demand by residential and commercial customers. See DVP-Seasonality above for additional considerations that also apply to Dominion Generation.
14 Table of Contents N UCLEAR D ECOMMISSIONING Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion and Virginia Power Virginia Power has a total of four licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Surry and North Anna in Virginia.
Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. Amounts collected from ratepayers are placed into trusts and are invested to fund the expected future costs of decommissioning the Surry and North Anna units.
Virginia Power believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects the long-term investment horizon, since the units will not be decommissioned for decades, and a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns. Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC.
The estimated cost to decommission Virginia Powers four nuclear units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed in 2014. These cost studies are generally completed every four to five years. The current cost estimates assume decommissioning activities will begin shortly after cessation of operations, which will occur when the operating licenses expire. Virginia Power expects to decommission the Surry and North Anna units during the period 2032 to 2078.
Dominion Generation Operating SegmentDominion In addition to the four nuclear units discussed above, Dominion has two licensed, operating nuclear reactors at Millstone in Connecticut. A third Millstone unit ceased operations before Dominion acquired the power station. In May 2013, Dominion ceased operations at its single unit Kewaunee in Wisconsin and commenced decommissioning activities using the SAFSTOR methodology. The planned decommissioning completion date is 2073, which is within the NRC allowed 60-year window.
As part of Dominions acquisition of both Millstone and Kewaunee, it acquired decommissioning funds for the related units. Any funds remaining in Kewaunees trust after decommissioning is completed are required to be refunded to Wisconsin ratepayers. Dominion believes that the amounts currently available in the decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Dominion will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirements, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. The estimated cost to decommission Dominions eight units is reflected in the table below and is primarily based upon site-specific studies completed for Surry, North Anna and Millstone in 2014 and for Kewaunee in 2013.
The estimated decommissioning costs and license expiration dates for the nuclear units owned by Dominion and Virginia Power are shown in the following table: NRC license expiration year Most recent cost estimate (2015 dollars) (1) Funds in trusts at December31, 2015 2015 contributions to trusts (dollars in millions) Surry Unit 1 2032 $ 588 $ 551 $ 0.6 Unit 2 2033 608 543 0.6 North Anna Unit 1 (2) 2038 503 439 0.4 Unit 2 (2) 2040 515 412 0.3 Total (Virginia Power) 2,214 1,945 1.9 Millstone Unit 1 (3) N/A 369 444  Unit 2 2035 552 570  Unit 3 (4) 2045 669 563  Kewaunee Unit 1 (5) N/A 494 661  Total (Dominion) $ 4,298 $ 4,183 $ 1.9 (1) The cost estimates shown above reflect reductions for the expected future recovery of certain spent fuel costs based on Dominions and Virginia Powers contracts with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel consistent with the reductions reflected in Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear decommissioning AROs.
(2) North Anna is jointly owned by Virginia Power (88.4%)and ODEC (11.6%). However, Virginia Power is responsible for 89.26% of the decommissioning obligation. Amounts reflect 89.26% of the decommissioning cost for both of North Annas units.
(3) Unit 1 permanently ceased operations in 1998, before Dominions acquisition of Millstone.
(4) Millstone Unit 3 is jointly owned by Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, with a 6.53% undivided interest in Unit 3 owned by Massachusetts Municipal and Green Mountain. Decommissioning cost is shown at Dominions ownership percentage. At December31, 2015, the minority owners held $35 million of trust funds related to Millstone Unit 3 that are not reflected in the table above.
(5) Permanently ceased operations in 2013.
Also see Note 14 and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about AROs and nuclear decommissioning, respectively, and Note 9 for information about nuclear decommissioning trust investments.
Dominion Energy The Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion Gas includes the majority of Dominions regulated natural gas operations. DTI, the gas transmission pipeline and storage business, serves gas dis tribution businesses and other customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Included in the transmission pipeline and storage business is gas gathering and processing activity, which includes the sale of extracted products at market rates. As discussed further under Properties and Investments , Dominion Gas has requested approval from FERC to transfer these gathering and processing assets from DTI to another wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Gas. East Ohio, the primary gas distribution business of Dominion, serves residential, commercial and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers. Dominion Iroquois holds a 24.72% noncontrolling partnership interest in 15 Table of Contents Iroquois, which provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges primarily in New York.
Earnings for the Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion Gas primarily result from rates established by FERC and the Ohio Commission. The profitability of this business is dependent on Dominion Gas ability, through the rates it is permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy.
Approximately 96% of the transmission capacity under contract on DTIs pipeline is subscribed with long-term contracts (two years or greater). The remaining 4% is contracted on a year-to-year basis. Less than 1% of firm transportation capacity is currently unsubscribed. Less than 1% of storage services are unsubscribed. All contracted storage is subscribed with long-term contracts.
Revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices.For DTIs processing plants, Dominion Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensation for its services.This exposes Dominion Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas.In addition, Dominion Gas has volumetric risk as customers receiving these services are not required to deliver minimum quantities of gas.
East Ohio utilizes a straight-fixed-variable rate design for a majority of its customers. Under this rate design, East Ohio recovers a large portion of its fixed operating costs through a flat monthly charge accompanied by a reduced volumetric base delivery rate. Accordingly, East Ohios revenue is less impacted by weather-related fluctuations in natural gas consumption than under the traditional rate design.
In addition to the operations of Dominion Gas, the Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion also includes LNG operations, Hopes gas distribution operations in West Virginia, and nonregulated retail natural gas marketing, as well as Dominions investments in the Blue Racer joint venture, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Dominion Midstream. See Properties and Investments below for additional information regarding the Atlantic Coast Pipeline investment. Dominions LNG operations involve the import and storage of LNG at Cove Point and the transportation of regasified LNG to the interstate pipeline grid and mid-Atlantic and Northeast markets. Dominion has received DOE and FERC approval to export LNG from Cove Point and has begun construction on a bi-directional facility, which will be able to import LNG and vaporize it as natural gas and liquefy natural gas and export it as LNG. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
In 2014, Dominion formed Dominion Midstream, an MLP initially consisting of a preferred equity interest in Cove Point. See General above for more information. Also see Acquisitions and Dispositions above and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of Dominions acquisition of DCG, which Dominion contributed to Dominion Midstream in April 2015, as well as Dominion Midstreams acquisition of an additional partnership interest in Iroquois in September 2015.
Blue Racer concentrates on building and operating new gathering, processing, fractionation and NGL transportation assets as the development of the Utica Shale formation increases. Dominion has contributed or sold various assets to the joint venture. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Dominion Energys existing five-year investment plan includes spending approximately $7.3 billion from 2016 through 2020 to upgrade existing infrastructure or add new pipelines to meet growing energy needs within its service territory and maintain reliability. Demand for natural gas is expected to continue to grow as the Clean Power Plan and other initiatives to transition to gas from more carbon-intensive fuels are implemented. This plan includes spending for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project and approximately $1.4 billion, exclusive of financing costs, for the Liquefaction Project.
In addition to the earnings drivers noted above for Dominion Gas, earnings for the Dominion Energy Operating Segment of Dominion primarily include the results of rates established by FERC and the West Virginia Commission. Additionally, Dominion Energy receives revenue from firm fee-based contractual arrangements, including negotiated rates, for certain LNG storage and regasification services. Hopes gas distribution operations in West Virginia serve residential, commercial and industrial gas sales, transportation and gathering service customers. Revenue provided by Hopes operations is based primarily on rates established by the West Virginia Commission. DCGs revenues are primarily derived from reservation charges for firm transportation services as provided for in its FERC approved tariff. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on their capital investments. Variability in earnings results from changes in operating and maintenance expenditures, as well as changes in rates and the demand for services, which are dependent on weather, changes in commodity prices and the economy. The processing and fractionation operations within Dominion Energys Blue Racer joint venture are primarily managed under long-term fee-based contracts, which minimizes direct commodity price risk. However, commodity prices do impact customer demand for Blue Racers services.
Dominions retail energy marketing operations compete in nonregulated energy markets. In March 2014, Dominion completed the sale of its electric retail energy marketing business; however, it still participates in the retail natural gas and energy-related products and services businesses. The remaining customer base includes approximately 1.3million customer accounts. Dominion has a heavy concentration of natural gas customers in markets where utilities have a long-standing commitment to customer choice, primarily in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania.
C OMPETITION Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion and Dominion Gas Dominion Gas natural gas transmission operations compete with domestic and Canadian pipeline companies. Dominion Gas also competes with gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services. Alternative energy sources, such as oil or coal, provide another level of competition. Although competition is based primarily on price, the array of services that 16 Table of Contents can be provided to customers is also an important factor. The combination of capacity rights held on certain long-line pipelines, a large storage capability and the availability of numerous receipt and delivery points along its own pipeline system enable Dominion to tailor its services to meet the needs of individual customers.
DTIs processing and fractionation operations face competition in obtaining natural gas supplies for its processing and related services. Numerous factors impact any given customers choice of processing services provider, including the location of the facilities, efficiency and reliability of operations, and the pricing arrangements offered.
In Ohio, there has been no legislation enacted to require supplier choice for natural gas distribution consumers. However, East Ohio has offered an Energy Choice program to residential and commercial customers since October 2000. East Ohio has since taken various steps approved by the Ohio Commission toward exiting the merchant function, including restructuring its commodity service and placing Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with participating suppliers. Further, in April 2013, East Ohio fully exited the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, which are now required to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December31, 2015, approximately 1 million of East Ohios 1.2 million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program.
Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion For Hope, West Virginia does not allow customers to choose their provider in its retail natural gas markets at this time. See Regulation-State Regulations-Gas for additional information.
Cove Points gas transportation, LNG import and storage operations, as well as the Liquefaction Projects capacity are contracted primarily under long-term fixed reservation fee agreements. However, in the future Cove Point may compete with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies on the basis of terminal location, services provided and price. Competition from terminal operators primarily comes from refiners and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms.
DCGs pipeline system generates a substantial portion of its revenue from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and is therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. When these long-term contracts expire, DCGs pipeline system faces competitive pressures from similar facilities that serve the South Carolina and southeastern Georgia area in terms of location, rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service.
Dominions retail energy marketing operations compete against incumbent utilities and other energy marketers in nonregulated energy markets for natural gas. Customers in these markets have the right to select a retail marketer and typically do so based upon price savings or price stability; however, incumbent utilities have the advantage of long-standing relationships with their customers and greater name recognition in their markets.
R EGULATION Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion and Dominion Gas Dominion Gas natural gas transmission, storage, processing and gathering operations are regulated primarily by FERC. East Ohios gas distribution operations, including the rates that it may charge to customers, are regulated by the Ohio Commission. See State Regulations and Federal Regulations in Regulation for more information.

P ROPERTIES AND I NVESTMENTS For a description of Dominions and Dominion Gas existing facilities see Item2. Properties .
Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion and Dominion Gas Dominion Gas has the following significant projects under construction or development to better serve customers or expand its service offerings within its service territory.
In July 2013, East Ohio signed long-term precedent agreements with two customers to move 320,000 Dths per day of processed gas from the outlet of new gas processing facilities in Ohio to interconnections with multiple interstate pipelines. The first phase of the Western Access project provides system enhancements to facilitate the movement of processed gas over East Ohios system. The initial phase of the project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and cost approximately $85 million. During the second and third quarters of 2014, East Ohio executed long-term precedent agreements with customers for 450,000 Dths per day of service to new interconnects with interstate pipelines.This second phase of the Western Access project will expand the number of interstate pipelines to which East Ohio will deliver processed gas to four. East Ohio commenced service to the Western Access II project customers in January 2016 at a cost of approximately $130 million.
In September 2014, DTI announced its intent to construct and operate the Supply Header project which is expected to cost approximately $500 million and provide 1,500,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service to various customers. In October 2014, DTI requested authorization to use FERCs pre-filing process. The application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities was filed in September 2015, with the facilities expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2018. In December 2014, DTI entered into a precedent agreement with Atlantic Coast Pipeline for the Supply Header project.
In June 2014, DTI executed binding precedent agreements with two power generators for the Leidy South project. In November 2014, one of the power generators assigned a portion of its capacity to an affiliate, bringing the total number of project customers to three. The project is expected to cost approximately 17 Table of Contents $210 million and provide 155,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Clinton County, Pennsylvania to Loudoun County, Virginia. The application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities was filed in May 2015. Service under the 20-year contracts is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2017.
During the second quarter of 2014, DTI executed a binding precedent agreement with a customer for the Monroe-to-Cornwell project. The project is expected to cost approximately $70 million and provide 205,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Monroe County, Ohio to an interconnect near Cornwell, West Virginia. In December 2015, DTI received FERC authorization to construct, operate and maintain the project facilities, which are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2016. Construction is expected to commence in March 2016.
In the first quarter of 2014, DTI executed a binding precedent agreement for the Lebanon West II project. The project is expected to cost approximately $112 million and provide 130,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Butler County, Pennsylvania to an interconnect with Texas Gas Pipeline in Lebanon, Ohio. In November 2015, DTI received FERC authorization to construct, operate and maintain the project facilities, which are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2016. Construction commenced in January 2016.
In September 2013, DTI executed binding precedent agreements with several local distribution company customers for the New Market project. The project is expected to cost approximately $159 million and provide 112,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from Leidy, Pennsylvania to interconnects with Iroquois and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporations distribution system in the Albany, New York market. In June 2014, DTI filed an application to request FERC authorization to construct, operate and maintain the project facilities, which are expected to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In October 2013, DTI executed a binding precedent agreement with CNX Gas Company LLC for the Clarington project. The project is expected to cost approximately $78 million and provide 250,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from central West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio. In August 2015, DTI received FERC authorization to construct, operate and maintain the project facilities. Construction commenced in December 2015. The project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at replacing approximately 4,100 miles of its pipeline system at a cost of $2.7 billion. In 2011, approval was obtained to include an additional 1,450 miles and to increase annual capital investment to meet the program goal. The program will replace approximately 25% of the pipeline system and is anticipated to take place over a total of 25 years.
In October 2015, DTI filed an application with FERC seeking authority to abandon by sale its gathering and processing facilities to Dominion Gathering and Processing, Inc., a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Gas. Pending approval by FERC, these gathering and processing facilities with a carrying value of approximately $430 million are expected to be transferred in 2016.
Dominion Energy Operating SegmentDominion Dominion has the following significant projects under construction or development.
Cove Point Dominion is pursuing the Liquefaction Project, which would enable Cove Point to liquefy domestically-produced natural gas for export as LNG. The DOE previously authorized Dominion to export LNG to countries with free trade agreements. In September 2013, the DOE authorized Dominion to export LNG from Cove Point to non-free trade agreement countries.
In May 2014, the FERC staff issued its EA for the Liquefaction Project. In the EA, the FERC staff addressed a variety of topics related to the proposed construction and development of the Liquefaction Project and its potential impact to the environment, and determined that with the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, the Liquefaction Project can be built and operated safely with no significant impact to the environment. In September 2014, Cove Point received the FERC order authorizing the Liquefaction Project with certain conditions. The conditions regarding the Liquefaction Project set forth in the FERC order largely incorporate the mitigation measures proposed in the EA. In October 2014, Cove Point commenced construction of the Liquefaction Project, with an in-service date anticipated in late 2017. The Cove Point facility is authorized to export at a rate of 770million cubic feet of natural gas per day for a period of 20 years.
In April 2013, Dominion announced it had fully subscribed the capacity of the project with 20-year terminal service agreements. ST Cove Point, LLC, a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese corporation that is one of the worlds leading trading companies, and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation that is the largest natural gas utility in Japan, and GAIL Global (USA) LNG LLC, a wholly-owned indirect U.S. subsidiary of GAIL (India) Ltd., have each contracted for half of the capacity. Following completion of the front-end engineering and design work, Dominion also announced it had awarded its EPC contract for new liquefaction facilities to IHI/Kiewit Cove Point, a joint venture between IHI E&C International Corporation and Kiewit Energy Company.
Cove Point has historically operated as an LNG import facility under various long-term import contracts. Since 2010, Dominion has renegotiated certain existing LNG import contracts in a manner that will result in a significant reduction in pipeline and storage capacity utilization and associated anticipated revenues during the period from 2017 through 2028. Such amendments created the opportunity for Dominion to explore the Liquefaction Project, which, assuming it becomes operational, will extend the economic life of Cove Point and contribute to Dominions overall growth plan. In total, these renegotiations reduced Cove Points expected annual revenues from the import-related contracts by approximately $150 million from 2017 through 2028, partially offset by approximately $50 million of additional revenues in the years 2013 through 2017.
In 2014, DCG executed binding precedent agreements with three customers for the Transco-to-Charleston project. The project is expected to cost approximately $120 million, and provide 80,000 Dths per day of firm transportation service from an existing interconnect with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC in Spartanburg County, South Carolina to customers in Dillon, Marlboro, Sumter, Charleston, Lexington and Richland 18 Table of Contents counties, South Carolina.In July 2015, DCG requested authorization to utilize FERCs pre-filing process.DCG expects to file the application to request FERC authorization to construct and operate the project facilities in the first quarter of 2016. The project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Dominion Energy Equity Method Investments In September 2015, Dominion, through Dominion Midstream, acquired an additional 25.93% interest in Iroquois.Dominion Gas holds a 24.72% interest with TransCanada holding a 44.48% interest and TEN Transmission Company holding a 4.87% interest. Iroquois owns and operates a 416-mile FERC regulated interstate natural gas pipeline providing service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges.Iroquois pipeline extends from the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, New York through the state of Connecticut to South Commack, Long Island, New York and continuing on from Northport, Long Island, New York through the Long Island Sound to Hunts Point, Bronx, New York.See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominions equity method investment in Iroquois.
In September 2014, Dominion, along with Duke Energy, Piedmont and AGL, announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The members, which are subsidiaries of the above-referenced parent companies, hold the following membership interests: Dominion, 45%; Duke Energy, 40%; Piedmont, 10%; and AGL, 5%. In October2015, Duke Energy entered into a merger agreement with Piedmont. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline partnership agreement includes provisions to allow Dominion an option to purchase additional ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline to maintain a leading ownership percentage. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, which has a total expected cost of $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion, excluding financing costs. In October 2014, Atlantic Coast Pipeline requested approval from FERC to utilize the pre-filing process under which environmental review for the natural gas pipeline project will commence. It filed its FERC application in September 2015 and expects to be in service in late 2018. The project is subject to FERC, state and other federal approvals. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominions equity method investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
In December 2012, Dominion formed Blue Racer with Caiman to provide midstream services to natural gas producers operating in the Utica Shale region in Ohio and portions of Pennsylvania. Blue Racer is an equal partnership between Dominion and Caiman, with Dominion contributing midstream assets and Caiman contributing private equity capital. Midstream services offered by Blue Racer include gathering, processing, fractionation, and natural gas liquids transportation and marketing. Blue Racer is expected to leverage Dominions existing presence in the Utica region with significant additional new capacity designed to meet producer needs as the development of the Utica Shale formation increases. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Dominions equity method investment in Blue Racer.
S OURCES OF E NERGY S UPPLY Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas supply is obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, local producers in the Appalachian area and gas marketers. Dominions and Dominion Gas large underground natural gas storage network and the location of their pipeline systems are a significant link between the countrys major interstate gas pipelines and large markets in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. Dominions and Dominion Gas pipelines are part of an interconnected gas transmission system, which provides access to supplies nationwide for local distribution companies, marketers, power generators and industrial and commercial customers.
Dominions and Dominion Gas underground storage facilities play an important part in balancing gas supply with consumer demand and are essential to serving the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. In addition, storage capacity is an important element in the effective management of both gas supply and pipeline transmission capacity.
The supply of gas to serve Dominions retail energy marketing customers is procured through market wholesalers or by Dominion Energy.
S EASONALITY Dominion Energys natural gas distribution business earnings vary seasonally, as a result of the impact of changes in temperature on demand by residential and commercial customers for gas to meet heating needs. Historically, the majority of these earnings have been generated during the heating season, which is generally from November to March; however, implementation of the straight-fixed-variable rate design at East Ohio has reduced the earnings impact of weather-related fluctuations. Demand for services at Dominions pipeline and storage business can also be weather sensitive. Earnings are also impacted by changes in commodity prices driven by seasonal weather changes, the effects of unusual weather events on operations and the economy.
The earnings of Dominions retail energy marketing operations also vary seasonally. Generally, the demand for gas peaks during the winter months to meet heating needs.
Corporate and Other Corporate and Other SegmentVirginia Power and Dominion Gas Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas Corporate and Other segments primarily include certain specific items attributable to their operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or allocating resources among the segments.
Corporate and Other SegmentDominion Dominions Corporate and Other segment includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) and the net impact of operations that are discontinued, which is discussed in Note 3 and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominions operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or allocating resources among the segments.
19 Table of Contents R EGULATION The Companies are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including the Virginia Commission, North Carolina Commission, Ohio Commission, West Virginia Commission, Maryland Commission, SEC, FERC, EPA, DOE, NRC, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Transportation.
State Regulations E LECTRIC Virginia Powers electric utility retail service is subject to regulation by the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission.
Virginia Power holds CPCNs which authorize it to maintain and operate its electric facilities now in operation and to sell electricity to customers. However, Virginia Power may not construct generating facilities or large capacity transmission lines without the prior approval of various state and federal government agencies. In addition, the Virginia Commission and the North Carolina Commission regulate Virginia Powers transactions with affiliates, transfers of certain facilities and the issuance of certain securities.
Electric Regulation in Virginia The Regulation Act enacted in 2007 instituted a cost-of-service rate model, ending Virginias planned transition to retail competition for electric supply service to most classes of customers.
The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved transmission costs, underground distribution lines, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission. As amended, it provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific newly-proposed generation projects.
If the Virginia Commissions future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Powers rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Powers expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Regulation Act Legislation In February 2015, the Virginia Governor signed legislation into law which will keep Virginia Powers base rates unchanged until at least December 1, 2022. In addition, no biennial reviews will be conducted by the Virginia Commission for the five successive 12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2015, and ending December 31, 2019. The legislation states that Virginia Powers 2015 biennial review, filed in March 2015, would proceed for the sole purpose of reviewing and determining whether any refunds are due to customers based on earnings performance for generation and distribution services during the 2013 and 2014 test periods. In addition the legislation requires the Virginia Commission to conduct proceedings in 2017 and 2019 to determine the utilitys ROE for use in connection with rate adjustment clauses and requires utilities to file integrated resource plans annually rather than biennially. However, in November 2015, the Virginia Commission ordered testimony, briefs and separate bifurcated hearing in Virginia Powers currently pending Rider B, Rider R, Rider S and Rider W cases on whether the Virginia Commission can adjust the ROE applicable to these rate adjustment clauses prior to 2017. The legislation also required Virginia Power to write-off $85 million of prior-period deferred fuel costs during the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the legislation required the Virginia Commission to implement a fuel rate reduction for Virginia Power as soon as practicable based on this non-recovery as well as any over-recovery for the 2014-2015 fuel year and projected fuel expense for the 2015-2016 fuel year. The legislation also deems the construction or purchase of one or more utility-scale solar facilities located in Virginia up to 500 MW in total to be in the public interest.
2015 Biennial Review Pursuant to the Regulation Act, in March 2015, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and schedules for the Virginia Commissions 2015 biennial review of Virginia Powers rates, terms and conditions. Per legislation enacted in February 2015, this biennial review was limited to reviewing Virginia Powers earnings on rates for generation and distribution services for the combined 2013 and 2014 test period, and determining whether credits are due to customers in the event Virginia Powers earnings exceeded the earnings band determined in the 2013 Biennial Review Order. In November 2015, the Virginia Commission issued the 2015 Biennial Review Order.
After deciding several contested regulatory earnings adjustments, the Virginia Commission ruled that Virginia Power earned on average an ROE of approximately 10.89% on its generation and distribution services for the combined 2013 and 2014 test periods. Because this ROE was more than 70 basis points above Virginia Powers authorized ROE of 10.0%, the Virginia Commission ordered that approximately $20 million in excess earnings be credited to customer bills based on usage in 2013 and 2014 over a six-month period beginning within 60 days of the 2015 Biennial Review Order. Based upon 2015 legislation keeping Virginia Powers base rates unchanged until at least December 1, 2022, the Virginia Commission did not order certain existing rate adjustment clauses to be combined with Virginia Powers base rates. The Virginia Commission did not determine whether Virginia Power had a revenue deficiency or sufficiency when projecting the annual revenues generated by base rates to the revenues required to recover costs of service and earn a fair return. In December 2015, a group of large industrial customers filed notices of appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia from both the 2015 Biennial Review Order and the Virginia Commissions order denying their petition for rehearing or reconsideration. This appeal is pending.
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Electric Regulation in North Carolina Virginia Powers retail electric base rates in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutesand the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. North Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows Virginia Power to recover its operating costs and an ROIC.If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric 20 Table of Contents rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel rates are subject to revision under annual fuel cost adjustment proceedings.
Virginia Powers transmission service rates in North Carolina are regulated by the North Carolina Commission as part of Virginia Powers bundled retail service to North Carolina customers. In March 2012, Virginia Power filed an application with the North Carolina Commission to increase base non-fuel revenues with January1, 2013 as the proposed effective date for the permanent rate revision. In December 2012, the North Carolina Commission approved a $36 million increase in Virginia Powers annual non-fuel base revenues based on an authorized ROE of 10.2%, and a $14 million decrease in annual base fuel revenues for a combined total base revenue increase of $22 million. These rate changes became effective on January1, 2013. Following an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, the North Carolina Commission issued an opinion reaffirming its 10.2% ROE determination in July 2015.
In August 2015, Virginia Power submitted its annual filing to the North Carolina Commission to adjust the fuel component of its electric rates. Virginia Power proposed an $11 million decrease to the fuel component of its electric rates for the rate year beginning January1, 2016. This decrease includes the North Carolina Commissions previous approval to defer recovering 50% of Virginia Powers estimated $17 million jurisdictional deferred fuel balance to the 2016 fuel year, without interest. In December 2015, the North Carolina Commission approved Virginia Powers proposed fuel charge adjustment.
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
G AS East Ohios natural gas distribution services, including the rates it may charge its customers, are regulated by the Ohio Commission. Hopes natural gas distribution services are regulated by the West Virginia Commission.
Gas Regulation in Ohio East Ohio is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the Ohio Commission. When necessary, East Ohio seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost of service by rate class. A straight-fixed-variable rate design, in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through a monthly charge rather than a volumetric charge, is utilized to establish rates for a majority of East Ohios customers pursuant to a 2008 rate case settlement which included an authorized ROE of 10.38%.
In addition to general base rate increases, East Ohio makes routine filings with the Ohio Commission to reflect changes in the costs of gas purchased for operational balancing on its system. These purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The rider filings cover unrecovered gas costs plus prospective annual demand costs. Increases or decreases in gas cost rider rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses.
The Ohio Commission has also approved several stand-alone cost recovery mechanisms to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure projects and certain other costs that vary widely over time; such costs are excluded from general base rates. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Gas Regulation in West Virginia Dominions gas distribution subsidiary is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its business by the West Virginia Commission. When necessary, Hope seeks general base rate increases to recover increased operating costs and a fair return on rate base investments. Base rates are set based on the cost of service by rate class. Base rates for Hope are designed primarily based on rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges.
In addition to general rate increases, Hope makes routine separate filings with the West Virginia Commission to reflect changes in the costs of purchased gas. The majority of these purchased gas costs are subject to rate recovery through a mechanism that ensures dollar for dollar recovery of prudently incurred costs. Costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates are deferred as regulatory assets. The purchased gas cost recovery filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Approved increases or decreases in gas cost recovery rates result in increases or decreases in revenues with corresponding increases or decreases in net purchased gas cost expenses.
Legislation was passed in West Virginia authorizing a stand-alone cost recovery mechanism to recover specified costs and a return for infrastructure upgrades, replacements and expansions between general base rate cases.
Status of Competitive Retail Gas Services Both of the states in which Dominion and Dominion Gas have gas distribution operations have considered legislation regarding a competitive deregulation of natural gas sales at the retail level.
Ohio Since October 2000, East Ohio has offered the Energy Choice program, under which residential and commercial customers are encouraged to purchase gas directly from retail suppliers or through a community aggregation program. In October 2006, East Ohio restructured its commodity service by entering into gas purchase contracts with selected suppliers at a fixed price above the New York Mercantile Exchange month-end settlement and passing that gas cost to customers under the Standard Service Offer program. Starting in April 2009, East Ohio buys natural gas under the Standard Service Offer program only for customers not eligible to participate in the Energy Choice program and places Energy Choice-eligible customers in a direct retail relationship with selected suppliers, which is designated on the customers bills.
In January 2013, the Ohio Commission granted East Ohios motion to fully exit the merchant function for its nonresidential customers, beginning in April 2013, which requires those customers to choose a retail supplier or be assigned to one at a monthly variable rate set by the supplier. At December31, 2015, 21 Table of Contents approximately 1.0million of Dominion Gas 1.2million Ohio customers were participating in the Energy Choice program. Subject to the Ohio Commissions approval, East Ohio may eventually exit the gas merchant function in Ohio entirely and have all customers select an alternate gas supplier. East Ohio continues to be the provider of last resort in the event of default by a supplier. Large industrial customers in Ohio also source their own natural gas supplies.
West Virginia At this time, West Virginia has not enacted legislation allowing customers to choose providers in the retail natural gas markets served by Hope. However, the West Virginia Commission has issued regulations to govern pooling services, one of the tools that natural gas suppliers may utilize to provide retail customers a choice in the future and has issued rules requiring competitive gas service providers to be licensed in West Virginia.
Federal Regulations F EDERAL E NERGY R EGULATORY C OMMISSION Electric Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Virginia Power purchases and sells electricity in the PJM wholesale market and Dominions merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO, CAISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the states of Tennessee, Georgia, California and Utah, under Dominions market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Powers service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.
Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to FERCs Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees of interstate gas and electricity transmission providers and the marketing function employees of their affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to prevent transmission providers from giving their affiliates undue preferences.
Dominion and Virginia Power are also subject to FERCs affiliate restrictions that (1)prohibit power sales between Virginia Power and Dominions merchant plants without first receiving FERC authorization, (2)require the merchant plants and Virginia Power to conduct their wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3)prohibit Virginia Power from sharing market information with merchant plant operating personnel. The rules are designed to prohibit Virginia Power from giving the merchant plants a competitive advantage.
EPACT included provisions to create an ERO. The ERO is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the ERO and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards will be subject to fines of up to $1 million per day, per violation and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation.
Dominion and Virginia Power plan and operate their facilities in compliance with approved NERC reliability requirements. Dominion and Virginia Power employees participate on various NERC committees, track the development and implementation of standards, and maintain proper compliance registration with NERCs regional organizations. Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate incurring additional compliance expenditures over the next several years as a result of the implementation of new cybersecurity programs as well as efforts to ensure appropriate facility ratings for Virginia Powers transmission lines. In October 2010, NERC issued an industry alert identifying possible discrepancies between the design and actual field conditions of transmission facilities as a potential reliability issue. The alert recommends that entities review their current facilities rating methodology to verify that the methodology is based on actual field conditions, rather than solely on design documents, and to take corrective action if necessary. Virginia Power has evaluated its transmission facilities for any discrepancies between design and actual field conditions and has taken necessary corrective actions. In addition, NERC has redefined critical assets which expanded the number of assets subject to NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity assets. While Dominion and Virginia Power expect to incur additional compliance costs in connection with the above NERC requirements and initiatives, such expenses are not expected to significantly affect results of operations.
In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Powers electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.
Gas FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over rates, terms and conditions of services performed by DTI, DCG, Iroquois and certain services performed by Cove Point. Pursuant to FERCs February 2014 approval of DTIs uncontested settlement offer, DTIs base rates for storage and transportation services are subject to a moratorium through the end of 2016. The design, construction and operation of Cove Points LNG facility, including associated natural gas pipelines, the Liquefaction Project and the import and export of LNG are also regulated by FERC.
Dominion Gas interstate gas transmission and storage activities are conducted on an open access basis, in accordance with certificates, tariffs and service agreements on file with FERC and FERC regulations.
Dominion Gas operates in compliance with FERC standards of conduct, which prohibit the sharing of certain non-public transmission information or customer specific data by its interstate gas transmission and storage companies with non-transmission function employees. Pursuant to these standards of conduct, Dominion Gas also makes certain informational postings available on Dominions website.
22 Table of Contents See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Safety Regulations Dominion Gas is also subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which mandate inspections of interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission and storage pipelines, particularly those located in areas of high-density population. Dominion Gas has evaluated its natural gas transmission and storage properties, as required by the Department of Transportation regulations under these Acts, and has implemented a program of identification, testing and potential remediation activities. These activities are ongoing.
The Companies are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The Companies have an internal safety, health and security program designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements, which is routinely reviewed and considered for improvement. The Companies believe that they are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to worker health and safety. Nothwithstanding these preventive measures, incidents may occur that are outside of the Companies control.
Environmental Regulations Each of the Companies operating segments faces substantial laws, regulations and compliance costs with respect to environmental matters. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the Companies. There are significant new regulations affecting Dominions electric generation and gas businesses in the Clean Power Plan and NSPS regulating methane and VOC emissions, respectively. If expenditures for GHG emissions reductions and pollution control technologies and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates (in regulated businesses) or market prices (in unregulated businesses), those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows. The Companies have applied for or obtained the necessary environmental permits for the operation of their facilities. Many of these permits are subject to reissuance and continuing review. For a discussion of significant aspects of these matters, including current and planned capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance required to be discussed in this Item, see Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item7. MD&A, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Additional information can also be found in Item3. Legal Proceedings and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
G LOBAL C LIMATE C HANGE The national and international attention in recent years on GHG emissions and their relationship to climate change has resulted in federal, regional and state legislative and regulatory action in this area. See, for example, the discussion of the Clean Power Plan and the United Nations Paris Agreement in Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item 7. MD&A. The Companies support national climate change legislation that would provide a consistent, economy-wide approach to addressing this issue and are currently taking action to protect the environment and address climate change while meeting the growing needs of their service territory. The Companies are actively developing plans to comply with new Clean Power Plan and NSPS regulations for new and existing electric generating sources and its natural gas business. Dominions CEO and operating segment CEOs are responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including climate change, and Dominions Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these matters. See Environmental Strategy below , Environmental Matters in Future Issues and Other Matters in Item7. MD&A and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on climate change legislation and regulation, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
W ATER The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. Dominion must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at its operating facilities.
T HREATENED A ND E NDANGERED S PECIES The Endangered Species Act establishes prohibitions on activities that can result in harm of specific species of plants and animals. In some cases those prohibitions could result in impacts to the viability of projects or requirements for capital expenditures to reduce a facilitys impacts on a species.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission All aspects of the operation and maintenance of Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear power stations are regulated by the NRC. Operating licenses issued by the NRC are subject to revocation, suspension or modification, and the operation of a nuclear unit may be suspended if the NRC determines that the public interest, health or safety so requires.
From time to time, the NRC adopts new requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. In many cases, these new regulations require changes in the design, operation and maintenance of existing nuclear facilities. If the NRC adopts such requirements in the future, it could result in substantial increases in the cost of operating and maintaining Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear generating units. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The NRC also requires Dominion and Virginia Power to decontaminate their nuclear facilities once operations cease. This process is referred to as decommissioning, and Dominion and Virginia Power are required by the NRC to be financially prepared. For information on decommissioning trusts, see Dominion Generation-Nuclear Decommissioning above and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on spent nuclear fuel.
23 Table of Contents E NVIRONMENTAL S TRATEGY Environmental stewardship is embedded in the Companies culture and core values and is the responsibility of all employees. They are committed to working with their stakeholders to find sustainable solutions to the energy and environmental challenges that confront our company and our nation. It is the Companies belief that sustainable solutions must balance the interdependent goals of environmental stewardship and economic prosperity. Their integrated strategy to meet this objective consists of four major elements:  Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules;  Conservation and load management;  Renewable generation development; and  Improvements in other energy infrastructure, including natural gas operations.
This strategy incorporates the Companies efforts to voluntarily reduce GHG emissions, which are described below. See Dominion Generation-Properties and Dominion Energy-Properties for more information on certain of the projects described below.
Environmental Compliance The Companies remain committed to compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules related to their operations. As part of their commitment to compliance with such laws, Dominion and Virginia Power have sold or closed a number of coal-fired generation units over the past several years, and have plans to close additional units in the future. A significant recent development in environmental regulation was the EPAs issuance in August 2015 of final carbon standards for existing fossil fuel power plants known as the Clean Power Plan, which involves coordination with the states on specific plans to reduce carbon emissions to specified levels. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of litigation challenging the regulations. Additional information related to these and other of the Companies environmental compliance matters can be found in Operating Segments and Future Issues and Other Matters in Item7. MD&A and in Notes 3, 6 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Conservation and Load Management Conservation and load management play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for electricity. The Regulation Act provides incentives for energy conservation through the implementation of conservation programs. Additional legislation in 2009 added definitions of peak-shaving and energy efficiency programs, and allowed for a margin on operating expenses and recovery of revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs.
Virginia Powers DSM programs, implemented with Virginia Commission approval, provide important incremental steps in assisting customers to reduce energy consumption through programs that include energy audits and incentives for customers to upgrade or install certain energy efficient measures and/or systems. The DSM programs began in Virginia in 2010 and in North Carolina in 2011. Currently, there are residential and non-residential DSM programs active in the two states. Virginia Power continues to evaluate opportunities to redesign current DSM programs and develop new DSM initiatives in Virginia and North Carolina.
In Ohio, East Ohio offers three DSM programs, approved by the Ohio Commission, designed to help customers reduce their energy consumption.
Virginia Power continues to upgrade meters to AMI, also referred to as smart meters, in areas throughout Virginia. The AMI meter upgrades are part of an ongoing project that will help Virginia Power further evaluate the effectiveness of AMI meters in monitoring voltage stability, remotely turning off and on electric service, power outage and restoration detection and reporting, remote daily meter readings and offering dynamic rates.
Renewable Generation Renewable energy is also an important component of a diverse and reliable energy mix. Both Virginia and North Carolina have passed legislation setting targets for renewable power. Virginia Power is committed to meeting Virginias goals of 12% of base year electric energy sales from renewable power sources by 2022, and 15% by 2025, and North Carolinas Renewable Portfolio Standard of 12.5% by 2021 and plans to add utility solar capacity in Virginia.
See Operating Segments and Item2. Properties for additional information, including Dominions merchant solar properties.
Improvements in Other Energy Infrastructure Virginia Powers existing five-year investment plan includes significant capital expenditures to upgrade or add new electric transmission and distribution lines, substations and other facilities to meet growing electricity demand within its service territory, maintain reliability and address environmental requirements. These enhancements are primarily aimed at meeting Virginia Powers continued goal of providing reliable service, and are intended to address both continued population growth and increases in electricity consumption by the typical consumer. An additional benefit will be added capacity to efficiently deliver electricity from the renewable projects now being developed or to be developed in the future. See Properties in Item1., Operating Segments, DVP for additional information.
Dominion and Dominion Gas, in connection with their existing five-year investment plans, are also pursuing the construction or upgrade of regulated infrastructure in their natural gas businesses. See Properties and Investments in Item1., Operating Segments, Dominion Energy for additional information, including natural gas infrastructure projects.
The Companies Strategy for Voluntarily Reducing GHG Emissions The Companies have not established a standalone GHG emissions reduction target or timetable, but they are actively engaged in voluntary reduction efforts. The Companies have an integrated voluntary strategy for reducing GHG emission intensity with diversification as its cornerstone. The six principal components of the strategy include initiatives that address electric energy management, electric energy production, electric energy delivery and natural gas storage, transmission and delivery, as follows:  Enhance conservation and energy efficiency programs to help customers use energy wisely and reduce environmental impacts;  Expand the Companies renewable energy portfolio, principally wind power, solar, fuel cells and biomass, to help diversify the Companies fleet, meet state renewable energy targets and lower the carbon footprint; 24 Table of Contents  Evaluate other new generating capacity, including low emissions natural-gas fired and emissions-free nuclear units to meet customers future electricity needs;  Construct new electric transmission infrastructure to modernize the grid, promote economic security and help deliver more green energy to population centers where it is needed most;  Construct new natural gas infrastructure to expand availability of this cleaner fuel, to reduce emissions, and to promote energy and economic security both in the U.S. and abroad; and  Implement and enhance voluntary methane mitigation measures through the EPAs Natural Gas Star Program.
Since 2000, Dominion and Virginia Power have tracked the emissions of their electric generation fleet, which employs a mix of fuel and renewable energy sources. Comparing annual year 2000 to annual year 2014, the entire electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO 2 emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 39%. Comparing annual year 2000 to annual year 2014, the regulated electric generating fleet (based on ownership percentage) reduced its average CO 2 emissions rate per MWh of energy produced from electric generation by approximately 20%. Dominion and Virginia Power do not yet have final 2015 emissions data.
Dominion also developed a comprehensive GHG inventory for calendar year 2014. For Dominion Generation, Dominions and Virginia Powers direct CO 2 equivalent emissions, based on equity share (ownership), were 33.6million metric tons and 30.1million metric tons, respectively, in 2014, compared to 33.9million metric tons and 30.2million metric tons, respectively, in 2013. For the DVP operating segments electric transmission and distribution operations, direct CO 2 equivalent emissions for 2014 were 75,671 metric tons, compared to 46,446 metric tons in 2013. The increase was due to new containing equipment purchased and installed to handle growth in the electric transmission and distribution system. Although emissions from the equipment increased, the leak rate has remained relatively consistent at 1.1%. For 2014, DTIs and Cove Points direct CO 2 equivalent emissions together were 1.3million metric tons, and Hopes and East Ohios direct CO 2 equivalent emissions together were 0.9million metric tons, similar to 2013. Dominions GHG inventory follows all methodologies specified in the EPA Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 CFR Part 98 for calculating emissions.
C YBERSECURITY In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, the Companies have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. In addition, the Companies are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements, interface regularly with a wide range of external organizations, and participate in classified briefings to maintain an awareness of current cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. The Companies current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts are intended to address the evolving and changing cyber threats. See Item1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
Item1A. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. A number of these factors have been identified below. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see Forward-Looking Statements in Item7. MD&A.
The Companies results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather.
Fluctuations in weather can affect demand for the Companies services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas trans mission and distribution services. In addition, severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can disrupt operation of the Companies facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. Changes in weather conditions can result in reduced water levels or changes in water temperatures that could adversely affect operations at some of the Companies power stations. Furthermore, the Companies operations could be adversely affected and their physical plant placed at greater risk of damage should changes in global climate produce, among other possible conditions, unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, abnormal levels of precipitation and, for operations located on or near coastlines, a change in sea level or sea temperatures.
The rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and distribution operations and Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations are subject to regulatory review.
Revenue provided by Virginia Powers electric transmission, distribution and generation operations and Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission and distribution operations is based primarily on rates approved by state and federal regulatory agencies. The profitability of these businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment.
Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission service are updated on an annual basis through operation of a FERC-approved formula rate mechanism. Through this mechanism, Virginia Powers wholesale rates for electric transmission reflect the estimated cost of service for each calendar year. The difference in the estimated cost of service and actual cost of service for each calendar year is included as an adjustment to the wholesale rates for electric transmission service in a subsequent calendar year. These wholesale rates are subject to FERC review and prospective adjustment in the event that customers and/or interested state commissions file a complaint with FERC and are able to demonstrate that Virginia Powers wholesale revenue requirement is no longer just and reasonable. They are also subject to retroactive corrections to the extent that the formula rate was not properly populated with the actual costs.
Similarly, various rates and charges assessed by Dominions and Dominion Gas gas transmission businesses are subject to review by FERC. Pursuant to FERCs February 2014 approval of DTIs uncontested settlement offer, DTIs base rates for storage and transportation services are subject to a moratorium through 25 Table of Contents the end of 2016. In addition, the rates of Dominions and Dominion Gas gas distribution businesses are subject to state regulatory review in the jurisdictions in which they operate. A failure by us to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Virginia Powers base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services to customers in Virginia are reviewed by the Virginia Commission on a biennial basis in a proceeding that involves the determination of Virginia Powers actual earned ROE during a combined two-year historic test period, and the determination of Virginia Powers authorized ROE prospectively. Under certain circumstances described in the Regulation Act, Virginia Power may be required to share a portion of its earnings with customers through a refund process.
Legislation signed by the Virginia Governor in February 2015 suspends biennial reviews for the five successive 12-month test periods beginning January1, 2015 and ending December31, 2019, and no changes will be made to Virginia Powers existing base rates until at least December1, 2022. During this period, Virginia Power bears the risk of any severe weather events and natural disasters, the risk of asset impairments related to the early retirement of any generation facilities due to the implementation of the Clean Power Plan regulations, as well as an increase in general operating and financing costs, and Virginia Power may not recover its associated costs through increases to base rates. If Virginia Power incurs any such significant additional expenses during this period, Virginia Power may not be able to recover its costs and/or earn a reasonable return on capital investment, which could negatively affect Virginia Powers future earnings.
Virginia Powers retail electric base rates for bundled generation, transmission, and distribution services to customers in North Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to North Carolina statutes, and the rules and procedures of the North Carolina Commission. If retail electric earnings exceed the returns established by the North Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the North Carolina Commission, which may decrease Virginia Powers future earnings. Additionally, if the North Carolina Commission does not allow recovery through base rates, on a timely basis, of costs incurred in providing service, Virginia Powers future earnings could be negatively impacted.
Governmental officials, stakeholders and advocacy groups may challenge these regulatory reviews. Such challenges may lengthen the time, complexity and costs associated with such regulatory reviews.
The Companies are subject to complex governmental regulation, including tax regulation, that could adversely affect their results of operations and subject the Companies to monetary penalties.
The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation and require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies. Such laws and regulations govern the terms and conditions of the services we offer, our relationships with affiliates, protection of our critical electric infrastructure assets and pipeline safety, among other matters. These operations are also subject to legislation governing taxation at the federal, state and local level. They must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations. Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws. The Companies businesses are subject to regulatory regimes which could result in substantial monetary penalties if any of the Companies is found not to be in compliance, including mandatory reliability standards and interaction in the wholesale markets. New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, or penalties imposed for non-compliance with existing laws or regulations may result in substantial additional expense.
Dominions and Virginia Powers generation business may be negatively affected by possible FERC actions that could change market design in the wholesale markets or affect pricing rules or revenue calculations in the RTO markets.
Dominions and Virginia Powers generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC. The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk. Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERCs continuation of clearly identified market rules. From time to time FERC may investigate and authorize RTOs to make changes in market design. FERC also periodically reviews Dominions authority to sell at market-based rates. Material changes by FERC to the design of the wholesale markets or its interpretation of market rules, Dominions or Virginia Powers authority to sell power at market-based rates, or changes to pricing rules or rules involving revenue calculations, could adversely impact the future results of Dominions or Virginia Powers generation business. For example, in July 2015, FERC approved changes to PJMs Reliability Pricing Model capacity market establishing a new Capacity Performance Resource product. This product offers the potential for higher capacity prices but can also impose significant economic penalties on generator owners such as Virginia Power for failure to perform during periods when electricity is in high demand. In addition, there have been changes to the interpretation and application of FERCs market manipulation rules.A failure to comply with these rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties.
The Companies infrastructure build and expansion plans often require regulatory approval before construction can commence. The Companies may not complete facility construction, pipeline, conversion or other infrastructure projects that they commence, or they may complete projects on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated, and they may not be able to achieve the intended benefits of any such project, if completed.
Several facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects have been announced and additional projects may be considered in the future. The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages. Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies, and such approvals could include mitigation costs which may be material to the Companies. Projects may not be able to be completed on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties, difficulties with part ners or 26 Table of Contents potential partners, a decline in the credit strength of counterparties or vendors, or other factors beyond the Companies control. Even if facility construction, pipeline, expansion, electric transmission line, conversion and other infrastructure projects are completed, the total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion of the projects may not meet expectations. Start-up and operational issues can arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations at our facilities, including but not limited to commencement of commercial operations at our power generation facilities following expansions and fuel type conversions to natural gas and biomass.Such issues may include failure to meet specific operating parameters, which may require adjustments to meet or amend these operating parameters. Additionally, the Companies may not be able to timely and effec tively integrate the projects into their operations and such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs. Further, regulators may disallow recovery of some of the costs of a project if they are deemed not to be prudently incurred. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect the Companies ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the facility construction, pipeline, electric transmission line, expansion, conversion and other infrastructure projects.
The development and construction of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk.
The Companies are currently simultaneously developing or constructing several major projects, including the Liquefaction Project, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, the Supply Header project, Greensville County, Brunswick County, and multiple DTI producer outlet projects, which together help contribute to the over $23 billion in capital expenditures planned by the Companies through 2020. Several of the Companies key projects are increasingly large-scale, complex and being constructed in constrained geographic areas (for example, the Liquefaction Project) or in difficult terrain (for example, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project). The advancement of the Companies ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects. For example, certain landowners and stakeholder groups oppose the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which could impede the acquisition of rights-of-way and other land rights on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. Given that these projects provide the foundation for the Companies strategic growth plan, if the Companies are unable to obtain or maintain the required approvals, develop the necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources, adhere to budgets and timelines, effectively handle public outreach efforts, or otherwise fail to successfully execute the projects, there could be an adverse impact to the Companies financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, while Dominion has received the required approvals to commence construction of the Liquefaction Project from the DOE, all DOE export licenses are subject to review and possible withdrawal should the DOE conclude that such export authorization is no longer in the public interest. Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies ability to execute its business plan.
The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of large-scale infrastructure projects. The construction of such projects is expected to take several years, is typically confined within a limited geographic area or difficult terrain and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could cause the total cost of the project to exceed the anticipated amount and adversely affect the Companies financial performance and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the project as scheduled.
Further, an inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies financial condition, cash flows, the projects anticipated financial results and/or impair the Companies ability to execute the business plan for the projects as scheduled.
Any additional federal and/or state requirements imposed on energy companies mandating limitations on GHG emissions or requiring efficiency improvements may result in compliance costs that alone or in combination could make some of the Companies electric generation units or natural gas facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate.
The Clean Power Plan is targeted at reducing CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power generation facilities.
Compliance with the Clean Power Plan may require increasing the energy efficiency of equipment at facilities, committing significant capital toward carbon reduction programs, purchase of allowances and/or emission rate credits, fuel switching, and/or retirement of high-emitting generation facilities and potential replacement with lower emitting generation facilities. The Clean Power Plan uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units, and expanding renewable resources. Compliance with the Clean Power Plans anticipated implementing regulations may require Virginia Power to prematurely retire certain generating facilities, with the potential lack or delay of cost recovery and higher electric rates, which could affect consumer demand. The cost of compliance with the Clean Power Plan is subject to significant uncertainties due to the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables, including timing of the implementation of rules, required levels of reductions, allocation requirements of the new rules, the maturation and commercialization of carbon controls and/or reduction programs, and the selected compliance alternatives. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the aggregate effect of such requirements on their results of operations, financial condition or their customers. However, such expenditures, if material, could make Dominions and Virginia Powers generation facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect Dominions or Virginia Powers results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.
There are also potential impacts on Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas businesses as federal or state GHG regulations may require GHG emission reductions from the natural gas sector and could affect demand for natural gas. Additionally, GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact the natural gas businesses.
27 Table of Contents The Companies operations are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which impose significant compliance costs to the Companies.
The Companies operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements requires the Companies to commit significant capital toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of environmental control equipment and purchase of allowances and/or offsets. Additionally, the Companies could be responsible for expenses relating to remediation and containment obligations, including at sites where they have been identified by a regulatory agency as a potentially responsible party. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance have been significant in the past, and the Companies expect that they will remain significant in the future. Certain facilities have become uneconomical to operate and have been shut down, converted to new fuel types or sold. These types of events could occur again in the future.
Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted or become applicable to the Companies. Risks relating to expected regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are discussed above. In addition, further regulation of air quality and GHG emissions under the CAA will be imposed on the natural gas sector, including rules to limit methane leakage. The Companies are also subject to recently finalized federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations and the potential further regulation of polychlorinated biphenyls.
Compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty due to the inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rules or regulations. Other factors which affect the ability to predict future environmental expenditures with certainty include the difficulty in estimating clean-up costs and quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all responsible parties. However, such expenditures, if material, could make the Companies facilities uneconomical to operate, result in the impairment of assets, or otherwise adversely affect the Companies results of operations, financial performance or liquidity.
Virginia Power is subject to risks associated with the disposal and storage of coal ash.
Virginia Power historically produced and continues to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of its coal-fired generation operations. The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at eight different facilities.
Virginia Power may face litigation regarding alleged CWA violations at Possum Point, and is facing litigation regarding alleged CWA violations at Chesapeake and could incur settlement expenses and other costs, depending on the outcome of any such litigation, including costs associated with closing, corrective action and ongoing monitoring of certain ash ponds. In addition, the EPA and Virginia recently issued regulations concerning the management and storage of CCRs and West Virginia may impose additional regulations that will apply to the facilities noted above. These regulations will require Virginia Power to make additional capital expenditures and increase its operating and maintenance expenses.
Further, while Virginia Power operates its ash ponds and landfills in compliance with applicable state safety regulations, a release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact, such as the Dan River ash basin release by a neighboring utility, could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage, and could impact the financial condition of Virginia Power.
The Companies operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues which could negatively affect the Companies.
Operation of the Companies facilities involves risk, including the risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, pipeline integrity or transportation disruptions, accidents, labor disputes or work stoppages by employees, acts of terrorism or sabotage, construction delays or cost overruns, shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material and labor, operational restrictions resulting from environmental limitations and governmental interventions, and performance below expected levels. The Companies businesses are dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could prevent them from accomplishing critical business functions. Because the Companies transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of their facilities and pipelines could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties.
Operation of the Companies facilities below expected capacity levels could result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs. Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Companies business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Companies operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce their revenues as a result of selling less output or may require the Companies to incur significant costs as a result of operating higher cost units or obtaining replacement output from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward energy and capacity or other contractual obligations.Moreover, if the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result.
In addition, there are many risks associated with the Companies operations and the transportation, storage and processing of natural gas and NGLs, including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes, electric contact cases, the collision of third party equipment with pipelines and avian and other wildlife impacts. Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general, environmental pollution, damage or destruction of facilities or business interruptions and associated public or employee safety impacts, loss of revenues, increased liabilities, heightened regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk. Further, the location of pipelines and storage facilities, or generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated 28 Table of Contents areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.
Dominion and Virginia Power have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units; as a result, each may incur substantial costs and liabilities.
Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks such as the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommission ing, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available, potential operational liabilities and extended outages, the costs of replacement power, the costs of maintenance and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks. Dominion and Virginia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that future decommissioning costs could exceed amounts in the decommissioning trusts and/or damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If Dominions and Virginia Powers decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and they are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance, or in the case of Virginia Power through regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations could be negatively impacted.
Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear facilities are also subject to complex government regulation which could negatively impact their results of operations. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, set license conditions, shut down a nuclear unit, or take some combination of these actions, depending on its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Dominion and Virginia Power to make substantial expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although the Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and/or financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations or otherwise limit or restrict the operation or licensing of domestic nuclear units.
Sustained declines in natural gas and NGL prices have resulted in, and could result in further, curtailments of third-party producers drilling programs, delaying the production of volumes of natural gas and NGLs that Dominion and Dominion Gas gather, process, and transport and reducing the value of NGLs retained by Dominion Gas, which may adversely affect Dominion and Dominion Gas revenues and earnings.
Dominion and Dominion Gas obtain their supply of natural gas and NGLs from numerous third-party producers. Most producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas facilities. A number of other factors could reduce the volumes of natural gas and NGLs available to Dominions and Dominion Gas pipelines and other assets. Increased regulation of energy extraction activities could result in reductions in drilling for new natural gas wells, which could decrease the volumes of natural gas supplied to Dominion and Dominion Gas. Producers with direct commodity price exposure face liquidity constraints, which could present a credit risk to Dominion and Dominion Gas. Producers could shift their production activities to regions outside Dominions and Dominion Gas footprint. In addition, the extent of natural gas reserves and the rate of production from such reserves may be less than anticipated. If producers were to decrease the supply of natural gas or NGLs to Dominions and Dominion Gas systems and facilities for any reason, Dominion and Dominion Gas could experience lower revenues to the extent they are unable to replace the lost volumes on similar terms. In addition, Dominion Gas revenue from processing and fractionation operations largely results from the sale of commodities at market prices.Dominion Gas receives the wet gas product from producers and may retain the extracted NGLs as compensation for its services.This exposes Dominion Gas to commodity price risk for the value of the spread between the NGL products and natural gas, and relative changes in these prices could adversely impact Dominion Gas results.
Dominions merchant power business operates in a challenging market, which could adversely affect its results of operations and future growth.
The success of Dominions merchant power business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs. Dominion operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties. Dominion attempts to manage its price risk by entering into hedging transactions, including short-term and long-term fixed price sales and purchase contracts.
In these wholesale markets, the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. In many cases, the next unit of electricity supplied would be provided by generating stations that consume fossil fuels, primarily natural gas. Consequently, the open market wholesale price for electricity generally reflects the cost of natural gas plus the cost to convert the fuel to electricity. Therefore, changes in the price of natural gas generally affect the open market wholesale price of electricity. To the extent Dominion does not enter into long-term power purchase agreements or otherwise effectively hedge its output, these changes in market prices could adversely affect its financial results.
Dominion purchases fuel under a variety of terms, including long-term and short-term contracts and spot market purchases. Dominion is exposed to fuel cost volatility for the portion of its fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market, including as a result of market supply shortages. Fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced from such fuel may not change at the same rate as fuel costs, thus adversely impacting Dominions financial results.
In addition, in the event that any of the merchant generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated.
The Companies financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving demand for electricity and gas and related services.
Technological advances required by federal laws mandate new levels of energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Additionally, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are 29 Table of Contents considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by a fixed date. Further, Virginia Powers business model is premised upon the cost efficiency of the production, transmission and distribution of large-scale centralized utility generation. However, advances in distributed generation technologies, such as solar cells, gas microturbines and fuel cells, may make these alternative generation methods competitive with large-scale utility generation, and change how customers acquire or use our services.
Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, distributed generation, regional economic conditions, or the impact of additional compliance obligations, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact the value of the Companies business activities.
Dominion Gas has experienced a decline in demand for certain of its processing services due to competing facilities operating in nearby areas.
Dominion Gas may not be able to maintain, renew or replace its existing portfolio of customer contracts successfully, or on favorable terms.
Upon contract expiration, customers may not elect to re-contract with Dominion Gas as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount of competition in the industry, changes in the price of natural gas, their level of satisfaction with Dominion Gas services, the extent to which Dominion Gas is able to successfully execute its business plans and the effect of the regulatory framework on customer demand. The failure to replace any such customer contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue for Dominion Gas.
Certain of Dominion and Dominion Gas gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price negotiated rate contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.
Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a negotiated rate which may be above or below the FERC regulated, cost-based recourse rate for that service. These negotiated rate contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs which could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. Any shortfall of revenue as result of these negotiated rate contracts could decrease Dominion and Dominion Gas earnings and cash flows.
Exposure to counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies financial results of operations.
The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations, including but not limited to payment for services. For example, some of Dominions operations are conducted through less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, such as Four Brothers and Three Cedars. In such arrangements, Dominion is dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures. Counterparties could fail or delay the perform ance of their contractual obligations for a number of reasons, including the effect of regulations on their operations. Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, joint venture partners or other third parties may adversely affect the Companies financial results.
Dominion will also be exposed to counterparty credit risk relating to the terminal services agreements for the Liquefaction Project. While the counterparties obligations are supported by parental guarantees and letters of credit, there is no assurance that such credit support would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations in the event of a counterparty default. In addition, if a controversy arises under either agreement resulting in a judgment in Dominions favor, Dominion may need to seek to enforce a final U.S. court judgment in a foreign tribunal, which could involve a lengthy process.
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of Dominions decommissioning trust funds and Dominions and Dominion Gas benefit plan assets or increase Dominions and Dominion Gas liabilities, which could then require significant additional funding.
The performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trusts to satisfy future obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants and under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Dominion and Dominion Gas have significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates.
With respect to decommissioning trust funds, a decline in the market value of these assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations to decommission Dominions nuclear plants or require additional NRC-approved funding assurance.
A decline in the market value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy future obligations under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans may increase the funding requirements under such plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates will affect the liabilities under Dominions and Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in mortality assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
If the decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets are negatively impacted by market fluctuations or other factors, Dominions and Dominion Gas results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be negatively affected.
The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints.
The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity and financial market risks. In addition, Dominion and Dominion Gas purchase and sell commodity-based contracts for hedging purposes.
The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be 30 Table of Contents established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable regulators, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, the Companies derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the swaps provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities.
Changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect the Companies growth and business strategy.
In order to maintain appropriate credit ratings to obtain needed credit at a reasonable cost in light of existing or future rating agency requirements, the Companies may find it necessary to take steps or change their business plans in ways that may adversely affect their growth and earnings. A reduction in the Companies credit ratings could result in an increase in borrowing costs, loss of access to certain markets, or both, thus adversely affecting operating results and could require the Companies to post additional collateral in connection with some of its price risk management activities.
An inability to access financial markets could adversely affect the execution of the Companies business plans.
The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans with increasing capital expenditure needs, normal working capital and collateral requirements related to hedges of future sales and purchases of energy-related commodities. Deterioration in the Companies creditworthiness, as evaluated by credit rating agencies or otherwise, or declines in market reputation either for the Companies or their industry in general, or general financial market disruptions outside of the Companies control could increase their cost of borrowing or restrict their ability to access one or more financial markets. Further market disruptions could stem from delays in the current economic recovery, the bankruptcy of an unrelated company, general market disruption due to general credit market or political events, or the failure of financial institutions on which the Companies rely. Increased costs and restrictions on the Companies ability to access financial markets may be severe enough to affect their ability to execute their business plans as scheduled.
Potential changes in accounting practices may adversely affect the Companies financial results.
The Companies cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on public companies in general, the energy industry or their operations specifically. New accounting standards could be issued that could change the way they record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect earnings or could increase liabilities.
War, acts and threats of terrorism, intentional acts and other significant events could adversely affect the Companies operations.
The Companies cannot predict the impact that any future terrorist attacks may have on the energy industry in general, or on the Companies business in particular. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign may affect the Companies operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets. In addition, the Companies infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. For example, a physical attack on a critical substation in California resulted in serious impacts to the power grid. Furthermore, the physical compromise of the Companies facilities could adversely affect the Companies ability to manage these facilities effectively. Instability in financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, intentional acts, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors could result in a significant decline in the U.S. economy and increase the cost of insurance coverage. This could negatively impact the Companies results of operations and financial condition.
Hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Companies business.
The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the computer systems that run the Companies facilities are not completely isolated from external networks. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular nation state actors, that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system and the U.S. gas transmission or distribution system. Such parties could view the Companies computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack. For example, malware has been designed to target software that runs the nations critical infrastructure such as power transmission grids and gas pipelines. In addition, the Companies businesses require that they and their vendors collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss.
A successful cyber attack on the systems that control the Companies electric generation, electric or gas transmission or distribution assets could severely disrupt business operations, preventing the Companies from serving customers or collecting revenues. The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to the Companies reputation. In addition, the misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring. The Companies maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain damage caused by potential cyber incidents; however, other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could materially and adversely affect the Companies business, financial condition and results of operations.
Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other appropriately qualified employees could have an adverse effect on the Companies operations.
The Companies business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. The Companies key executive officers are the CEO, CFO and presidents and those responsible for financial, operational, legal, regulatory and accounting functions. Competition 31 Table of Contents for skilled management employees in these areas of the Companies business operations is high. In addition, certain specialized knowledge is required of the Companies technical employees for transmission, generation and distribution operations. The Companies inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results. An aging workforce in the energy industry also necessitates recruiting, retaining and developing the next generation of leadership.
Dominion may be unable to complete the Questar Combination or, in order to do so, the combined company may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions.
On February 1, 2016, Dominion announced the execution of a merger agreement with Questar. Before the Questar Combination may be completed, approval by the shareholders of Questar will have to be obtained. In addition, various filings must be made with various state utility, regulatory, antitrust and other authorities in the U.S. These governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms, of the transaction, including restrictions or conditions on the business, operations, or financial performance of the combined company following completion of the transaction. Several parties have filed a complaint in court seeking to enjoin the merger. Additional parties may also seek to enjoin the merger in court or challenge regulatory filings. These conditions, changes or challenges could have the effect of delaying completion of the acquisition or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the combined company and/or cause either Dominion or Questar to abandon the transaction.
If completed, the Questar Combination may not achieve its intended results.
Dominion and Questar entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the transaction would result in various benefits, including, among other things, being accretive to earnings and adding to Dominions inventory of regulated energy infrastructure assets. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business of Questar is integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of managements time and energy, all of which could have an adverse effect on the combined companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Failure to complete the transaction with Questar could negatively impact Dominions stock price and Dominions future business and financial results.
If the Questar Combination is not completed, Dominions ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and Dominion will be subject to a number of risks, including (i) Dominion may be required, under specified circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, to pay Questar a termination fee of $154 million; (ii) Dominion will be required to pay costs relating to the transaction, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing costs, whether or not the transaction is completed; and (iii) execution of the Questar Combination (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Dominion.
Dominion could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction with Questar. If the transaction is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect Dominions financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

D OMINION E NERGY Dominion and Dominion Gas East Ohios gas distribution network is located in Ohio. This network involves approximately 18,900 miles of pipe, exclusive of service lines. The rights-of-way grants for many natural gas pipelines have been obtained from the actual owners of real estate, as underlying titles have been examined. Where rights-of-way have not been obtained, they could be acquired from private owners by condemnation, if necessary. Many natural gas pipelines are on publicly-owned property, where company rights and actions are determined on a case-by-case basis, with results that range from reimbursed relocation to revocation of permission to operate.
Dominion Gas has approximately 10,500 miles of gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines located in the states of Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Dominion Gas also owns NGL processing plants capable of processing over 270,000 mcf per day of natural gas.

A CCOUNTING M ATTERS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Dominion has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.
A CCOUNTING FOR R EGULATED O PERATIONS The accounting for Dominions regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that Dominion is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.
Dominion evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analysis. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS Dominion recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Dominion estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When Dominion revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, Dominion adjusts the carrying amount of the ARO liability with such changes recognized in income. Dominion accretes the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2015, Dominion recorded an increase in AROs of $403 million primarily related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In 2015, 2014 and 2013, Dominion recognized $93 million, $81 million and $86 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $99 million in 2016. Dominion records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs as an adjustment to the regulatory liability related to its nuclear decommissioning trust.
41 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued A significant portion of Dominions AROs relates to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December31,2015, Dominions nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.5 billion, representing approximately 70% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with Dominions nuclear decommissioning obligations.
Dominion obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, Dominions cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. Dominion determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.
Primarily as a result of a shift of the delayed planned date on which the DOE was expected to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, in 2014, Dominion recorded an increase of $95 million to the nuclear decommissioning AROs.
I NCOME T AXES Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.
Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December31,2015, Dominion had $103 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. Dominion establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December31,2015, Dominion had established $73 million of valuation allowances.
A CCOUNTING FOR D ERIVATIVE C ONTRACTS AND O THER I NSTRUMENTS AT F AIR V ALUE Dominion uses derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage commodity and financial market risks of its business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominions nuclear decommissioning and rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements.
Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, Dominion considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if Dominion believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, Dominion must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.
Dominion maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
U SE OF E STIMATES IN G OODWILL I MPAIRMENT T ESTING As of December31,2015, Dominion reported $3.3 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000.
In April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.
In general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominions estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominions estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same 42 Table of Contents methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
U SE OF E STIMATES IN L ONG -L IVED A SSET I MPAIRMENT T ESTING Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an assets carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.
E MPLOYEE B ENEFIT P LANS Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominions assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.
The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:  Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions;  Historical return analysis to determine long-term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes;  Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;  Forecasts of an independent investment advisor;  Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and  Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominions pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.
Strategic investment policies are established for Dominions prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of Dominions assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.
Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2015 and 2014 and 8.50% for 2013. For 2016, the expected long-term rate of return for pension cost assumption is 8.75%. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2015 and 2014 and 7.75% for 2013. For 2016, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.
Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 4.40% in 2015, ranged from 5.20% to 5.30% for pension plans and 5.00% to 5.10% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2014, and ranged from 4.40% to 4.80% in 2013. Dominion selected a discount rate ranging from 4.96% to 4.99% for pension plans and ranging from 4.93% to 4.94% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its December31, 2015 projected benefit obligations.
43 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominions healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December31, 2015 was 7.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2019 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.
Dominion develops its mortality assumption using plan-specific studies and projects mortality improvement using scales developed by the Society of Actuaries.
The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant: IncreaseinNetPeriodicCost Change in Actuarial Assumption Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits (millions, except percentages) Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 15 $ 1 Long-term rate of return on plan assets (0.25 )% 16 3 Healthcare cost trend rate 1 % N/A 21 In addition to the effects on cost, at December31, 2015, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominions projected pension benefit obligation by $212 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $40 million , while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $157 million .

The absence of losses related to the retail electric energy marketing business which was sold in the first quarter of 2014 ($129 million);  A $77 million increase from merchant generation operations, primarily due to increased generation output reflecting the absence of planned outages at certain merchant generation facilities ($83 million) and additional solar generating facilities placed into service ($53 million), partially offset by lower realized prices ($58 million);  A $38 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to an increase in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($12 million), an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($22 million); partially offset by a decrease in gathering revenues ($9 million); and  A $30 million increase from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily reflecting:  A $61 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to the addition of DCG ($62 million), decreased fuel costs ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($24 million), partially offset by decreased regulated gas sales ($46 million); and  A $46 million net increase primarily due to services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Blue Racer; partially offset by  A $61 million decrease from NGL activities, primarily due to decreased prices.
Other operations and maintenance decreased 6%, primarily reflecting:  The absence of charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities ($370 million);  An increase in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields ($63 million);  A $97 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain merchant generation facilities ($59 million) and non-nuclear utility generation facilities ($38 million); and  A $22 million decrease in charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.
These decreases were partially offset by:  The absence of a gain on the sale of Dominions electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014 ($100 million), net of a $31 million write-off of goodwill;  An $80 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures. These expenses are primarily recovered through state and FERC rates and do not impact net income;  The absence of gains on the sale of assets to Blue Racer ($59 million);  A $53 million increase in utility nuclear refueling outage costs primarily due to the amortization of outage costs that were previously deferred pursuant to Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014;  A $46 million net increase due to services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Blue Racer. These expenses are billed to these entities and do not significantly impact net income; and  A $22 million increase due to the acquisition of DCG.
Other income decreased 22%, primarily reflecting lower tax recoveries associated with contributions in aid of construction ($17 million), a decrease in interest income related to income taxes ($12 million), and lower net realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($11 million).
Interest and related charges decreased 24%, primarily as a result of the absence of charges associated with Dominions Liability Management Exercise in 2014.
Income tax expense increased 100%, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income.
2014 VS . 2013 Net revenue decreased 3%, primarily reflecting:  A $263 million decrease from retail energy marketing operations, primarily due to the sale of the retail electric business in March 2014; and  A $195 million decrease primarily related to the repositioning of Dominions producer services business which was completed in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the termination of natural gas trading and certain energy marketing activities.
These decreases were partially offset by:  A $171 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:  An increase from rate adjustment clauses at electric utility operations ($132 million); and  An increase in sales from electric utility operations primarily due to an increase in heating degree days ($34 million);  A $46 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities and other revenues, largely due to various expansion projects being placed into service; and  A $35 million increase in merchant generation margins, primarily due to higher realized prices ($120 million), partially offset by lower generation output due to the decommissioning of Kewaunee beginning in May 2013 ($95 million).
Other operations and maintenance increased 12%, primarily reflecting:  $370 million in charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities;  A $135 million increase in planned outage costs at certain merchant generation facilities and at certain non-nuclear utility facilities; and  A $121 million charge related to a settlement offer to incur future ash pond closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.
45 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued These increases were partially offset by:  A gain on the sale of Dominions electric retail energy marketing business in March 2014 ($100 million), net of a $31 million write-off of goodwill;  A $67 million decrease primarily due to the deferral of utility nuclear outage costs beginning in the second quarter of 2014, pursuant to the Virginia legislation enacted in April 2014;  The absence of a $65 million charge primarily reflecting impairment charges recorded in 2013 for certain natural gas infrastructure assets; and  A decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low-income assistance programs ($53 million). These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income.
Interest and related charges increased 36%, primarily due to charges associated with Dominions Liability Management Exercise in 2014 ($284 million) and higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in 2014 ($44 million).
Income tax expense decreased 49%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income ($350 million) and the impact of federal renewable energy investment tax credits ($105 million).
Loss from discontinued operations reflects the sale of Brayton Point and Kincaid in 2013.
Outlook Dominions strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide EPS growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.
In 2016, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2015. Dominions anticipated 2016 results reflect the following significant factors:  A return to normal weather in its electric utility operations;  Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of approximately 1%;  Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue;  The absence of a write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015 and decreased charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities;  A lower effective tax rate, driven primarily by additional investment tax credits;  Construction and operation of growth projects in gas transmission and distribution; partially offset by  An increase in depreciation, depletion, and amortization;  Higher operating and maintenance expenses; and  Share dilution.
Additionally, in 2016, Dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including by making investments in utility solar generation, particularly in Virginia.

L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Dominion depends on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.
At December31,2015, Dominion had $932 million of unused capacity under its credit facilities. See additional discussion below under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt.
A summary of Dominions cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December31, 2015 2014 2013 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 318 $ 316 $ 248 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 4,475 3,439 3,433 Investing activities (6,503 ) (5,181 ) (3,458 ) Financing activities 2,317 1,744 93 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 289 2 68 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 607 $ 318 $ 316 Operating Cash Flows Net cash provided by Dominions operating activities increased $1.0 billion, primarily due to the absence of losses related to the repositioning of Dominions producer services business in 2014, higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, higher revenue from rate adjustment clauses, lower outage costs and the absence of losses related to the retail electric energy marketing business in 2014.
Dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In December 2015, Dominions Board of Directors affirmed the dividend policy it set in February 2015 targeting a payout ratio of 70-75%, and established an annual dividend rate for 2016 of $2.80 per share of common stock, an 8.1% increase over the 2015 rate. Dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. In January 2016, Dominions Board of Directors declared dividends payable in March 2016 of 70 cents per share of common stock.
Dominions operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item1A. Risk Factors.
C REDIT R ISK Dominions exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominions credit exposure as of December31,2015 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.
Gross Credit Exposure Credit Collateral Net Credit Exposure (millions) Investment grade (1) $ 103 $ 48 $ 55 Non-investment grade (2) 2  2 No external ratings: Internally rated-investment grade (3) 14  14 Internally rated-non-investment grade (4) 30  30 Total $ 149 $ 48 $ 101 (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moodys and Standard& Poors. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 45% of the total net credit exposure.
(2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 2% of the total net credit exposure.
(3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 14% of the total net credit exposure.
(4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 20% of the total net credit exposure.
Investing Cash Flows In 2015, net cash used in Dominions investing activities increased $1.3 billion, primarily due to Dominions acquisition of DCG in 2015, an increase in acquisitions of solar development projects in 2015, and the absence of proceeds from the sale of Dominions electric retail energy marketing business in 2014.
Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Dominion relies on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings , Dominions ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.
Dominion currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration 50 Table of Contents process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.
In 2015, net cash provided by Dominions financing activities increased $573 million, primarily due to the issuance of common stock through an at-the-market program, proceeds from the sale of interest in merchant solar projects and the absence of subsidiary preferred stock redemption in 2014, partially offset by the absence of proceeds from the issuance of Dominion Midstream common units in 2014.
L IABILITY M ANAGEMENT During 2014, Dominion elected to redeem certain debt and preferred securities prior to their stated maturities.Proceeds from the issuance of lower-cost senior and enhanced junior subordinated notes were used to fund the redemption payments.See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of these redemptions.
From time to time, Dominion may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.
C REDIT F ACILITIES AND S HORT - TERM D EBT Dominion uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In January 2016, Dominion expanded its short-term funding resources through a $1.0 billion increase to one of its joint revolving credit facility limits. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominions credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.
In connection with commodity hedging activities, Dominion is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, Dominion may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, Dominion may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which Dominion can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.
Dominions commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows: December31, 2015 Facility Limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Joint revolving credit facility (1) (2) $ 4,000 $ 3,353 $  $ 647 Joint revolving credit facility (1) 500 156 59 285 Total $ 4,500 $ 3,509 (3) $ 59 $ 932 (1) These credit facilities mature in April 2019, and can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined $2.0 billion of letters of credit.
(2) In January 2016, this facility limit was increased from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion.
(3) The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominions credit facilities was 0.62% at December31, 2015.
S HORT - TERM N OTES In November 2014, Dominion issued $400 million of private placement short-term notes that matured and were repaid in November 2015 and bore interest at a variable rate. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
In November 2015, Dominion issued $400 million of private placement short-term notes that mature in May 2016 and bear interest at a variable rate. In December 2015, Dominion issued an additional $200 million of the variable rate short-term notes that mature in May 2016. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
In February 2016, Dominion purchased and cancelled $100 million of the variable rate short-term notes that would have otherwise matured in May 2016 using the proceeds from the February 2016 issuance of senior notes that mature in 2018. As a result, at December 31, 2015, $100 million of the notes were included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
L ONG - TERM D EBT During 2015, Dominion issued the following long-term debt: Type Principal Rate Maturity (millions) Senior notes $ 500 1.90 % 2018 Senior notes 700 2.80 % 2020 Senior notes 350 3.10 % 2025 Senior notes 650 3.90 % 2025 Senior notes 350 4.20 % 2045 Totalnotes issued $ 2,550 In August 2015, Virginia Power remarketed five series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $412 million to new investors.Two of the bonds will bear interest at a coupon rate of 1.75% until May 2019 after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. Three of the bonds will bear interest at a coupon rate of 2.15% until September 2020 after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. Previously, interest on all of the remarketed bonds was variable and reset monthly. This remarketing was accounted for as a debt extinguishment with the previous investors.

I SSUANCE OF C OMMON S TOCK AND O THER E QUITY S ECURITIES Dominion maintains Dominion Direct  and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in Dominions common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2014, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. In April 2014, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.
During 2015, Dominion issued 4.2million shares of common stock totaling $295 million through employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans and other employee and director benefit plans. Dominion received cash proceeds of $284 million from the issuance of 4.1million of such shares through Dominion Direct  and employee savings plans.
During 2015, Dominion issued 6.8 million shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of $499 million, net of fees and commissions paid of $3 million, through an at-the-market program and a registered underwritten public offering. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the at-the-market program and public offering.
During 2016, Dominion plans to issue shares for employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans, stock purchase contracts and to finance the Questar Combination. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of common stock to be issued by Dominion for stock purchase contracts.
R EPURCHASE OF C OMMON S TOCK Dominion did not repurchase any shares in 2015 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2016, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not count against its stock repurchase authorization.
P URCHASE OF D OMINION M IDSTREAM U NITS In September 2015, Dominion initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream. The common units may be acquired by Dominion over the 12 month period following commencement of the program at the discretion of management. Through December 31, 2015, Dominion purchased approximately 887,000 common units for $25 million. In the first quarter of 2016, Dominion purchased approximately 377,000 additional common units for approximately $10 million. At February 23, 2016, Dominion still has the ability to purchase up to $15 million of common units under the program.
P ROPOSED A CQUISITION OF Q UESTAR Under the terms of the Questar Combination announced in February 2016, Dominion has agreed to pay Questar shareholders $25 per share, totaling approximately $4.4 billion as well as assume Questars outstanding debt, currently approximately $1.6 billion, which is expected to remain outstanding following the merger.Additionally, Dominion entered into agreements with several of its lending banks pursuant to whichthey have commit- ted to provide temporary debt financing consisting of a $3.9 billion acquisition facility. Dominion intends to permanently finance the transaction in a manner that supports its existing credit ratings targets by issuing a combination of common stock, mandatory convertibles (including RSNs) and debt at Dominion and indirectly through an issuance of common units at Dominion Midstream, the proceeds of which will be applied to pay Dominion for certain assets of Questar, which are expected to be contributed to Dominion Midstream.Subject to receipt of Questar shareholder and any required regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions, Dominion targets closing by the end of 2016.
Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominions credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.
Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual companys credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.
In November 2014, Standard & Poors changed Dominions rating outlook to negative from stable. In February 2016, Standard & Poors lowered the following ratings for Dominion: issuer to BBB+ from A-, senior unsecured debt securities to BBB from BBB+ and junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities to BBB- from BBB. In addition, Standard & Poors affirmed Dominions commercial paper rating of A-2 and revised its outlook to stable from negative.
Credit ratings as of February23, 2016 follow: Fitch Moodys Standard&Poors Dominion Issuer BBB+ Baa2 BBB+ Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ Baa2 BBB Junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities BBB- Baa3 BBB- Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 As of February23, 2016, Fitch, Moodys and Standard & Poors maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion.
52 Table of Contents A downgrade in an individual companys credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. Dominion works closely with Fitch, Moodys and Standard& Poors with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. Dominion may find it necessary to modify its business plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS.
Debt Covenants As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion.
Some of the typical covenants include:  The timely payment of principal and interest;  Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominions credit ratings to lenders;  Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets;  Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and  Limitations on liens.
Dominion is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facilities. In addition, Dominions credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.
As of December31,2015, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: Company MaximumAllowedRatio Actual Ratio (1) Dominion 65 % 61 % (1) Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated and remarketable subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
If Dominion or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under Dominions credit facilities, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facilities. In addition, if the defaulting company is Virginia Power, Dominions obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facilities could also be accelerated and the lenders commitments to Dominion could terminate.
Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities:  June 2006 hybrids;  September 2006 hybrids; and  June 2009 hybrids.
In October 2014, Dominion redeemed all of the June 2009 hybrids. The redemption was conducted in compliance with the RCC. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including terms of the RCCs.
At December31,2015, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominions hybrids were as follows: Hybrid RCC Termination Date DesignatedCoveredDebt Under RCC June 2006 hybrids 6/30/2036 September2006hybrids September 2006 hybrids 9/30/2036 June 2006 hybrids Dominion monitors these debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December31,2015, there have been no events of default under or changes to Dominions debt covenants.
Dividend Restrictions Certain agreements associated with Dominions credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominions ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at December31,2015.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes and equity units, initially in the form of corporate units, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
53 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS Dominion is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion is a party as of December31,2015. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominions current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2016.
2016 2017- 2018 2019- 2020 2021and thereafter Total (millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 1,926 $ 3,279 $ 4,250 $ 16,018 $ 25,473 Interest payments (2) 1,071 1,863 1,579 11,719 16,232 Leases (3) 67 116 68 153 404 Purchaseobligations (4) : Purchased electric capacity for utility operations 249 261 117 46 673 Fuel commitments for utility operations 1,183 1,270 523 1,645 4,621 Fuel commitments for nonregulated operations 94 165 87 159 505 Pipeline transportation and storage 202 351 306 1,237 2,096 Other (5) 1,884 157 15 6 2,062 Other long-term liabilities (6) : Other contractual obligations (7) 120 81 15 10 226 Total cash payments $ 6,796 $ 7,543 $ 6,960 $ 30,993 $ 52,292 (1) Based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. In February 2016, Dominion purchased and cancelled $100 million of variable rate short-term notes that would have otherwise matured in May 2016 using the proceeds from the February 2016 issuance of senior notes that mature in 2018. As a result, at December 31, 2015, $100 million of the notes were included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(2) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt and payments on related stock purchase contracts. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate or forward interest rate curve at December31, 2015 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instruments stated maturity. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Does not reflect Dominions ability to defer interest and stock purchase contract payments on junior subordinated notes or RSNs and equity units, initially in the form of Corporate Units.
(3) Primarily consists of operating leases.
(4) Amounts exclude open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined.
(5) Includes capital, operations, and maintenance commitments.
(6) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan obligations, which are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 12, 14 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $67 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(7) Includes interest rate swap agreements.
P LANNED C APITAL E XPENDITURES Dominions planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $6.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Dominions planned expenditures include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, the construction of the Liquefaction Project and funding of Dominions portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project.
Dominion expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors.
See DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy-Properties in Item1. Business for a discussion of Dominions expansion plans.
These estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominions Board of Directors in late 2015 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. Dominion may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.
Use of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements G UARANTEES Dominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others .
See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
F UTURE I SSUES AND O THER M ATTERS See Item1. Business and Notes 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
Environmental Matters Dominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.
E NVIRONMENTAL P ROTECTION AND M ONITORING E XPENDITURES Dominion incurred $190 million, $192 million and $182 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities, excluding charges related to ash pond and landfill closure costs, and expects these expenses to be approximately $186 million and $187 million in 2016 and 2017, 54 Table of Contents respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $59 million, $101 million, and $64 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $85 million and $113 million for 2016 and 2017, respectively.
F UTURE E NVIRONMENTAL R EGULATIONS Air The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nations air quality. At a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies facilities are subject to the CAAs permitting and other requirements.
In August 2015, the EPA issued final carbon standards for existing fossil fuel power plants. Known as the Clean Power Plan, the rule uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. The new rule requires states to impose standards of performance limits for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units or equivalent statewide intensity-based or mass-based CO 2 binding goals or limits. States are required to submit interim plans to the EPA by September 2016 identifying how they will comply with the rule, with final plans due by September 2018. The EPA also proposed a federal plan and model trading rules that, when finalized, states can adopt or that would be put in place if, in response to the final guidelines, a state either does not submit a state plan or its plan is not approved by the EPA. Virginia Powers most recent integrated resources plan filed in July 2015 includes four alternative plans that represent plausible compliance strategies with the rule as proposed, and which include additional coal unit retirements and additional low or zero-carbon resources. The final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the Clean Power Plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the Court of Appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the U.S. Supreme Court. Dominion does not know whether these legal challenges will impact the submittal deadlines for the state implementation plans. Subsequent to the stay, Virginia has announced that it will continue development of a state plan. Unless the rule survives the court challenges and until the state plans are developed and the EPA approves the plans, Dominion cannot predict the potential financial statement impacts but believes the potential expenditures to comply could be material.
In December 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that set a more stringent annual air quality standard for fine particulate matter. The EPA issued final attainment/nonattainment designations in January 2015. Until states develop their implementation plans, Dominion cannot determine whether or how facilities located in areas designated nonattainment for the standard will be impacted, but does not expect such impacts to be material.
The EPA has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour NAAQS for NO 2 and a new 1-hour NAAQS for SO 2 , which could require additional NO X and SO 2 controls in certain areas where Dominion operates. Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominions facilities that emit NO X and SO 2 is uncertain. Additionally, the impact of permit limits for implementing NAAQS on Dominions facilities is uncertain at this time.
In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the Regional Haze Rule, also known as the Clean Air Visibility Rule. The rule requires the states to implement best available retrofit technology requirements for sources to address impacts to visual air quality through regional haze state implementation plans, but allows other alternative options. Dominion anticipates that the emission reductions achieved through compliance with other CAA-required programs will generally address this rule.
In December 2015, the EPA published a proposed revision to CSAPR. The proposal substantially reduces the CSAPR Phase II ozone season NO X emission caps in 23 states including Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina, relative to the Phase II caps under the current CSAPR rule, that would take effect beginning with the 2017 ozone season. The proposed reductions in state ozone season NO X caps would in turn reduce, by approximately 55% overall, the number of allowances Dominion electric generating units will receive under the CSAPR ozone season NO X program beginning with the 2017 May - September ozone season. In addition, the EPA is proposing to discount the use of banked Phase I allowances for compliance in Phase II by applying either a 2:1 or 4:1 surrender ratio. Until the proposal is finalized, Dominion is unable to predict with certainty the impact to future CSAPR ozone season allowance streams and to what extent the rule may require additional controls. The EPA expects to issue a final revision to CSAPR in August 2016.
In April 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued proposed regulations to reduce NO X and VOC emissions from combustion sources.The regulations are expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2016. To comply with the regulations, Dominion Gas anticipates installing emission control systems on existing engines at several compressor stations in Pennsylvania.Until the regulations are finalized, Dominion Gas cannot estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows related to this matter.
Climate Change In December 2015, the Paris Agreement was formally adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The accord establishes a universal framework for addressing GHG emissions involving actions by all nations through the concept of nationally determined contributions in which each nation defines the GHG commitment it can make and sets in place a process for increasing those commitments every five years.It also contains a global goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible.
A key element of the initial U.S. nationally determined contributions of achieving a 26% to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2025 is the implementation ofthe Clean Power Plan, which establishes interim emission reduction targets for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units over the period 2022 through 55 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued 2029 with final targets to be achieved by 2030.The EPA estimates that the Clean Power Plan will result in a nationwide reduction in CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.
Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The CEA, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires certain over-the counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the CEAs clearing requirements. Dominion has elected to exempt its swaps from the CEAs clearing requirements. The CFTC may continue to adopt final rules and implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act through its ongoing rulemaking process, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominions derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. In addition, Dominions swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with the implementation of, and compliance with, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Due to the ongoing rulemaking process, Dominion is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Acts derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Item7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The matters discussed in this Item may contain forward-looking statements as described in the introductory paragraphs of Item7. MD&A. The readers attention is directed to those paragraphs and Item1A. Risk Factors for discussion of various risks and uncertainties that may impact the Companies.
M ARKET R ISK S ENSITIVE I NSTRUMENTS AND R ISK M ANAGEMENT The Companies financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity security prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in Dominions and Virginia Powers electric operations and Dominions and Dominion Gas natural gas procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities.
The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a 10% change in commodity prices or interest rates.
Commodity Price Risk To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power primarily hold commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products and Dominion Gas primarily holds commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy-related products.
The repositioning of Dominions producer services business was completed in the first quarter of 2014. This, combined with Dominions sale of its electric retail energy marketing business, has reduced Dominions commodity price risk exposure.
The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may include instruments such as futures, forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based financial derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable market prices.
A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices of Dominions commodity-based financial derivative instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $62million and $101million as of December31,2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in sensitivity is largely due to decreased commodity derivative activity and lower commodity prices.
A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would not have resulted in a material change in the fair value of Virginia Powers commodity-based financial derivatives as of December31,2015 or 2014.
A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices of Dominion Gas commodity-based financial derivative instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $5million and $2million as of December31, 2015 and2014, respectively. The increase in sensitivity is largely due to an increase in commodity derivative volume.
The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on the Companies commodity-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity.
Interest Rate Risk The Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. They also enter into interest rate sensitive derivatives, including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. For variable rate debt and interest rate swaps designated under fair value hedging and outstanding for the Companies, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would not have resulted in a material change in annual earnings at December31, 2015 or 2014.
The Companies may also use forward-starting interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements as anticipatory hedges. As of December31, 2015, Dominion, Virginia Power and Domin- 56 Table of Contents ion Gas had $4.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $250 million, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $71million, $52 million and $2 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominions, Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas interest rate derivatives at December31, 2015. As of December31, 2014, Dominion, Virginia Power and Dominion Gas had $4.1 billion, $1.5 billion and $250 million, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $46 million, $25 million and $2 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominions, Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas interest rate derivatives at December31, 2014.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the Companies interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.
Investment Price Risk Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
Dominion recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $184 million and $176 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Dominion recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net decrease in unrealized gains of $157 million in 2015, and a net increase in unrealized gains of $172 million in 2014.
Virginia Power recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of $88 million and $77 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded, in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net decrease in unrealized gains of $76 million in 2015, and a net increase in unrealized gains of $87 million in 2014.
Dominion sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas employees participate in these plans. Dominions pension and other postretirement plan assets experienced aggregate actual losses of $72 million in 2015 and aggregate actual returns of $706 million in 2014, versus expected returns of $648million and $610 million, respectively. Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement plan assets for employees represented by collective bargaining units experienced aggregate actual losses of $13million in 2015 and aggregate actual returns of $157million in 2014, versus expected returns of $150million and $138 million, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans. A hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rates of return on Dominions plan assets would result in an increase in net periodic cost of $16 million and $15 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for pension benefits and $3 million as of both December31, 2015 and 2014, for other postretirement benefits. A hypothetical 0.25% decrease in the assumed long-term rates of return on Dominion Gas plan assets, for employees represented by collective bargaining units, would result in an increase in net periodic cost of $4 million as of both December31, 2015 and 2014 for pension benefits and $1 million as of both December31, 2015 and 2014, for other postretirement benefits.
Risk Management Policies The Companies have established operating procedures with corporate management to ensure that proper internal controls are maintained. In addition, Dominion has established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the credit and commodity risk management policies of all subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas. Dominion maintains credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterpartys financial condition, collateral requirements where deemed necessary and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, Dominion also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Based on these credit policies and the Companies December31,2015 provision for credit losses, management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on the Companies financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

73 Table of Contents [THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK] 74 Table of Contents R EPORT OF I NDEPENDENT R EGISTERED P UBLIC A CCOUNTING F IRM To the Board of Directors of Dominion Gas Holdings, LLC Richmond, Virginia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dominion Gas Holdings, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc.) and subsidiaries (Dominion Gas) as of December31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015.These financial statements are the responsibility of Dominion Gas management.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.Dominion Gas is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Dominion Gas internal control over financial reporting.Accordingly, we express no such opinion.An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dominion Gas Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries as of December31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

81 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements N OTE 1. N ATURE OF O PERATIONS Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is one of the nations largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominions operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas. Virginia Power is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Virginia Power is a member of PJM, an RTO, and its electric transmission facilities are integrated into the PJM wholesale electricity markets. All of Virginia Powers stock is owned by Dominion. Dominion Gas is a holding company that conducts business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in Ohio, and gas gathering and processing activities primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. All of Dominion Gas membership interests are held by Dominion.
Dominions operations also include an LNG import, transport and storage facility in Maryland, a preferred equity interest in which was contributed to Dominion Midstream in 2014, an equity investment in Atlantic Coast Pipeline and regulated gas transportation and distribution operations in West Virginia. Dominions nonregulated operations include merchant generation, energy marketing and price risk management activities, retail energy marketing operations and an equity investment in Blue Racer.
In October 2014, Dominion Midstream launched its initial public offering of 20,125,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of $21 per unit, which included an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 2,625,000 common units at the initial offering price, which was exercised in full by the underwriters. Dominion received $392 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting discounts, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. At December 31, 2015, Dominion owns the general partner and 64.1% of the limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream, which owns a preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point, DCG and a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. The publics ownership interest in Dominion Midstream is reflected as non-controlling interest in Dominions Consolidated Financial Statements.
Dominion manages its daily operations through three primary operating segments: DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy. Dominion also reports a Corporate and Other segment, which includes its corporate, service company and other functions (including unallocated debt) and the net impact of operations that are discontinued, which is discussed in Notes 3 and 25. In addition, Corporate and Other includes specific items attributable to Dominions operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or allocating resources among the segments.
Virginia Power manages its daily operations through two primary operating segments: DVP and Dominion Generation. It also reports a Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segments that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance or allocating resources among the segments.
Dominion Gas manages its daily operations through one primary operating segment: Dominion Energy. It also reports a Corporate and Other segment that primarily includes specific items attributable to its operating segment that are not included in profit measures evaluated by executive management in assessing the segments performance and the effect of certain items recorded at Dominion Gas as a result of the recognition of Dominions basis in the net assets contributed.
See Note 25 for further discussion of the Companies operating segments.
N OTE 2. S IGNIFICANT A CCOUNTING P OLICIES General The Companies make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses and cash flows for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Companies Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries and non-wholly-owned entities in which they have a controlling financial interest. For certain partnership structures, income is allocated based on the liquidation value of the underlying contractual arrangements. SunEdisons ownership interest in Four Brothers and Three Cedars, as well as Terra Nova Renewable Partners 33% interest in certain of Dominions merchant solar projects, is reflected as noncontrolling interest in Dominions Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3 for further information on transactions with SunEdison.
The Companies report certain contracts, instruments and investments at fair value. See Note 6 for further information on fair value measurements.
Dominion maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas participate in certain of these plans. See Note 21 for further information on these plans.
Certain amounts in the 2014 and 2013 Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect the Companies net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows.
Amounts disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power and/or Dominion Gas, where applicable.
Operating Revenue Operating revenue is recorded on the basis of services rendered, commodities delivered or contracts settled and includes amounts yet to be billed to customers. Dominion and Virginia Power collect sales, consumption and consumer utility taxes and Dominion Gas collects sales taxes; however, these amounts are excluded from revenue. Dominions customer receivables at December31,2015 and 2014 included $462 million and $564 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity and natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its utility 82 Table of Contents customers. Virginia Powers customer receivables at December31,2015 and 2014 included $333 million and $407 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of electricity delivered but not yet billed to its customers. Dominion Gas customer receivables at December31,2015 and 2014 included $98 million and $127 million, respectively, of accrued unbilled revenue based on estimated amounts of natural gas delivered but not yet billed to its customers.
The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion are as follows:  Regulated electric sales consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales, and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services;  Nonregulated electric sales consist primarily of sales of electricity at market-based rates and contracted fixed rates, and associated derivative activity;  Regulated gas sales consist primarily of state- and FERC-regulated natural gas sales and related distribution services;  Nonregulated gas sales consist primarily of sales of natural gas production at market-based rates and contracted fixed prices, sales of gas purchased from third parties, gas trading and marketing revenue and associated derivative activity;  Gas transportation and storage consists primarily of FERC-regulated sales of gathering, transmission, distribution and storage services. Also included are state-regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for alternate suppliers; and  Other revenue consists primarily of sales of NGL production and condensate, extracted products and associated derivative activity. Other revenue also includes miscellaneous service revenue from electric and gas distribution operations, and gas processing and handling revenue.
The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Virginia Power are as follows:  Regulated electric sales consist primarily of state-regulated retail electric sales and federally-regulated wholesale electric sales and electric transmission services; and  Other revenue consists primarily of miscellaneous service revenue from electric distribution operations and miscellaneous revenue from generation operations, including sales of capacity and other commodities.
The primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenue for Dominion Gas are as follows:  Regulated gas sales consist primarily of state- and FERC-regulated natural gas sales and related distribution services;  Nonregulated gas sales consist primarily of sales of natural gas production at market-based rates and contracted fixed prices and sales of gas purchased from third parties. Revenue from sales of gas production is recognized based on actual volumes of gas sold to purchasers and is reported net of royalties;  Gas transportation and storage consists primarily of FERC-regulated sales of gathering, transmission and storage services. Also included are state-regulated gas distribution charges to retail distribution service customers opting for alternate suppliers;  NGL revenue consists primarily of sales of NGL production and condensate, extracted products and associated derivative activity; and  Other revenue consists primarily of miscellaneous service revenue, gas processing and handling revenue.
Electric Fuel, Purchased Energy and Purchased Gas-Deferred Costs Where permitted by regulatory authorities, the differences between Dominions and Virginia Powers actual electric fuel and purchased energy expenses and Dominions and Dominion Gas purchased gas expenses and the related levels of recovery for these expenses in current rates are deferred and matched against recoveries in future periods. The deferral of costs in excess of current period fuel rate recovery is recognized as a regulatory asset, while rate recovery in excess of current period fuel expenses is recognized as a regulatory liability.
Of the cost of fuel used in electric generation and energy purchases to serve utility customers, approximately 84% is currently subject to deferred fuel accounting, while substantially all of the remaining amount is subject to recovery through similar mechanisms.
Virtually all of Dominion Gas, Cove Points and Hopes natural gas purchases are either subject to deferral accounting or are recovered from the customer in the same accounting period as the sale.
Income Taxes A consolidated federal income tax return is filed for Dominion and its subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas subsidiaries. In addition, where applicable, combined income tax returns for Dominion and its subsidiaries are filed in various states; otherwise, separate state income tax returns are filed.
Although Dominion Gas is disregarded for income tax purposes, a provision for income taxes is recognized to reflect the inclusion of its business activities in the tax returns of its parent, Dominion. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas participate in intercompany tax sharing agreements with Dominion and its subsidiaries. Current income taxes are based on taxable income or loss and credits determined on a separate company basis.
Under the agreements, if a subsidiary incurs a tax loss or earns a credit, recognition of current income tax benefits is limited to refunds of prior year taxes obtained by the carryback of the net operating loss or credit or to the extent the tax loss or credit is absorbed by the taxable income of other Dominion consolidated group members. Otherwise, the net operating loss or credit is carried forward and is recognized as a deferred tax asset until realized.
Accounting for income taxes involves an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided, representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Accordingly, deferred taxes are recognized for the future consequences of different treatments used for the reporting of transactions in financial accounting and income tax returns. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Where the treatment of temporary differences is different for rate-regulated operations, a regulatory asset is recognized if it is probable that future revenues will be 83 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued provided for the payment of deferred tax liabilities.
The Companies recognize positions taken, or expected to be taken, in income tax returns that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.
If it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained, the related tax benefits are not recognized in the financial statements. Unrecognized tax benefits may result in an increase in income taxes payable, a reduction of income tax refunds receivable or changes in deferred taxes. Also, when uncertainty about the deductibility of an amount is limited to the timing of such deductibility, the increase in income taxes payable (or reduction in tax refunds receivable) is accompanied by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities. Except when such amounts are presented net with amounts receivable from or amounts prepaid to tax authorities, noncurrent income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified in other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and current payables are included in accrued interest, payroll and taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Companies recognize interest on underpayments and overpayments of income taxes in interest expense and other income, respectively. Penalties are also recognized in other income.
Dominions, Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas interest and penalties were immaterial in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
At December 31, 2015, Virginia Powers Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $296 million affiliated receivable, representing current year excess federal income tax payments expected to be refunded, $9 million of federal income taxes payable for prior years, less than $1 million of state income taxes payable, $10 million of state income taxes receivable, $14 million of noncurrent state income taxes receivable and $2 million of noncurrent state income taxes payable.
At December 31, 2014, Virginia Powers Consolidated Balance Sheet included $225 million of federal and state income taxes receivable, $13 million of noncurrent state income taxes receivable and $38 million of noncurrent federal and state income taxes payable. In March 2015, Virginia Power received a $229 million refund of its 2014 federal income tax payments.
At December 31, 2015, Dominion Gas Consolidated Balance Sheet included $91 million of affiliated receivables, representing current year excess federal income tax payments expected to be refunded and the benefit of utilizing a subsidiarys tax loss to offset taxable income in Dominions consolidated tax return to be filed in 2016, less than $1 million of state income taxes payable, $4 million of state income taxes receivable and $22 million of noncurrent state income taxes payable.
At December 31, 2014, Dominion Gas Consolidated Balance Sheet included $96 million of federal and state income taxes receivable, $14 million of state income taxes payable, $7 million of noncurrent state income taxes payable and $20 million noncurrent state income taxes receivable. In March 2015, Dominion Gas received a $93 million refund of its 2014 federal income tax payments.
Investment tax credits are recognized by nonregulated operations in the year qualifying property is placed in service. For regulated operations, investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the service lives of the properties giving rise to the credits. Production tax credits are recognized as energy is generated and sold.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Current banking arrangements generally do not require checks to be funded until they are presented for payment. The following table illustrates the checks outstanding but not yet presented for payment and recorded in accounts payable for the Companies: Year Ended December31, 2015 2014 (millions) Dominion $ 27 $ 42 Virginia Power 11 20 Dominion Gas 7 9 For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.
Derivative Instruments Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage the commodity and financial market risks of their business operations. Dominion Gas uses derivative instruments such as physical and financial forwards, futures and swaps to manage commodity price and interest rate risks.
All derivatives, except those for which an exception applies, are required to be reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivative contracts representing unrealized gain positions and purchased options are reported as derivative assets. Derivative contracts representing unrealized losses and options sold are reported as derivative liabilities. One of the exceptions to fair value accounting, normal purchases and normal sales, may be elected when the contract satisfies certain criteria, including a requirement that physical delivery of the underlying commodity is probable. Expenses and revenues resulting from deliveries under normal purchase contracts and normal sales contracts, respectively, are included in earnings at the time of contract performance.
The Companies do not offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Dominion had margin assets of $16 million and $287 million associated with cash collateral at December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Dominions margin liabilities associated with cash collateral at December 31, 2015 were immaterial. Dominion had margin liabilities of $34 million associated with cash collateral at December31, 2014. Virginia Power did not have any margin assets associated with cash collateral at December31, 2015. Virginia Power had margin assets of $6 million associated with cash collateral at December31 2014. Virginia Power did not have any margin liabilities associated with cash collateral at December31, 2015 or 2014. Dominion Gas did not have any margin assets or liabilities related to cash collateral at December31, 2015 or 2014. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives.
To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power hold certain derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. However, to the extent Dominion and Virginia Power do not hold offsetting positions for such derivatives, they believe these instruments represent economic 84 Table of Contents hedges that mitigate their exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. As part of Dominions strategy to market energy and manage related risks, it formerly managed a portfolio of commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes. Dominion used established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with price fluctuations in these energy commodities and used various derivative instruments to reduce risk by creating offsetting market positions. In the second quarter of 2013, Dominion commenced a repositioning of its producer services business. The repositioning was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and resulted in the termination of natural gas trading and certain energy marketing activities.
Statement of Income Presentation:  Derivatives Held for Trading Purposes : All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue on a net basis.
Derivatives Not Held for Trading Purposes: All income statement activity, including amounts realized upon settlement, is presented in operating revenue, operating expenses or interest and related charges based on the nature of the underlying risk.
In Virginia Powers generation operations, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments result in the recognition of regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation. Realized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are generally recognized when the related transactions impact earnings.
D ERIVATIVE I NSTRUMENTS D ESIGNATED AS H EDGING I NSTRUMENTS The Companies designate a portion of their derivative instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges for accounting purposes. For all derivatives designated as hedges, the Companies formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for using the hedging instrument. The Companies assess whether the hedging relationship between the derivative and the hedged item is highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Any change in the fair value of the derivative that is not effective at offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged item is recognized currently in earnings. Also, the Companies may elect to exclude certain gains or losses on hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as gains or losses attributable to changes in the time value of options or changes in the difference between spot prices and forward prices, thus requiring that such changes be recorded currently in earnings. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively for derivatives that cease to be highly effective hedges. For derivative instruments that are accounted for as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, the cash flows from the derivatives and from the related hedged items are classified in operating cash flows.
Cash Flow Hedges A majority of the Companies hedge strategies represents cash flow hedges of the variable price risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, NGLs and other energy-related products. The Companies also use interest rate swaps to hedge their exposure to variable interest rates on long-term debt. For transactions in which the Companies are hedging the variability of cash flows, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in AOCI, to the extent they are effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. Any derivative gains or losses reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the forecasted item is included in earnings, or earlier, if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. For cash flow hedge transactions, hedge accounting is discontinued if the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is no longer probable.
Dominion entered into interest rate derivative instruments to hedge its forecasted interest payments related to planned debt issuances in 2013 and 2014. These interest rate derivatives were designated by Dominion as cash flow hedges in 2012 and 2013, prior to the formation of Dominion Gas. For the purposes of the Dominion Gas financial statements, the derivative balances, AOCI balance, and any income statement impact related to these interest rate derivative instruments entered into by Dominion have been, and will continue to be, included in the Dominion Gas Consolidated Financial Statements as the forecasted interest payments related to the debt issuances now occur at Dominion Gas.
Fair Value Hedges Dominion also uses fair value hedges to mitigate the fixed price exposure inherent in certain firm commodity commitments and commodity inventory. In addition, Dominion and Virginia Power have designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges on certain fixed rate long-term debt to manage interest rate exposure. For fair value hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative are generally offset currently in earnings by the recognition of changes in the hedged items fair value. Derivative gains and losses from the hedged item are reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is included in earnings, or earlier, if the hedged item no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedged item no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. See Note 6 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives. See Note 7 for further information on derivatives.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at lower of original cost or fair value, if impaired. Capitalized costs include labor, materials and other direct and indirect costs such as asset retirement costs, capitalized interest and, for certain operations subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, AFUDC and overhead costs. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including minor additions and replacements, is generally charged to expense as it is incurred.
In 2015, 2014 and 2013, Dominion capitalized interest costs and AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $100 million, $80 million and $66 million, respectively. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, Virginia Power capitalized AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $30 million, $39 million and $33 million, respectively. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, Dominion Gas capitalized AFUDC to property, plant and equipment of $1 million, $1 million and $5 million, respectively.
Under Virginia law, certain Virginia jurisdictional projects qualify for current recovery of AFUDC through rate adjustment clauses. AFUDC on these projects is calculated and recorded as a regulatory asset and is not capitalized to property, plant and equipment. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, Virginia Power recorded $19 million, $8 million and $32 million of AFUDC related to these projects, respectively.
85 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued For property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including Virginia Power electric distribution, electric transmission, and generation property, Dominion Gas natural gas distribution and transmission property, and for certain Dominion natural gas property, the undepreciated cost of such property, less salvage value, is generally charged to accumulated depreciation at retirement. Cost of removal collections from utility customers not representing AROs are recorded as regulatory liabilities. For property subject to cost-of-service rate regulation that will be abandoned significantly before the end of its useful life, the net carrying value is reclassified from plant-in-service when it becomes probable it will be abandoned.
For property that is not subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, including nonutility property, cost of removal not associated with AROs is charged to expense as incurred. The Companies also record gains and losses upon retirement based upon the difference between the proceeds received, if any, and the propertys net book value at the retirement date.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method based on projected service lives. The Companies average composite depreciation rates on utility property, plant and equipment are as follows: Year Ended December31, 2015 2014 2013 (percent) Dominion Generation 2.78 2.66 2.71 Transmission 2.42 2.38 2.36 Distribution 3.11 3.12 3.13 Storage 2.42 2.39 2.43 Gas gathering and processing 3.19 2.81 2.39 General and other 3.67 3.62 3.82 Virginia Power Generation 2.78 2.66 2.71 Transmission 2.33 2.34 2.28 Distribution 3.33 3.34 3.33 General and other 3.40 3.29 3.51 Dominion Gas Transmission 2.46 2.40 2.43 Distribution 2.45 2.47 2.50 Storage 2.44 2.40 2.43 Gas gathering and processing 3.20 2.82 2.39 General and other 4.72 5.77 5.93 In 2013, Virginia Power revised its depreciation rates to reflect the results of a new depreciation study. This change resulted in an increase of $19 million ($12 million after-tax) in depreciation and amortization expense in Virginia Powers Consolidated Statements of Income.
In 2014, Virginia Power also made a one-time adjustment to depreciation expense as ordered by the Virginia Commission.This adjustment resulted in an increase of $38 million ($23 million after-tax) in depreciation and amortization expense in Virginia Powers Consolidated Statements of Income.
In 2013, Dominion Gas revised the depreciation rates for East Ohio to reflect the results of a new depreciation study. This change resulted in a decrease of $8 million ($5 million after-tax) in depreciation and amortization expense in Dominion Gas Consolidated Statements of Income.
Dominions nonutility property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Asset EstimatedUsefulLives Merchant generation-nuclear 44years Merchant generation-other 15-36years General and other 5-59years Depreciation and amortization related to Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas nonutility property, plant and equipment and E&P properties was immaterial for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Nuclear fuel used in electric generation is amortized over its estimated service life on a units-of-production basis. Dominion and Virginia Power report the amortization of nuclear fuel in electric fuel and other energy-related purchases expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income and in depreciation and amortization in their Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets The Companies perform an evaluation for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. A long-lived or intangible asset is written down to fair value if the sum of its expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 6 for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities The accounting for Dominions and Dominion Gas regulated gas and Virginia Powers regulated electric operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.
The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made.
Asset Retirement Obligations The Companies recognize AROs at fair value as incurred or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement activities to be performed. These amounts are generally capitalized as costs of the 86 Table of Contents related tangible long-lived assets. Since relevant market information is not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. At least annually, the Companies evaluate the key assumptions underlying their AROs including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities. AROs are adjusted when significant changes in these assumptions are identified. Dominion and Dominion Gas report accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with their natural gas pipeline and storage well assets as an adjustment to the related regulatory liabilities when revenue is recoverable from customers for AROs. Virginia Power reports accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with decommissioning its nuclear power stations as an adjustment to the regulatory liability for certain jurisdictions. Additionally, Virginia Power reports accretion of AROs and depreciation on asset retirement costs associated with certain prospective rider projects as an adjustment to the regulatory asset for certain jurisdictions. Accretion of all other AROs and depreciation of all other asset retirement costs are reported in other operations and maintenance expense and depreciation expense, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Debt Issuance Costs The Companies defer and amortize debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts over the expected lives of the respective debt issues, considering maturity dates and, if applicable, redemption rights held by others. Deferred debt issuance costs are recorded as an asset and classified in other current assets and other deferred charges and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of the issuance costs is reported as interest expense. Unamortized costs associated with redemptions of debt securities prior to stated maturity dates are generally recognized and recorded in interest expense immediately. Effective January 2016, deferred debt issuance costs will be recorded as a reduction in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.As permitted by regulatory authorities, gains or losses resulting from the refinancing of debt allocable to utility operations subject to cost-based rate regulation are deferred and amortized over the lives of the new issuances.
Investments M ARKETABLE E QUITY AND D EBT S ECURITIES Dominion accounts for and classifies investments in marketable equity and debt securities as trading or available-for-sale securities. Virginia Power classifies investments in marketable equity and debt securities as available-for-sale securities.
Trading securities include marketable equity and debt securities held by Dominion in rabbi trusts associated with certain deferred compensation plans. These securities are reported in other investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Available-for-sale securities include all other marketable equity and debt securities, primarily comprised of securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts. These investments are reported at fair value in nuclear decommissioning trust funds in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any other-than-temporary impairments) on investments held in Virginia Powers nuclear decommissioning trusts are recorded to a regulatory liability for certain jurisdictions subject to cost-based regulation. For all other available-for-sale securities, including those held in Dominions merchant generation nuclear decommissioning trusts, net realized gains and losses (including any other-than-temporary impairments) are included in other income and unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of AOCI, after-tax.
In determining realized gains and losses for marketable equity and debt securities, the cost basis of the security is based on the specific identification method.
N ON - MARKETABLE I NVESTMENTS The Companies account for illiquid and privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available under either the equity or cost method. Non-marketable investments include:  Equity method investments when the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Dominions investments are included in investments in equity method affiliates and Virginia Powers investments are included in other investments in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies record equity method adjustments in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income including: their proportionate share of investee income or loss, gains or losses resulting from investee capital transactions, amortization of certain differences between the carrying value and the equity in the net assets of the investee at the date of investment and other adjustments required by the equity method.
Cost method investments when Dominion and Virginia Power do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. Dominions and Virginia Powers investments are included in other investments and nuclear decommissioning trust funds.
O THER - THAN - TEMPORARY I MPAIRMENT Dominion and Virginia Power periodically review their investments to determine whether a decline in fair value should be considered other-than-temporary. If a decline in fair value of any security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value at the end of the reporting period.
Decommissioning Trust InvestmentsSpecial Considerations  The recognition provisions of the FASBs other-than-temporary impairment guidance apply only to debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, while the presentation and disclosure requirements apply to both debt and equity securities.
Debt Securities Using information obtained from their nuclear decommissioning trust fixed-income investment managers, Dominion and Virginia Power record in earnings any unrealized loss for a debt security when the manager intends to sell the debt security or it is more-likely-than-not that the manager will have to sell the debt security before recovery of its fair value up to its cost basis. If that is not the case, but the debt security is deemed to have experienced a credit loss, Dominion and Virginia Power record the credit loss in earnings and any remaining portion of the unrealized 87 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued loss in AOCI. Credit losses are evaluated primarily by considering the credit ratings of the issuer, prior instances of non-performance by the issuer and other factors.
Equity securities and other investments Dominions and Virginia Powers method of assessing other-than-temporary declines requires demonstrating the ability to hold individual securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in their market value prior to the consideration of the other criteria mentioned above. Since Dominion and Virginia Power have limited ability to oversee the day-to-day management of nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, they do not have the ability to ensure investments are held through an anticipated recovery period. Accordingly, they consider all equity and other securities as well as non-marketable investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts with market values below their cost bases to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
Inventories Materials and supplies and fossil fuel inventories are valued primarily using the weighted-average cost method. Stored gas inventory for Dominion Gas used in East Ohio gas distribution operations is valued using the LIFO method. Under the LIFO method, stored gas inventory was valued at $24 million and $12 million at December31,2015 and December31, 2014, respectively. Based on the average price of gas purchased during 2015 and 2014, the cost of replacing the current portion of stored gas inventory exceeded the amount stated on a LIFO basis by $109 million and $98 million, respectively. Stored gas inventory for Dominion held by Hope and certain nonregulated gas operations is valued using the weighted-average cost method.
Gas Imbalances Natural gas imbalances occur when the physical amount of natural gas delivered from, or received by, a pipeline system or storage facility differs from the contractual amount of natural gas delivered or received. Dominion and Dominion Gas value these imbalances due to, or from, shippers and operators at an appropriate index price at period end, subject to the terms of its tariff for regulated entities. Imbalances are primarily settled in-kind. Imbalances due to Dominion and Dominion Gas from other parties are reported in other current assets and imbalances that Dominion and Dominion Gas owe to other parties are reported in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Goodwill Dominion and Dominion Gas evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of April1 and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
New Accounting Standards In May 2014, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The core principle of this revised accounting guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this update also require disclosure of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
For the Companies, the revised accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning January1, 2018. The Companies are currently in the preliminary stages of evaluating the impact of this guidance on their results of operations and overall liquidity. The Companies plan to complete their preliminary assessment, which includes a subset of representative contracts, in 2016. Once their initial evaluation is complete, the Companies will expand the scope of their assessment to include all contracts with customers. Other than increased disclosures, the impacts of the revised accounting guidance to the results of operations and cash flows of the Companies cannot be determined until their assessment process is complete.
In November 2015, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companies have adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for the period ended December31, 2015. For prior periods, the Companies have presented deferred taxes in either the current or noncurrent sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the related financial accounting assets or liabilities, or, for items such as operating loss carryforwards, the period in which the deferred taxes were expected to reverse.
In January 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. Most notably the update revises the accounting for equity securities, except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, by requiring equity securities to be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may measure equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment, if any, plus changes from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The guidance also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values, revises the presentation of financial assets and liabilities and amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The guidance is effective for the Companies interim and annual reporting periods beginning January1, 2018, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet. Amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values are to be applied prospectively to such investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Companies are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on their consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued revised accounting guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements. The update requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases while also refining the definition of a lease. In addition, lessees will be required to disclose key information about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for the Companies interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019, although it can be early adopted, with a modified retrospective approach for leases that commenced prior to the date of adoption. The Companies are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on their consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
88 Table of Contents N OTE 3. A CQUISITIONS AND D ISPOSITIONS D OMINION P ROPOSED A CQUISITION OF Q UESTAR Pursuant to the terms of the Questar Combination announced in February 2016, upon closing, each share of Questar common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing will be converted automatically into the right to receive $25 in cash per share, or approximately $4.4 billion in total. In addition, Questars debt, which currently totals approximately $1.6 billion is expected to remain outstanding. Additionally, Dominion entered into agreements with several of its lending banks pursuant to whichthey have committed to provide temporary debt financing consisting of a $3.9 billion acquisition facility. Dominion intends to permanently finance the transaction in a manner that supports its existing credit ratings targets by issuing a combination of common stock, mandatory convertibles (including RSNs) and debt at Dominion, and indirectly through an issuance of common units at Dominion Midstream, the proceeds of which will be applied to pay Dominion for certain assets of Questar, which are expected to be contributed to Dominion Midstream.
The transaction requires approval of Questars shareholders and clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Questar and Dominion also will file for review and approval, as required, from the Utah Public Service Commission and the Wyoming Public Service Commission, and provide information regarding the transaction to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission. In February 2016, the Federal Trade Commission granted antitrust approval of the Questar Combination under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Questar Combination contains certain termination rights for both Dominion and Questar, and provides that, upon termination of the Questar Combination under specified circumstances, Dominion would be required to pay a termination fee of $154 million to Questar and Questar would be required to pay Dominion a termination fee of $99 million. Subject to receipt of Questar shareholder and any required regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions, Dominion targets closing by the end of 2016.

Sale of Interest in Merchant Solar Projects In September 2015, Dominion signed an agreement to sell a noncontrolling interest (consisting of 33% of the equity interests) in all of its then currently wholly-owned merchant solar projects, 24 solar projects totaling approximately 425 MW, to SunEdison for approximately $300 million. In December 2015, the sale of interest in 15 of the solar projects closed for $184 million with the sale of interest in the remaining projects completed in January 2016. SunEdison subsequently sold its interest in these projects to Terra Nova Renewable Partners. SunEdison has a future option to buy all or a portion of Dominions remaining 67% ownership in the projects upon the occurrence of certain events, none of which had occurred as of December31, 2015 nor are expected to occur in 2016.
89 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued N ON -W HOLLY -O WNED M ERCHANT S OLAR P ROJECTS Acquisitions of Four Brothers and Three Cedars In June 2015, Dominion acquired 50% of the units in Four Brothers from SunEdison for $64 million of consideration, consisting of $2 million in cash and a $62 million payable. As of December31, 2015, a $43 million payable is included in other current liabilities in Dominions Consolidated Balance Sheets. Four Brothers purpose is to develop and operate four solar projects located in Utah, which will produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The projects are expected to cost approximately $730 million to construct, including the initial acquisition cost. Dominion is obligated to contribute $445 million of capital to fund the construction of the projects and had contributed $138 million through December 31, 2015. The facilities are expected to begin commercial operations in the third quarter of 2016, generating approximately 320 MW.
In September 2015, Dominion acquired 50% of the units in Three Cedars from SunEdison for $43 million of consideration, consisting of $6 million in cash and a $37 million payable. As of December31, 2015, a $29 million payable is included in other current liabilities in Dominions Consolidated Balance Sheets. Three Cedars purpose is to develop and operate three solar projects located in Utah, which will produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The projects are expected to cost approximately $425 million to construct. Dominion is obligated to contribute $276 million of capital to fund the construction of the projects and had contributed $60 million through December31, 2015. The facilities are expected to begin commercial operations in the third quarter of 2016, generating approximately 210 MW.
Long-term power purchase, interconnection and operation and maintenance agreements have been executed for both Four Brothers and Three Cedars. Dominion expects to claim 99% of the federal investment tax credits on the projects.
Dominion owns 50% of the voting interests in Four Brothers and Three Cedars and has a controlling financial interest over the entities through its rights to control operations. The allocation of the $64 million purchase price for Four Brothers resulted in $89 million of property, plant and equipment and $25 million of noncontrolling interest. The allocation of the $43 million purchase price for Three Cedars resulted in $65 million of property, plant and equipment and $22 million of noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest for each entity was measured at fair value using the discounted cash flow method, with the primary components of the valuation being future cash flows (both incoming and outgoing) and the discount rate. Dominion determined its discount rate based on the cost of capital a utility-scale investor would expect, as well as the cost of capital an individual project developer could achieve via a combination of non-recourse project financing and outside equity partners. The acquired assets of Four Brothers and Three Cedars are included in the Dominion Generation operating segment.
Four Brothers and Three Cedars have entered into agreements with SunEdison to provide administrative and support services in connection with the construction of the projects, operation and maintenance of the facilities, and administrative and technical management services of the solar facilities. In addition, Dominion has entered into contracts with SunEdison to provide services related to construction project management and oversight. Costs related to services to be provided under these agreements were immaterial for the year ended December31, 2015. Subsequent to Dominions acquisition of Four Brothers and Three Cedars through December 31, 2015, SunEdison made contributions to Four Brothers and Three Cedars of $103 million in aggregate, which are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In December 2015, SunEdison entered an agreement to sell its interest in Four Brothers and Three Cedars through the sale of Four Brothers Holdings, LLC, Granite Mountain Renewables, LLC and Iron Springs Renewables, LLC to DESRI.
D OMINION M IDSTREAM A CQUISITION OF I NTEREST IN I ROQUOIS In September 2015, Dominion Midstream acquired from NG and NJNR a 25.93% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, which owns and operates a 416-mile, FERC-regulated natural gas transmission pipeline in New York and Connecticut. In exchange for this partnership interest, Dominion Midstream issued 8.6million common units representing limited partnership interests in Dominion Midstream (6.8million common units to NG for its 20.4% interest and 1.8million common units to NJNR for its 5.53% interest). The investment was recorded at $216 million based on the value of Dominion Midstreams common units at closing. These common units are reflected as noncontrolling interest in Dominions Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion Midstreams noncontrolling partnership interest is reflected in the Dominion Energy operating segment. In addition to this acquisition, Dominion Gas currently holds a 24.72% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois. Dominion Midstream and Dominion Gas each account for their interest in Iroquois as an equity method investment. See Notes 9 and 15 for more information regarding Iroquois.
A CQUISITION OF DCG In January 2015, Dominion completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of DCG from SCANA Corporation for $497 million in cash, as adjusted for working capital. DCG owns and operates nearly 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia. This acquisition supports Dominions natural gas expansion into the southeastern U.S. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in $277 million of net property, plant and equipment, $250 million of goodwill, of which approximately $225 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, and $38 million of regulatory liabilities. The goodwill reflects the value associated with enhancing Dominions regulated gas position, economic value attributable to future expansion projects as well as increased opportunities for synergies. The acquired assets of DCG are included in the Dominion Energy operating segment.
On March24, 2015, DCG converted to a limited liability company under the laws of South Carolina and changed its name from Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation to DCG. On April1, 2015, Dominion contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of DCG to Dominion Midstream in exchange for total consideration of $501 million, as adjusted for working capital. Total consideration to Dominion consisted of the issuance of a two-year, $301 million senior 90 Table of Contents unsecured promissory note payable by Dominion Midstream at an annual interest rate of 0.6%, and 5,112,139 common units, valued at $200 million, representing limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream. The number of units was based on the volume weighted average trading price of Dominion Midstreams common units for the ten trading days prior to April1, 2015, or $39.12 per unit. Since Dominion consolidates Dominion Midstream for financial reporting purposes, this transaction was eliminated upon consolidation and did not impact Dominions financial position or cash flows.
S ALE OF E LECTRIC R ETAIL E NERGY M ARKETING B USINESS In March 2014, Dominion completed the sale of its electric retail energy marketing business. The proceeds were $187 million, net of transaction costs. The sale resulted in a gain, subject to post-closing adjustments, of $100 million ($57 million after-tax) net of a $31 million write-off of goodwill, and is included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominions Consolidated Statements of Income. The sale of the electric retail energy marketing business did not qualify for discontinued operations classification.
S ALE OF I LLINOIS G AS C ONTRACTS In June 2013, Dominion completed the sale of Illinois Gas Contracts. The sales price was $32 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. The sale resulted in a gain of $29 million ($18 million after-tax) net of a $3 million write-off of goodwill, and is included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominions Consolidated Statement of Income. The sale of Illinois Gas Contracts did not qualify for discontinued operations classification as it is not considered a component under applicable accounting guidance.
S ALE OF B RAYTON P OINT , K INCAID AND E QUITY M ETHOD I NVESTMENT IN E LWOOD In March 2013, Dominion entered into an agreement with Energy Capital Partners to sell Brayton Point, Kincaid, and its equity method investment in Elwood.
In the first and second quarters of 2013, Brayton Points and Kincaids assets and liabilities to be disposed were classified as held for sale and adjusted to their estimated fair value less cost to sell, resulting in impairment charges totaling $48 million ($28 million after-tax), which are included in discontinued operations in Dominions Consolidated Statements of Income. In both periods, Dominion used the market approach to estimate the fair value of Brayton Points and Kincaids long-lived assets. These were considered Level 2 fair value measurements given that they were based on the agreed-upon sales price.
Dominions 50% interest in Elwood was an equity method investment and therefore, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the carrying amount of this investment was not classified as held for sale nor were the equity earnings from this investment reported as discontinued operations.
In August 2013, Dominion completed the sale and received proceeds of $465 million, net of transaction costs. The sale resulted in a $35 million ($25 million after-tax) gain attributable to its equity method investment in Elwood, which is included in other income in Dominions Consolidated Statement of Income, which was partially offset by a $17 million ($18 million after-tax) loss attributable to Brayton Point and Kincaid, which includes a $16 million write-off of goodwill and is reflected in loss from discontinued operations in Dominions Consolidated Statement of Income.
The following table presents selected information regarding the results of operations of Brayton Point and Kincaid, which are reported as discontinued operations in Dominions Consolidated Statements of Income: Year Ended December31, 2013 (millions) Operating revenue $ 304 Loss before income taxes (135 ) (1) (1) Includes $64 million of charges related to the defeasance of Brayton Point debt and the early redemption of Kincaid debt in 2013.
Virginia Power A CQUISITION OF S OLAR P ROJECT In December 2015, Virginia Power completed the acquisition of 100% of a solar development project in North Carolina from Morgans Corner for $47 million, all of which was allocated to property, plant and equipment. The project was placed into service in December 2015 with a total cost of $49 million, including the initial acquisition cost. The project generates approximately 20 MW. The output generated by the project will be used to meet a ten year non-jurisdictional supply agreement with the U.S. Navy, which has the unilateral option to extend for an additional ten years. In October 2015, the North Carolina Commission granted the transfer of the existing CPCN from Morgans Corner to Virginia Power. The acquired asset is included in the Virginia Power Generation operating segment.

I NCOME T AXES Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. The Companies are routinely audited by federal and state tax authorities. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.
In December 2015, U.S. federal legislation was enacted, providing an extension of the 50% bonus depreciation allowance for qualifying expenditures incurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and a phasing down of the allowance to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019 and expiration thereafter. In addition, the legislation extends the 30% investment tax credit for qualifying expenditures incurred through 2019 and provides a phase down of the credit to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021 and 10% in 2022 and thereafter. U.S. federal legislation had also been enacted in December 2014 to delay the expiration of the bonus depreciation allowance, but only for one year, so that it was available for qualifying expenditures incurred during 2014.

A valuation allowance on $1.1 billion of these carryforwards has been established;  State minimum tax credits of $145 million that do not expire; and  State investment tax credits of $40 million that expire if unutilized during the period 2019 through 2024.
At December31,2015, Virginia Power had the following deductible loss and credit carryforwards:  Federal loss carryforwards of $7 million that expire if unutilized during the period 2031 through 2034;  Federal investment, production and other tax credits of $38 million that expire if unutilized during the period 2031 through 2035; and  State investment tax credits of $9 million that expire if unutilized by 2024.

93 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued A reconciliation of changes in the Companies unrecognized tax benefits follows: Dominion Virginia Power Dominion Gas 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 (millions) Balance at January1 $ 145 $ 222 $ 293 $ 36 $ 39 $ 57 $ 29 $ 29 $ 30 Increases-prior period positions 2 24 17  2 12    Decreases-prior period positions (40 ) (26 ) (99 ) (25 ) (16 ) (42 )   (1 ) Increases-current period positions 8 16 30 1 11 14    Decreases-current period positions   (5 )       Settlements with tax authorities (5 )  (2 )   (2 )    Expiration of statutes of limitations (7 ) (91 ) (12 )       Balance at December31 $ 103 $ 145 $ 222 $ 12 $ 36 $ 39 $ 29 $ 29 $ 29 Certain unrecognized tax benefits, or portions thereof, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations. For Dominion and its subsidiaries, these unrecognized tax benefits were $69 million, $77 million and $126 million at December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For Dominion, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits decreased income tax expense by $6 million, $47 million and $29 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For Virginia Power, these unrecognized tax benefits were $8 million at December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. For Virginia Power, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits affected income tax expense by less than $1 million in both 2015 and 2014, and increased income tax expense by $4 million in 2013. For Dominion Gas, these unrecognized tax benefits were $19 million at December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. For Dominion Gas, the change in these unrecognized tax benefits affected income tax expense by less than $1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
The IRS examination of tax years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 concluded in late 2013, resulting in a payment of $46 million, and an adjustment to a refund previously received by Dominion for its carryback of 2008 losses to 2007. The loss carryback, as adjusted, was submitted to the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for review. Early in 2014, Dominion received notification that the matter had been resolved with no further adjustments.
Effective for its 2014 tax year, Dominion was accepted into the CAP. Through the CAP, Dominion has the opportunity to resolve complex tax matters with the IRS before filing its federal income tax returns, thus achieving certainty for such tax return filing positions agreed to by the IRS. Under a Pre-CAP plan, the IRS audit of tax years 2012 and 2013 began in early 2014 and concluded in late 2015. The IRS audit of CAP tax year 2014 also began in 2014. The IRS issued a partial acceptance letter in late 2015 and completed its post-filing review of the 2014 tax year in early 2016. The IRS audit of CAP tax year 2015 began in 2015. Accordingly, Dominions earliest tax year remaining open for federal examination is 2015.
It is reasonably possible that settlement negotiations and expiration of statutes of limitations could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in 2016 by up to $30 million for Dominion and $22 million for Dominion Gas. If such changes were to occur, other than revisions of the accrual for interest on tax underpayments and overpayments, earnings could increase by up to $15 million for Dominion and $10 million for Dominion Gas.
Otherwise, with regard to 2015 and prior years, Dominion and Dominion Gas cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes to unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in 2016.
After considering the possibility of potential changes in the status of its remaining unrecognized tax benefits, Virginia Power has concluded that no significant changes are reasonably possible to occur in 2016.
For each of the major states in which Dominion operates, the earliest tax year remaining open for examination is as follows: State Earliest OpenTax Year Pennsylvania (1) 2010 Connecticut 2012 Virginia (2) 2012 West Virginia (1) 2012 New York (1) 2007 (1) Considered a major state for Dominion Gas operations.
(2) Considered a major state for Virginia Powers operations.
The Companies are also obligated to report adjustments resulting from IRS settlements to state tax authorities. In addition, if Dominion utilizes operating losses or tax credits generated in years for which the statute of limitations has expired, such amounts are generally subject to examination.
Discontinued Operations Details of income tax expense for Dominions discontinued operations were as follows: Year Ended December31, 2013 (millions) Current: Federal $ (274 ) State (41 ) Total current benefit (315 ) Deferred: Federal 232 State 40 Total deferred expense 272 Total income tax benefit $ (43 ) 94 Table of Contents Dominions effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the impact of goodwill written off in the sale of Kincaid and Brayton Point that is not deductible for tax purposes.
N OTE 6. F AIR V ALUE M EASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. However, the use of a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid and ask prices) is permitted. Fair values are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in valuation techniques and the inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements but also the impact of the Companies own nonperformance risk on their liabilities. Fair value measurements assume that the transaction occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability (the market with the most volume and activity for the asset or liability from the perspective of the reporting entity), or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (the market in which the reporting entity would be able to maximize the amount received or minimize the amount paid). Dominion and Virginia Power apply fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, and nuclear decommissioning trust and other investments including those held in Dominions rabbi, pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements described above. Dominion Gas applies fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities including commodity and interest rate derivative instruments and investments held in pension and other postretirement benefit plan trusts, in accordance with the requirements described above. The Companies apply credit adjustments to their derivative fair values in accordance with the requirements described above. These credit adjustments are currently not material to the derivative fair values.
Inputs and Assumptions The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, price information is sought from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and certain statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions.
The Companies commodity derivative valuations are prepared by Dominions ERM department. The ERM department creates daily mark-to-market valuations for the Companies derivative transactions using computer-based statistical models. The inputs that go into the market valuations are transactional information stored in the systems of record and market pricing information that resides in data warehouse databases. The majority of forward prices are automatically uploaded into the data warehouse databases from various third-party sources. Inputs obtained from third-party sources are evaluated for reliability considering the reputation, independence, market presence, and methodology used by the third-party. If forward prices are not available from third-party sources, then the ERM department models the forward prices based on other available market data. A team consisting of risk management and risk quantitative analysts meets each business day to assess the validity of market prices and mark-to-market valuations. During this meeting, the changes in mark-to-market valuations from period to period are examined and qualified against historical expectations. If any discrepancies are identified during this process, the mark-to-market valuations or the market pricing information is evaluated further and adjusted, if necessary.
For options and contracts with option-like characteristics where observable pricing information is not available from external sources, Dominion and Virginia Power generally use a modified Black-Scholes Model that considers time value, the volatility of the underlying commodities and other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. Dominion and Virginia Power use other option models under special circumstances, including a Spread Approximation Model when contracts include different commodities or commodity locations and a Swing Option Model when contracts allow either the buyer or seller the ability to exercise within a range of quantities. For contracts with unique characteristics, the Companies may estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow approach deemed appropriate in the circumstances and applied consistently from period to period. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a significant effect on the contracts estimated fair value.
The inputs and assumptions used in measuring fair value include the following: For commodity derivative contracts:  Forward commodity prices  Transaction prices  Price volatility  Price correlation  Volumes  Commodity location  Interest rates  Credit quality of counterparties and the Companies  Credit enhancements  Time value 95 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued For interest rate derivative contracts:  Interest rate curves  Credit quality of counterparties and the Companies  Volumes  Credit enhancements  Time value For investments:  Quoted securities prices and indices  Securities trading information including volume and restrictions  Maturity  Interest rates  Credit quality  NAV (for alternative investments and common/collective trust funds) The Companies regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to estimate fair value by a number of methods, including review and verification of models, as well as various market price verification procedures such as the use of pricing services and multiple broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities and investments in which the Companies transact.
Levels The Companies also utilize the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:  Level 1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that they have the ability to access at the measurement date. Instruments categorized in Level 1 primarily consist of financial instruments such as certain exchange-traded derivatives, and exchange-listed equities, mutual funds and certain Treasury securities held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for Dominion and Virginia Power, benefit plan trust funds for Dominion and Dominion Gas, and rabbi trust funds for Dominion.
Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Instruments categorized in Level 2 primarily include commodity forwards and swaps, interest rate swaps, restricted cash equivalents, and certain Treasury securities, money market funds, common/collective trust funds, and corporate, state and municipal debt securities held in nuclear decommissioning trust funds for Dominion and Virginia Power, benefit plan trust funds for Dominion and Dominion Gas, and rabbi trust funds for Dominion.
Level 3Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Instruments categorized in Level 3 for the Companies consist of long-dated commodity derivatives, FTRs, natural gas peaking options and other modeled commodity derivatives. Additional instruments categorized in Level 3 for Dominion and Dominion Gas include alternative investments, consisting of investments in partnerships, joint ventures and other alternative investments, held in benefit plan trust funds.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
For derivative contracts, the Companies recognize transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 based on fair values as of the first day of the month in which the transfer occurs. Transfers out of Level3 represent assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level3 for which the inputs became observable for classification in either Level1 or Level2. Because the activity and liquidity of commodity markets vary substantially between regions and time periods, the availability of observable inputs for substantially the full term and value of the Companies over-the-counter derivative contracts is subject to change.
Level 3 Valuations Fair value measurements are categorized as Level 3 when price or other inputs that are considered to be unobservable are significant to their valuations. Long-dated commodity derivatives are generally based on unobservable inputs due to the length of time to settlement and the absence of market activity and are therefore categorized as Level 3. FTRs are categorized as Level 3 fair value measurements because the only relevant pricing available comes from ISO auctions, which are generally not considered to be liquid markets. Other modeled commodity derivatives have unobservable inputs in their valuation, mostly due to non- transparent and illiquid markets. Alternative investments are categorized as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, illiquidity and the long-term nature of these assets. These investments are generally valued using NAV based on the proportionate share of the fair value as determined by reference to the most recent audited fair value financial statements or fair value statements provided by the investment manager adjusted for any significant events occurring between the investment managers and the Companies measurement date.
The Companies enter into certain physical and financial forwards, futures, options and swaps, which are considered Level 3 as they have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation. The discounted cash flow method is used to value Level 3 physical and financial forwards and futures contracts. An option model is used to value Level 3 physical and financial options. The discounted cash flow model for forwards and futures calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, risk-free rate of return, and credit spreads. The option model calculates mark-to-market valuations using variations of the Black-Scholes option model. The inputs into the models are the forward market prices, implied price volatilities, risk-free rate of return, the option expiration dates, the option strike prices, the original sales prices, 96 Table of Contents and volumes. For Level 3 fair value measurements, forward market prices, credit spreads and implied price volatilities are considered unobservable. The unobservable inputs are developed and substantiated using historical information, available market data, third-party data, and statistical analysis. Periodically, inputs to valuation models are reviewed and revised as needed, based on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and relationships, and changes in third-party pricing sources.
The following table presents Dominions quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements at December31, 2015. The range and weighted average are presented in dollars for market price inputs and percentages for price volatility and credit spreads.

D OMINION G AS Natural Gas Assets In the fourth quarter of 2014, Dominion Gas recorded an impairment charge of $9 million ($6 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income, to write off previously capitalized costs following the cancellation of a development project.
In June 2013, Dominion Gas purchased certain natural gas infrastructure facilities that were previously leased from third parties. The purchase price was based on terms in the lease, which exceeded current market pricing.As a result of the purchase price and expected losses, Dominion Gas recorded an impairment charge of $49 million ($29 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income, to write down the long-lived assets to their estimated fair values of less than $1 million. As management was not aware of any recent market transactions for comparable assets with sufficient transparency to develop a market approach to fair value, Dominion Gas used the income approach (discounted cash flows) to estimate the fair value of the assets in this impairment test. This was considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, including estimates of future production and other commodity prices.
97 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued Also in June 2013, Dominion Gas recorded an impairment charge of $6 million ($4 million after-tax) in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income, to write off previously capitalized costs following the cancellation of two development projects.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Substantially all of the Companies financial instruments are recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below, which are reported at historical cost. Estimated fair values have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash (which is recorded in other current assets), customer and other receivables, short-term debt, affiliated current borrowings, payables to affiliates and accounts payable are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For the Companies financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows: At December31, 2015 2014 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (1) Carrying Amount Estimated FairValue (1) (millions) Dominion Long-term debt, including securities due within one year (2) $ 21,998 $ 23,210 $ 19,723 $ 21,881 Junior subordinated notes (3) 1,358 1,192 1,374 1,396 Remarketable subordinated notes (3) 2,086 2,129 2,083 2,362 Virginia Power Long-term debt, including securities due within one year (3) $ 9,425 $ 10,400 $ 8,937 $ 10,293 Dominion Gas Long-term debt, including securities due within one year (3) $ 3,292 $ 3,299 $ 2,594 $ 2,672 (1) Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. All fair value measurements are classified as Level 2. The carrying amount of debt issues with short-term maturities and variable rates refinanced at current market rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.
(2) Carrying amount includes amounts which represent the unamortized discount and/or premium. At December31,2015, and 2014, includes the valuation of certain fair value hedges associated with Dominions fixed rate debt, of $7 million and $19 million, respectively.
(3) Carrying amount includes amounts which represent the unamortized discount and/or premium.
102 Table of Contents N OTE 7. D ERIVATIVES A ND H EDGE A CCOUNTING A CTIVITIES The Companies are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products they market and purchase, as well as interest rate risks of their business operations. The Companies use derivative instruments to manage exposure to these risks, and designate certain derivative instruments as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. As discussed in Note 2, for jurisdictions subject to cost-based rate regulation, changes in the fair value of derivatives are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until the related transactions impact earnings. See Note 6 for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives.
Derivative assets and liabilities are presented gross on the Companies Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dominions derivative contracts include both over-the-counter transactions and those that are executed on an exchange or other trading platform (exchange contracts) and centrally cleared. Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas derivative contracts include over-the-counter transactions. Over-the-counter contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange, or clearinghouse to enter, execute, or clear the transactions. Certain over-the-counter and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of setoff through master netting arrangements, derivative clearing agreements, and contract default provisions. In addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of setoff through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency, or other conditions.
In general, most over-the-counter transactions and all exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral for over-the-counter and exchange contracts include cash, letters of credit, and other forms of security, none of which are subject to restrictions. Cash collateral is used in the table below to offset derivative assets and liabilities. Certain accounts receivable and accounts payable recognized on the Companies Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as letters of credit and other forms of security, all of which are not included in the tables below, are subject to offset under master netting or similar arrangements and would reduce the net exposure.

Dominion A TLANTIC C OAST P IPELINE In September 2014, Dominion, along with Duke Energy, Piedmont and AGL, announced the formation of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The members, which are subsidiaries of the above-referenced parent companies, hold the following membership interests: Dominion, 45%; Duke Energy, 40%; Piedmont, 10%; and AGL, 5%. In October2015, Duke Energy entered into a merger agreement with Piedmont. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline partnership agreement includes provisions to allow Dominion an option to purchase additional ownership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline to maintain a leading ownership percentage. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina. Subsidiaries and affiliates of all four members plan to be customers of the pipeline under 20-year contracts. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. also plans to be a customer of the pipeline under a 20-year contract. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is considered an equity method investment as Dominion has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. See Note 15 for more information.

Assignments of Shale Development Rights In December 2013, Dominion Gas closed on agreements with two natural gas producers to convey over time approximately 100,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath several of its natural gas storage fields. The agreements provide for payments to Dominion Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of approximately $200 million over a period of nine years, and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. In 2013, Dominion Gas received approximately $100 million in cash proceeds, resulting in a $20 million ($12 million after-tax) gain, recorded to operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2014, Dominion Gas received $16 million in additional cash proceeds resulting from post-closing adjustments. At December31, 2014, deferred revenue totaled $85 million. In March 2015, Dominion Gas and one of the natural gas producers closed on an amendment to the agreement, which included the immediate conveyance of approximately 9,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights and a two-year extension of the term of the original agreement. The conveyance of development rights resulted in the recognition of $43 million ($27 million after-tax) of previously deferred revenue to operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas Consolidated Statements of Income. At December31, 2015, deferred revenue totaled $37 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement.
In November 2014, Dominion Gas closed an agreement with a natural gas producer to convey over time approximately 24,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. The agreement provides for payments to Dominion Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of approx- 116 Table of Contents imately $120 million over a period of four years, and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage.

In March 2015, Dominion Gas conveyed to a natural gas producer approximately 11,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields and received proceeds of $27 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. This transaction resulted in a $27 million ($16 million after-tax) gain, included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas Consolidated Statements of Income.
In September 2015, Dominion Gas closed on an agreement with a natural gas producer to convey approximately 16,000 acres of Utica and Point Pleasant Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. The agreement provided for a payment to Dominion Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of $52 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. In September 2015, Dominion Gas received proceeds of $52 million associated with the conveyance of the acreage, resulting in a $52 million ($29 million after-tax) gain, included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas Consolidated Statements of Income.

The majority of these expenditures are expected to be recovered within the next two years.
N OTE 13. R EGULATORY M ATTERS Regulatory Matters Involving Potential Loss Contingencies As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in various regulatory matters. Certain regulatory matters may ultimately result in a loss; however, as such matters are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending reviews or orders, and/or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For matters for which the Companies cannot estimate a range of possible loss, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the regulatory process such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For regulatory matters for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any estimated range is based on currently available information, involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties and may not represent the Companies maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such regulatory matters will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current matters not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the outcome from such matters would have a material effect on the Companies financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
FERCE LECTRIC Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Dominions merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO, CAISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the states of Tennessee, Georgia, California and Utah, under Dominions market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC. Virginia Power purchases and, under its FERC market-based rate authority, sells electricity in the wholesale market. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Powers service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.
Rates In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Powers electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.
In March 2010, ODEC and North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation filed a complaint with FERC against Virginia Power claiming that $223 million in transmission costs related to specific projects were unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential and should be excluded from Virginia Powers transmission formula rate. In October 2010, FERC issued an order dismissing the complaint in part and established hearings and settlement procedures on the remaining part of the complaint.In February 2012, Virginia Power submitted to FERC a settlement agreement to resolve all issues set for hearing.The settlement was accepted by FERC in May 2012 and provides for payment by Virginia Power to the transmission customer parties collectively of $250,000 per year for ten years and resolves all matters other than allocation of the incremental cost of certain underground transmission facilities.
In March 2014, FERC issued an order excluding from Virginia Powers transmission rates for wholesale transmission customers located outside Virginia the incremental costs of undergrounding certain transmission line projects. FERC found it is not just and reasonable for non-Virginia wholesale transmission customers to be allocated the incremental costs of undergrounding the facilities because the projects are a direct result of Virginia legislation and Virginia Commission pilot programs intended to benefit the citizens of Virginia. The order is retroactively effective as of March 2010 and will cause the reallocation of the costs charged to wholesale transmission customers with loads outside Virginia to wholesale transmission customers with loads in Virginia.FERC determined that there was not sufficient evidence on the record to determine the magnitude of the underground increment and held a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of undergrounding cost to be allocated to each wholesale transmission customer in Virginia. While Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the hearing, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.
PJM Transmission Rates In April 2007, FERC issued an order regarding its transmission rate design for the allocation of costs among PJM transmission customers, including Virginia Power, for transmission service provided by PJM. For new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, FERC established a PJM regional rate design where customers pay according to each customers share of the regions load. For recovery of costs of existing facilities, FERC approved the existing methodology whereby a customer pays the cost of facilities located in the same zone as the customer. A number of parties appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
In August 2009, the court issued its decision affirming the FERC order with regard to the existing facilities, but remanded to FERC the issue of the cost allocation associated with the new facilities 500 kV and above for further consideration by FERC. On remand, FERC reaffirmed its earlier decision to allocate the costs of new facilities 500 kV and above according to the customers share of the regions load. A number of parties filed appeals of the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In June 2014, the court again remanded the cost allocation issue to FERC. In December 2014, FERC issued an order setting an evidentiary hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the cost 119 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued allocation issue. The hearing only concerns the costs of new facilities approved by PJM prior to February1, 2013. Transmission facilities approved after February1, 2013 are allocated on a hybrid cost allocation method approved by FERC and not subject to any court review.
Virginia Power expects that a settlement agreement will be executed regarding this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, Virginia Power would be required to pay $200 million to PJM over the next 10 years. Although no FERC order has been issued and the expected settlement agreement has not been filed and accepted by FERC, Virginia Power believes it is probable it will be required to make payment as an outcome of the hearing and settlement proceedings. Accordingly, as of December31, 2015, Virginia Power has recorded a contingent liability of $200 million in other deferred credits and other liabilities, which is offset by a $192 million regulatory asset for the amount that will be recovered through retail rates in Virginia. The remaining $8 million was recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Other Regulatory Matters E LECTRIC R EGULATION IN V IRGINIA The Regulation Act enacted in 2007 instituted a cost-of-service rate model, ending Virginias planned transition to retail competition for electric supply service to most classes of customers.
The Regulation Act authorizes stand-alone rate adjustment clauses for recovery of costs for new generation projects, FERC-approved transmission costs, underground distribution lines, environmental compliance, conservation and energy efficiency programs and renewable energy programs, and also contains statutory provisions directing Virginia Power to file annual fuel cost recovery cases with the Virginia Commission. As amended, it provides for enhanced returns on capital expenditures on specific newly-proposed generation projects.
If the Virginia Commissions future rate decisions, including actions relating to Virginia Powers rate adjustment clause filings, differ materially from Virginia Powers expectations, it may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Regulation Act Legislation In February 2015, the Virginia Governor signed legislation into law which will keep Virginia Powers base rates unchanged until at least December1, 2022. In addition, no biennial reviews will be conducted by the Virginia Commission for the five successive 12-month test periods beginning January1, 2015, and ending December31, 2019. The legislation states that Virginia Powers 2015 biennial review, filed in March 2015, would proceed for the sole purpose of reviewing and determining whether any refunds are due to customers based on earnings performance for generation and distribution services during the 2013 and 2014 test periods. In addition the legislation requires the Virginia Commission to conduct proceedings in 2017 and 2019 to determine the utilitys ROE for use in connection with rate adjustment clauses and requires utilities to file integrated resource plans annually rather than biennially. However, in November 2015, the Virginia Commission ordered testimony, briefs and separate bifurcated hearing in Virginia Powers currently pending Rider B, Rider R, Rider S and Rider W cases on whether the Virginia Commission can adjust the ROE applicable to these rate adjustment clauses prior to 2017. The legislation also required Virginia Power to write-off $85 million of prior-period deferred fuel costs during the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the legislation required the Virginia Commission to implement a fuel rate reduction for Virginia Power as soon as practicable based on this non-recovery as well as any over-recovery for the 2014-2015 fuel year and projected fuel expense for the 2015-2016 fuel year. The legislation also deems the construction or purchase of one or more utility-scale solar facilities located in Virginia up to 500 MW in total to be in the public interest.
2015 Biennial Review Pursuant to the Regulation Act, in March 2015, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and schedules for the Virginia Commissions 2015 biennial review of Virginia Powers rates, terms and conditions. Per legislation enacted in February 2015, this biennial review was limited to reviewing Virginia Powers earnings on rates for generation and distribution services for the combined 2013 and 2014 test period, and determining whether credits are due to customers in the event Virginia Powers earnings exceeded the earnings band determined in the 2013 Biennial Review Order. In November 2015, the Virginia Commission issued the 2015 Biennial Review Order.
After deciding several contested regulatory earnings adjustments, the Virginia Commission ruled that Virginia Power earned on average an ROE of approximately 10.89% on its generation and distribution services for the combined 2013 and 2014 test periods. Because this ROE was more than 70 basis points above Virginia Powers authorized ROE of 10.0%, the Virginia Commission ordered that approximately $20 million in excess earnings be credited to customer bills based on usage in 2013 and 2014 over a six-month period beginning within 60 days of the 2015 Biennial Review Order. Based upon 2015 legislation keeping Virginia Powers base rates unchanged until at least December1, 2022, the Virginia Commission did not order certain existing rate adjustment clauses to be combined with Virginia Powers base rates. The Virginia Commission did not determine whether Virginia Power had a revenue deficiency or sufficiency when projecting the annual revenues generated by base rates to the revenues required to recover costs of service and earn a fair return. In December 2015, a group of large industrial customers filed notices of appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia from both the 2015 Biennial Review Order and the Virginia Commissions order denying their petition for rehearing or reconsideration. This appeal is pending.
Virginia Fuel Expenses In February 2015, Virginia Power submitted its annual fuel factor filing to the Virginia Commission. In August 2015, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Powers annual fuel factor filing to recover an estimated $1.6 billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expenses for the rate year beginning July1, 2015. Virginia Powers new approved fuel rate, in effect on an interim basis since April1, 2015, represents a fuel revenue decrease of $512 million when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for the period April1, 2015 to June30, 2016.
120 Table of Contents Solar Facility Projects In January 2015, Virginia Power applied for a CPCN to construct and operate a 20 MW utility-scale solar facility near its existing Remington power station in Fauquier County, Virginia.The total estimated cost of the Remington solar facility was approximately $47 million, excluding financing costs. Virginia Power also applied for approval of Rider US-1 to recover the projected costs of the facility.In October 2015, the Virginia Commission denied approval of the CPCN and Rider US-1 based on the evidence in the record but stated that an application could be re-filed to address the concerns cited by the Virginia Commission.Virginia Power is assessing its options for re-filing.
In October 2015, Virginia Power filed a CPCN with the Virginia Commission to construct three solar facilities. Woodland, Scott Solar and Whitehouse would increase Dominions renewable generation by a combined 56 MW and are estimated to cost approximately $130 million, excluding financing costs. Virginia Power also applied for approval of Rider US-2. This case is pending. The facilities are expected to commence commercial operations, subject to regulatory approvals, in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Rate Adjustment Clauses Below is a discussion of significant riders associated with various Virginia Power projects:  The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider T1 concerning transmission rates. In May 2015, Virginia Power proposed a $668 million total revenue requirement for the rate year beginning September1, 2015, which represents a $130 million increase over the previous year. Virginia Power also presented a mitigation proposal to defer $96 million of this revenue requirement to the rate year beginning September1, 2016, which would reduce by 50% the one-year rate impact on residential customers. In August 2015, the Virginia Commission rejected the mitigation proposal and approved full recovery of the proposed revenue requirement.
The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider S in conjunction with the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. In June 2015, Virginia Power proposed a $250 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning April1, 2016, which represents a $5 million increase over the previous year. This case is pending.
The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider W in conjunction with Warren County. In June 2015, Virginia Power proposed a $118 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning April1, 2016, which represents a $17 million decrease versus the previous year. This case is pending.
The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider R in conjunction with Bear Garden. In June 2015, Virginia Power proposed a $74 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning April1, 2016, which represents a $10 million decrease versus the previous year. This case is pending.
The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider B in conjunction with the conversion of three power stations to biomass. In June 2015, Virginia Power proposed a $30 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning April1, 2016, which represents a $21 million increase over the previous year. This case is pending.
Virginia legislation which provides for the recovery of costs to move certain electric distribution facilities underground became effective in July 2014. In October 2014, Virginia Power filed for approval of Rider U, which proposed a revenue requirement of $28 million during the initial rate year beginning September1, 2015. In May 2015, Virginia Power revised the revenue requirement to $24 million. In July 2015, the Virginia Commission denied approval of Rider U based on the evidence in the record, but found that an alternative plan addressing certain concerns, such as the lack of a cost-benefit analysis, could reasonably satisfy the regulatory requirements for approval. In December 2015, Virginia Power filed for approval of a more limitedundergrounding program, along with a revised Rider U proposing a revenue requirement of $24 million for the initial rate year beginning September1, 2016. This case is pending.
The Virginia Commission previously approved Riders C1A and C2A in connection with cost recovery for DSM programs.In August 2015, Virginia Power proposed a total revenue requirement of $50 million for the rate year beginning May1, 2016.Virginia Power further proposed two new energy efficiency programs for Virginia Commission approval with a requested five-year cost cap of $51 million for those programs, and to extend an existing peak-shaving program for an additional five years under current funding.This case is pending.
The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider BW in conjunction with Brunswick County. In October 2015, Virginia Power proposed a $156 million total revenue requirement for the rate year beginning September1, 2016, which represents a $45 million increase versus the previous year. This case is pending.
In July 2015, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to construct and operate Greensville County and related transmission interconnection facilities.Virginia Power also applied for approval of Rider GV to recover the costs of Greensville County, and proposed a total revenue requirement of $42 million for the rate year beginning April1, 2016. This case is pending.
Electric Transmission Projects In November 2013, the Virginia Commission issued an order granting Virginia Power a CPCN to construct approximately 7 miles of new overhead 500 kV transmission line from the existing Surry switching station in Surry County to a new Skiffes Creek switching station in James City County, and approximately 20 miles of new 230 kV transmission line in James City County, York County, and the City of Newport News from the proposed new Skiffes Creek switching station to Virginia Powers existing Whealton substation in the City of Hampton. In February 2014, the Virginia Commission granted reconsideration requested by Virginia Power and issued an Order Amending Certificate. Several appeals were filed with the Supreme Court of Virginia. In April 2015, the Supreme Court of Virginia issued its opinion in the consolidated appeals of the Virginia Commissions order granting a CPCN for the Skiffes Creek transmission line and related facilities. The Supreme Court of Virginia unanimously affirmed all but one of the alleged grounds for appeal. The court approved the proposed project including the proposed route for a 121 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued 500 kV overhead transmission line from Surry to the Skiffes Creek switching station site. The court reversed and remanded the Virginia Commissions determination in one set of appeals that the Skiffes Creek switching station was a transmission line for purposes of statutory exemption from local zoning ordinances. In May 2015, the Supreme Court of Virginia denied separate petitions filed by Virginia Power and the Virginia Commission to rehear its ruling regarding the Skiffes Creek switching station. Pending receipt of remaining required permits and approvals, Virginia Power expects to construct the project.
In May 2015, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to construct and operate in Loudoun County, Virginia, a new approximately 230 kV Poland Road substation, and a new approximately four mile overhead 230 kV double circuit transmission line between the existing 230 kV Loudoun-Brambleton line and the Poland Road substation. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $55 million. This case is pending.
In November 2015, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to convert an existing transmission line to 230 kV in Prince William County, Virginia, and Loudoun County, Virginia, and to construct and operate a new approximately five mile overhead 230 kV double circuit transmission line between a tap point near the Gainesville substation and a new to-be-constructed Haymarket substation. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $51 million. This case is pending.
In November 2015, Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to construct and operate in multiple Virginia counties an approximately 38 mile overhead 230 kV transmission line between the Remington and Gordonsville substations, along with associated facilities. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $104 million. This case is pending.
In February 2016, the Virginia Commission issued an order granting Virginia Power a CPCN to construct and operate the Remington CT-Warrenton 230 kV double circuit transmission line, the Vint Hill-Wheeler and Wheeler-Gainesville 230 kV lines and the 230 kV Vint Hill and Wheeler switching stations along Virginia Powers proposed route. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $105 million.
North Anna Virginia Power is considering the construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna. If Virginia Power decides to build a new unit, it must first receive a COL from the NRC, approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental permits and other approvals. The COL is expected in 2017. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna.
The motions and petitions filed by BREDL prior to April 2015 have been dismissed, and under a previous ruling of the NRC, the contested portion of the COL proceeding remains terminated. The NRC is required to conduct a hearing in all COL proceedings, and if a new contention is not admitted, the mandatory NRC hearing will be uncontested.
In April 2015, BREDL filed a new motion and petition seeking to object to the NRCs reliance on the continued storage rule in licensing proceedings. The BREDL filings are substantially the same as those filed in other COL proceedings in which final environmental impact statements were issued prior to promulgation of the continued storage rule, like North Anna 3. In June 2015, the NRC denied the April 2015 motion and petition.
In August 2015, BREDL filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit seeking review of the NRCs June 2015 decision. Along with the petition for judicial review, BREDL also filed a motion to hold this judicial review in abeyance pending the outcome of the ongoing judicial review of the NRCs rule pertaining to the continued onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel in litigation pending before the same court. Similar petitions were filed seeking judicial review of the NRCs decision as it applies to other COL and license renewal proceedings. Virginia Power has filed a motion with the court to intervene in the proceeding. This case is pending.
North Anna and Offshore Wind Legislation In April 2014, legislation was enacted in Virginia that permits Virginia Power to recover 70% of the costs previously deferred or capitalized related to the development of a third nuclear unit located at North Anna and offshore wind facilities through December31, 2013 as part of the 2013 and 2014 base rates. Virginia Power had deferred or capitalized costs totaling $577 million for these projects as of December31, 2013, substantially all of which relate to North Anna. For the 70% portion of these previously deferred or capitalized costs allocable to customers in Virginia, Virginia Power recognized such amounts as charges against net income beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and for the remainder of the year. During 2014, Virginia Power recognized $374 million ($248 million after-tax) in charges against income representing the cumulative recovery of costs from January 2013 through December 2014, which are primarily included in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining deferred or capitalized costs, as well as costs incurred after December31, 2013, continue to be eligible for inclusion in a future rate adjustment clause.
N ORTH C AROLINA R EGULATION In December 2012, the North Carolina Commission approved a $36 million increase in Virginia Powers annual non-fuel base revenues based on an authorized ROE of 10.2%, and a $14 million decrease in annual base fuel revenues for a combined total base revenue increase of $22 million. These rate changes became effective on January1, 2013. Following an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, the North Carolina Commission issued an opinion reaffirming its 10.2% ROE determination in July 2015.
In August 2015, Virginia Power submitted its annual filing to the North Carolina Commission to adjust the fuel component of its electric rates. Virginia Power proposed an $11 million decrease to the fuel component of its electric rates for the rate year beginning January1, 2016. This decrease includes the North Carolina Commissions previous approval to defer recovering 50% of Virginia Powers estimated $17 million jurisdictional deferred fuel balance to the 2016 fuel year, without interest. In December 2015, the North Carolina Commission approved Virginia Powers proposed fuel charge adjustment.
122 Table of Contents O HIO R EGULATION PIR Program In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at replacing approximately 25% of its pipeline system. In March 2015, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Commission requesting approval to extend the PIR program for an additional five years and to increase the annual capital investment, with corresponding increases in the annual rate-increase caps.In its application, East Ohio proposed that PIR investments for 2016 should fall under the existing authorization and that the new five-year period should include investment through December31, 2021. East Ohio also proposed that the PIR investment should be increased by $20 million in 2017 and another $20 million in 2018, bringing the total annual investment to $200 million.Thereafter, East Ohio proposed capital investment increases of 3%per year for 2019 through 2021 to mitigate inflation and other cost pressures experienced to date, which will continue into the future.This case is pending.
In February 2015, East Ohio filed an application to adjust the PIR cost recovery for 2014 costs. The filing reflects gross plant investment for 2014 of $155 million, cumulative gross plant investment of $829 million and a revenue requirement of $108 million. This application was approved by the Ohio Commission in April 2015.
AMR Program In 2007, East Ohio began installing automated meter reading technology for its 1.2million customers in Ohio. The AMR program approved by the Ohio Commission was completed in 2012. Although no further capital investment will be added, East Ohio is approved to recover depreciation, property taxes, carrying charges and a return until East Ohio has another rate case.
In February 2015, East Ohio filed its application with the Ohio Commission to adjust its AMR cost recovery charge to recover costs for calendar year 2014 associated with AMR deployment. The filing reflects a projected revenue requirement of approximately $8 million. This application was approved by the Ohio Commission in April 2015.
PIPP Plus Program Under the Ohio PIPP Plus Program, eligible customers can make reduced payments based on their ability to pay their bill. The difference between the customers total bill and the PIPP amount is deferred and collected under the PIPP Rider in accordance with the rules of the Ohio Commission. In July 2015, East Ohios annual update of the PIPP Rider was automatically approved by the Ohio Commission after a 45-day waiting period from the date of the filing.The revised rider rate reflects the refund for the twelve-month period from July 2015 through June 2016 of an over-recovery of accumulated arrearages of approximately $57 million as of March31, 2015, net of projected deferred program costs of approximately $35 million from April 2015 through June 2016.
UEX Rider East Ohio has approval for a UEX Rider through which it recovers the bad debt expense of most customers not participating in the PIPP Plus Program. The UEX Rider is adjusted annually to achieve dollar for dollar recovery of East Ohios actual write-offs of uncollectible amounts. In July 2015, the Ohio Commission approved East Ohios application to decrease its UEX Rider, which reflects a refund of over-recovered accumulated bad debt expense of $14 million as of March31, 2015, and recovery of prospective net bad debt expense projected to total approximately $20 million for the twelve-month period from April 2015 to March 2016.
PSMP In October 2015, East Ohio requested approval from the Ohio Commission to defer the operation and maintenance costs associated with implementing a proposed PSMP. The costs are not expected to exceed $15 million per year.
W EST V IRGINIA R EGULATION In September 2015, Hope requested approval of PREP from the West Virginia Commission. In the application, Hope proposed a projected capital investment for 2016 of $24 million as part of a total five-year projected capital investment of $158 million. In January 2016, Hope and the West Virginia Commission reached a settlement allowing Hope to include costs related to capital investment for 2016 of $20 million in new PREP customer rates effective March1, 2016.

The Keys Energy Project is anticipated to be placed into service in March 2017.
N OTE 14. A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS AROs represent obligations that result from laws, statutes, contracts and regulations related to the eventual retirement of certain of the Companies long-lived assets. Dominions and Virginia Powers AROs are primarily associated with the decommissioning of their nuclear generation facilities and also include those for ash pond closures and the future abatement of asbestos expected to be disturbed in their generation facilities. Dominion Gas AROs primarily include plugging and abandonment of gas and oil wells and the interim retirement of natural gas gathering, transmission, distribution and storage pipeline components.
The Companies have also identified, but not recognized, AROs related to the retirement of Dominions LNG facility, Dominion Gas storage wells in its underground natural gas storage network, certain Virginia Power electric transmission and distribution assets located on property with easements, rights of way, franchises and 123 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued lease agreements, Virginia Powers hydroelectric generation facilities and the abatement of certain asbestos not expected to be disturbed in Dominions and Virginia Powers generation facilities. The Companies currently do not have sufficient information to estimate a reasonable range of expected retirement dates for any of these assetssince the economic lives of these assets can be extended indefinitely through regular repair and maintenance and they currently have no plans to retire or dispose of any of these assets.As a result, a settlement date is not determinable for these assets and AROs for these assets will not be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements until sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the activities to be performed. The Companies continue to monitor operational and strategic developments to identify if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate a retirement date for these assets.The changes to AROs during 2014 and 2015 were as follows: Amount (millions) Dominion AROs at December31, 2013 $ 1,578 Obligations incurred during the period 40 Obligations settled during the period (82 ) Revisions in estimated cash flows (1) 102 Accretion 81 Other (5 ) AROs at December31, 2014 (2) $ 1,714 Obligations incurred during the period (3) 315 Obligations settled during the period (106 ) Revisions in estimated cash flows (3) 88 Accretion 93 Other (1 ) AROs at December31, 2015 (2) $ 2,103 Virginia Power AROs at December31, 2013 $ 689 Obligations incurred during the period 28 Obligations settled during the period (1 ) Revisions in estimated cash flows (1) 108 Accretion 37 Other (6 ) AROs at December31, 2014 $ 855 Obligations incurred during the period (3) 289 Obligations settled during the period (39 ) Revisions in estimated cash flows (3) 92 Accretion 50 AROs at December31, 2015 $ 1,247 Dominion Gas AROs at December31, 2013 $ 137 Obligations incurred during the period 2 Obligations settled during the period (8 ) Accretion 8 Other 8 AROs at December31, 2014 (4) $ 147 Obligations incurred during the period 5 Obligations settled during the period (6 ) Revisions in estimated cash flows (5 ) Accretion 9 Other (1 ) AROs at December31, 2015 (4) $ 149 (1) Relates primarily to a shift of the delayed planned date on which the DOE is expected to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel.

(4) Includes $140 million and $137 million reported in other deferred credits and other liabilities, with the remainder recorded in other current liabilities, at December31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
Dominion and Virginia Power have established trusts dedicated to funding the future decommissioning of their nuclear plants. At both December31,2015 and 2014, the aggregate fair value of Dominions trusts, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities, totaled $4.2 billion. At both December31,2015 and 2014, the aggregate fair value of Virginia Powers trusts, consisting primarily of debt and equity securities, totaled $1.9 billion.
N OTE 15. V ARIABLE I NTEREST E NTITIES The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE and to disclose certain information about its significant variable interests in the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Dominion Through August 2013, Dominion leased the Fairless generating facility in Pennsylvania, which began commercial operations in June 2004, from Juniper, the lessor. In August 2013, the lease expired and Dominion purchased Fairless for $923 million from Juniper per the terms of the lease agreement. However, as Dominion had previously consolidated Juniper, the purchase was accounted for as an equity transaction to acquire the noncontrolling interests from Juniper for $923 million, while Dominion retained control of Fairless.
Dominion has an initial 45% membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Note 9 for more details regarding the nature of this entity. Dominion concluded that Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a VIE because it has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Dominion has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly impact its economic performance, as the power to direct is shared among multiple unrelated parties. Dominion is obligated to provide capital contributions based on its ownership percentage. Dominions maximum exposure to loss is limited to its current and future investment.
Dominion and Dominion Gas Dominion Midstream and Dominion Gas own a 25.93% and 24.72% noncontrolling partnership interest in Iroquois, respectively. See Note 3 for further details regarding the nature of this entity. Dominion concluded that Iroquois is a VIE because a non-affiliated Iroquois equity holder has the ability during a limited period of time to transfer its ownership interests to another Iroquois equity holder or its affiliate. At December31, 2015, Dominion concluded that neither Dominion Midstream nor Dominion Gas is the primary beneficiary of Iroquois as they do not have the power to direct the activities of Iroquois that most significantly impact its economic performance, as the power to direct is shared among multiple unrelated parties. If Iroquois determines capital contributions are required, Dominion Midstream and Dominion Gas each would be obligated to provide the portion of capital contributions based on its ownership percentage. Dominion Midstreams and Dominion Gas maximum exposure to loss is limited to their current and future investment.
124 Table of Contents Dominion Gas DTI has been engaged to oversee the construction of, and to subsequently operate and maintain, the projects undertaken by Atlantic Coast Pipeline based on the overall direction and oversight of Atlantic Coast Pipelines members. An affiliate of DTI holds a membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, therefore DTI is considered to have a variable interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The members of Atlantic Coast Pipeline hold the power to direct the construction, operations and maintenance activities of the entity. DTI has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly impact its economic performance. DTI has no obligation to absorb any losses of the VIE. See Note 24 for information about associated related party receivable balances.
Virginia Power Virginia Power had long-term power and capacity contracts with five non-utility generators, which contain certain variable pricing mechanisms in the form of partial fuel reimbursement that Virginia Power considers to be variable interests. Contracts with two of these non-utility generators expired during 2015 leaving a remaining aggregate summer generation capacity of approximately 418 MW. After an evaluation of the information provided by these entities, Virginia Power was unable to determine whether they were VIEs. However, the information they provided, as well as Virginia Powers knowledge of generation facilities in Virginia, enabled Virginia Power to conclude that, if they were VIEs, it would not be the primary beneficiary. This conclusion reflects Virginia Powers determination that its variable interests do not convey the power to direct the most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the entities during the remaining terms of Virginia Powers contracts and for the years the entities are expected to operate after its contractual relationships expire. The remaining contracts expire at various dates ranging from 2017 to 2021. Virginia Power is not subject to any risk of loss from these potential VIEs other than its remaining purchase commitments which totaled $439 million as of December31, 2015. Virginia Power paid $200 million, $223 million, and $217 million for electric capacity and $83 million, $138 million, and $98 million for electric energy to these entities for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Virginia Power and Dominion Gas Virginia Power and Dominion Gas purchased shared services from DRS, an affiliated VIE, of $318 million and $115 million, $335 million and $106 million, and $331 million and $115 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas determined that each is not the most closely associated entity with DRS and therefore neither is the primary beneficiary. DRS provides accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to all Dominion subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas have no obligation to absorb more than their allocated shares of DRS costs.
N OTE 16. S HORT - TERM D EBT AND C REDIT A GREEMENTS The Companies use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In January 2016, Dominion expanded its short-term funding resources through a $1.0 billion increase to one of its joint revolving credit facility limits.In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominions credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.

In February 2016, Dominion issued $500 million of 2.125% senior notes in a private placement. The notes mature in 2018.
Senior Note Redemptions As part of Dominions Liability Management Exercise, in December 2014, Dominion redeemed five outstanding series of senior notes with an aggregate outstanding principal of $1.9 billion. The aggregate redemption price paid in December 2014 was $2.2 billion and represents the principal amount outstanding, accrued and unpaid interest and the applicable make-whole premium of $263million. Total charges for the Liability Management Exercise of $284 million, including the make-whole premium, were recognized and recorded in interest expense in Dominions Consolidated Statements of Income. Proceeds from Dominions issuance of senior notes in November 2014 were used to offset the payment of the redemption price. Also see Convertible Securities called for redemption below.
Convertible Securities As part of Dominions Liability Management Exercise, in November 2014, Dominion provided notice to redeem all $22 million of outstanding contingent convertible senior notes. The senior notes were eligible for conversion during 2014. However, in lieu of redemption, holders elected to convert the remaining $22 million of notes in December 2014 into $26 million of common stock. Proceeds from Dominions issuance of senior notes in November 2014 were used to offset the portion of the conversions paid in cash. At December31, 2014, all of the senior notes have been converted and none remain outstanding.
Junior Subordinated Notes Payable to Affiliated Trusts In previous years, Dominion established several subsidiary capital trusts, each as a finance subsidiary of Dominion, which holds 100% of the voting interests. The trusts sold capital securities representing preferred beneficial interests and 97% beneficial ownership in the assets held by the trusts. In exchange for the funds realized from the sale of the capital securities and common securities that represent the remaining 3% beneficial ownership interest in the assets held by the capital trusts, Dominion issued various junior subordinated notes. The junior subordinated notes constitute 100% of each capital trusts assets. Each trust must redeem its capital securities when their respective junior subordinated notes are repaid at maturity or if redeemed prior to maturity.
In January 2013, Dominion repaid its $258 million 7.83% unsecured junior subordinated debentures and redeemed all 250thousand units of the $250 million 7.83% Dominion Resources Capital Trust I capital securities due December1, 2027. The securities were redeemed at a price of $1,019.58 per capital security plus accrued and unpaid distributions.
Interest charges related to Dominions junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts were $1 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes In June 2006 and September 2006, Dominion issued $300 million of June 2006 hybrids and $500 million of September 2006 hybrids, respectively.

Dominion may defer interest payments on the hybrids on one or more occasions for up to 10 consecutive years. If the interest payments on the hybrids are deferred, Dominion may not make distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments during the deferral period. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the hybrids.
Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the June 2006 hybrids, the September 2006 hybrids, and the June 2009 hybrids. Under the terms of the RCCs, Dominion covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders, as may be designated from time to time, that Dominion shall not redeem, repurchase, or defease all or any part of the hybrids, and shall not cause its majority owned subsidiaries to purchase all or any part of the hybrids, on or before their applicable RCC termination date, unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days prior to such activity, Dominion has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the RCCs from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than the applicable characteristics of the hybrids at that time, as more fully described in the RCCs. In September 2011, Dominion amended the RCCs of the June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids to expand the measurement period for consideration of proceeds from the sale of common stock issuances from 180 days to 365 days. In July 2014, Dominion amended the RCC of the June 2009 hybrids to expand the measurement period for consideration of proceeds from the sale of common stock or other equity-like issuances from 180 days to 365 days. The proceeds Dominion receives from the replacement offering, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must equal or exceed the redemption or repurchase price.
As part of Dominions Liability Management Exercise, in October 2014, Dominion redeemed all $685 million of the June 2009 hybrids plus accrued interest with the net proceeds from the issuance of the October 2014 hybrids. In 2015, Dominion purchased and canceled $14 million and $3 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, Dominion purchased and cancelled $37 million and $2 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids, respectively. The redemption and all purchases were conducted in compliance with the RCCs.
Remarketable Subordinated Notes In June 2013, Dominion issued $550 million of 2013 Series A 6.125% Equity Units and $550 million of 2013 Series B 6% Equity Units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. In July 2014, Dominion issued $1.0 billion of 2014 Series A 6.375% Equity Units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. The Corporate Units are listed on the NYSE under the symbols DCUA, DCUB and DCUC, respectively.
Each Corporate Unit consists of a stock purchase contract and 1/20 interest in a RSN issued by Dominion. The stock purchase contracts obligate the holders to purchase shares of Dominion common stock at a future settlement date prior to the relevant RSN maturity date. The purchase price to be paid under the stock purchase contracts is $50 per Corporate Unit and the number of shares to be purchased will be determined under a formula based upon the average closing price of Dominion common stock near the settlement date. The RSNs are pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts.
Dominion makes quarterly interest payments on the RSNs and quarterly contract adjustment payments on the stock purchase contracts, at the rates described below. Dominion may defer payments on the stock purchase contracts and the RSNs for one or more consecutive periods but generally not beyond the purchase contract settlement date. If payments are deferred, Dominion may not make any cash distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments. Also, during the deferral period, Dominion may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the RSNs.
Dominion has recorded the present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability offset by a charge to equity. Interest payments on the RSNs are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as imputed interest expense. In calculating diluted EPS, Dominion applies the treasury stock method to the Equity Units.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Equity Units and 2014 Equity Units, Dominion expects to remarket the 2013 Series A, 2013 Series B and 2014 Series A RSNs during the first and second quarters of 2016, and the second quarter of 2017, respectively.Following a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the RSNs will be reset, interest will be payable on a semi-annual basis and Dominion will cease to have the ability to redeem the RSNs at its option or defer interest payments. Proceeds of each remarketing will belong to the investors in the related equity units and will be held and applied on their behalf at the settlement date of the related stock purchase contracts to pay the purchase price to Dominion for issuance of its common stock.
129 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued Under the terms of the stock purchase contracts, assuming no anti-dilution or other adjustments, Dominion will issue between 8.5million and 10.0million shares of its common stock in both April 2016 and July 2016 and between 11.5million and 14.4million shares in July 2017. A total of 40.3million shares of Dominions common stock has been reserved for issuance in connection with the stock purchase contracts.

Virginia Power is authorized to issue up to 10million shares of preferred stock, $100 liquidation preference. During 2014, Virginia Power redeemed 2.59million shares, which represented all outstanding series of its preferred stock, some of which were redeemed as a part of Dominions Liability Management Exercise in September 2014. Upon redemption, each series was no longer outstanding for any purpose and dividends ceased to accumulate. Virginia Power had no preferred stock issued and outstanding at December31, 2015 or 2014.
N OTE 19. E QUITY Issuance of Common Stock D OMINION Dominion maintains Dominion Direct  and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in Dominions common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2014, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. In April 2014, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.
During 2015, Dominion received cash proceeds, net of fees and commissions, of $783 million from the issuance of approximately 11million shares of common stock through various programs resulting in approximately 596million of shares of common stock outstanding at December31, 2015. These proceeds include cash of $284 million received from the issuance of 4.1million of such shares through Dominion Direct  and employee savings plans.
In December 2014, Dominion filed an SEC shelf registration for the sale of debt and equity securities including the ability to sell common stock through an at-the-market program. Also in December 2014, Dominion entered into four separate sales agency agreements to effect sales under the program and pursuant to which it may offer from time to time up to $500 million aggregate amount of its common stock. Sales of common stock can be made by means of privately negotiated transactions, as transactions on the NYSE at market prices or in such other transactions as are agreed upon by Dominion and the sales agents and in conformance with applicable securities laws. During the first and second quarters of 2015, Dominion provided sales instructions to the sales agents and issued 4.0 million shares through at-the-market issuances and received cash proceeds of $297million, net of fees and commissions paid of $3 million. Following these issuances, Dominion has the ability to issue up to approximately $200 million of stock under the 2014 sales agency agreements. However, Dominion completed its 2015 planned market issuances of equity in May 2015 with the issuance of 2.8million shares and receipt of proceeds of $202million through a registered underwritten public offering.
V IRGINIA P OWER In 2015, 2014 and 2013, Virginia Power did not issue any shares of its common stock to Dominion.
D OMINION G AS On September30, 2013, Dominion contributed its wholly-owned subsidiaries DTI, East Ohio and Dominion Iroquois to Dominion Gas in exchange for 100% of its limited liability company membership interests.

See Note 17 for more information.
Repurchase of Common Stock Dominion did not repurchase any shares in 2015 or 2014 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2016, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which do not count against its stock repurchase authorization.
Purchase of Dominion Midstream Units In September 2015, Dominion initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream. The common units may be acquired by Dominion over the 12 month period following commencement of the program at the discretion of management. Through December 31, 2015, Dominion purchased approximately 887,000 common units for $25 million. In the first quarter of 2016, Dominion purchased approximately 377,000 additional common units for approximately $10 million. At February 23, 2016, Dominion still has the ability to purchase up to $15 million of common units under the program.

The Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan permits grants of restricted stock and stock options. Under provisions of these plans, employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase common stock at a price not less than its fair market value at the date of grant with a maximum term of eight years. Option terms are set at the discretion of the CGN Committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors itself, as provided under each plan. At December31, 2015, approximately 25million shares were available for future grants under these plans.
Dominion measures and recognizes compensation expense relating to share-based payment transactions over the vesting period based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Dominions results for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 include $39 million, $39 million, and $31 million, respectively, of compensation costs and $14 million, $14 million, and $11 million, respectively of income tax benefits related to Dominions stock-based compensation arrangements. Stock-based compensation cost is reported in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominions Consolidated Statements of Income. Excess Tax Benefits are classified as a financing cash flow. Dominion realized $3million of excess tax benefits from the vesting of restricted stock awards and exercise of stock options during the year ended December31, 2015, and less than $1million during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013.
R ESTRICTED S TOCK Restricted stock grants are made to officers under Dominions LTIP and may also be granted to certain key non-officer employees from time to time. The fair value of Dominions restricted stock awards is equal to the closing price of Dominions stock on the date of grant. New shares are issued for restricted stock awards on the date of grant and generally vest over a three-year service period. The following table provides a summary of restricted stock activity for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Shares Weighted - average GrantDate Fair Value (thousands) Nonvested at December31, 2012 1,085 $ 44.46 Granted 312 54.70 Vested (356 ) 39.00 Cancelled and forfeited (34 ) 51.11 Nonvested at December31, 2013 1,007 $ 49.35 Granted 354 67.98 Vested (278 ) 44.50 Cancelled and forfeited (18 ) 53.61 Nonvested at December31, 2014 1,065 $ 56.74 Granted 302 73.26 Vested (510 ) 50.71 Cancelled and forfeited (2 ) 62.62 Nonvested at December31, 2015 855 $ 66.16 As of December31,2015, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards totaled $27 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The fair value of restricted stock awards that vested was $37 million, $19 million, and $20 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Employees may elect to have shares of restricted stock withheld upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The number of shares withheld will vary for each employee depending on the vesting date fair market value of Dominion stock and the applicable federal, state and local tax withholding rates.
G OAL -B ASED S TOCK Goal-based stock awards are granted under Dominions LTIP to officers who have not achieved a certain targeted level of share 135 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued ownership, in lieu of cash-based performance grants. Goal-based stock awards may also be made to certain key non-officer employees from time to time. Current outstanding goal-based shares include awards granted to officers in February 2014 and February 2015.
The issuance of awards is based on the achievement of two performance metrics during a two-year period: TSR relative to that of companies listed as members of the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the end of the performance period and ROIC. The actual number of shares issued will vary between zero and 200% of targeted shares depending on the level of performance metrics achieved. The fair value of goal-based stock is equal to the closing price of Dominions stock on the date of grant. Goal-based stock awards granted to key non-officer employees convert to restricted stock at the end of the two-year performance period and generally vest three years from the original grant date. Awards to officers vest at the end of the two-year performance period. All goal-based stock awards are settled by issuing new shares.

In January 2016, the CGN Committee determined the actual performance against metrics established for the February 2014 awards with a performance period that ended December31, 2015. Based on that determination, the total number of shares to be issued under the February 2014 goal-based stock awards was approximately 10thousand.
As of December31, 2015, unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested goal-based stock awards was not material.
C ASH -B ASED P ERFORMANCE G RANTS Cash-based performance grants are made to Dominions officers under Dominions LTIP. The actual payout of cash-based performance grants will vary between zero and 200% of the targeted amount based on the level of performance metrics achieved.
In February 2012, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. A portion of the grant, representing the initial payout of $8 million was paid in December 2013, based on the achievement of two performance metrics during 2012 and 2013: TSR relative to that of companies listed as members of the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the end of the performance period and ROIC. The total amount of the award under the grant was $12 million and the remaining portion of the grant was paid in January 2014.
In February 2013, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. A portion of the grant, representing the initial payout of $14 million was paid in December 2014, based on the achievement of two performance metrics during 2013 and 2014: TSR relative to that of companies listed as members of the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the end of the performance period and ROIC. The total amount of the award under the grant was $20 million and the remaining portion of the grant was paid in February 2015.
In February 2014, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers. Payout of the performance grant is expected to occur by March15, 2016 based on the achievement of two performance metrics during 2014 and 2015: TSR relative to that of companies listed as members of the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the end of the performance period and ROIC. The total expected award under the grant is $10 million and the grant is expected to be paid by March15, 2016. At December31, 2015, a liability of $10 million had been accrued for this award.
In February 2015, a cash-based performance grant was made to officers.

At December31, 2015, the targeted amount of the grant was $14 million and a liability of $7 million had been accrued for this award.
N OTE 20. D IVIDEND R ESTRICTIONS The Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December31,2015, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power.
The Ohio Commission may prohibit any public service company, including East Ohio, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December31, 2015, the Ohio Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by East Ohio.
Certain agreements associated with the Companies credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict the Companies ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December31,2015.
See Note 17 for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes and equity units, initially in the form of corporate units.
N OTE 21. E MPLOYEE B ENEFIT P LANS Dominion and Dominion GasDefined Benefit Plans Dominion provides certain retirement benefits to eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. Dominion Gas participates in a number of the Dominion-sponsored retirement 136 Table of Contents plans. Under the terms of its benefit plans, Dominion reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plans. From time to time in the past, benefits have changed, and some of these changes have reduced benefits.
Dominion maintains qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all employees. Retirement benefits are based primarily on years of service, age and the employees compensation. Dominions funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with the provisions of ERISA. The pension program also provides benefits to certain retired executives under a company-sponsored nonqualified employee benefit plan. The nonqualified plan is funded through contributions to a grantor trust. Dominion also provides retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits with annual employee premiums based on several factors such as age, retirement date and years of service.
Pension benefits for Dominion Gas employees not represented by collective bargaining units are covered by the Dominion Pension Plan, a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Dominion that provides benefits to multiple Dominion subsidiaries. Pension benefits for Dominion Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units are covered by separate pension plans for East Ohio and, for DTI, a plan that provides benefits to employees of both DTI and Hope. Employee compensation is the basis for allocating pension costs and obligations between DTI and Hope and determining East Ohios share of total pension costs.
Retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits for Dominion Gas employees not represented by collective bargaining units are covered by the Dominion Retiree Health and Welfare Plan, a plan sponsored by Dominion that provides certain retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits to multiple Dominion subsidiaries. Retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits for Dominion Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units are covered by separate other postretirement benefit plans for East Ohio and, for DTI, a plan that provides benefits to both DTI and Hope. Employee headcount is the basis for allocating other postretirement benefit costs and obligations between DTI and Hope and determining East Ohios share of total other postretirement benefit costs.
Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are affected by employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and years of service), the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. These costs may also be affected by changes in key assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality rates and the rate of compensation increases.
Dominion uses December31 as the measurement date for all of its employee benefit plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates. Dominion uses the market-related value of pension plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets, a component of net periodic pension cost, for all pension plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates. The market-related value recognizes changes in fair value on a straight-line basis over a four-year period, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Changes in fair value are measured as the difference between the expected and actual plan asset returns, including dividends, interest and realized and unrealized investment gains and losses. Since the market-related value recognizes changes in fair value over a four-year period, the future market-related value of pension plan assets will be impacted as previously unrecognized changes in fair value are recognized.
Dominions pension and other postretirement benefit plans hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Dominions pension and other postretirement plan assets experienced aggregate actual losses of $72 million in 2015 and aggregate actual returns of $706 million in 2014, versus expected returns of $648 million and $610 million, respectively. Dominion Gas pension and other postretirement plan assets for employees represented by collective bargaining units experienced aggregate actual losses of $13 million in 2015 and aggregate actual returns of $157 million in 2014, versus expected returns of $150 million and $138 million, respectively. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.
The Medicare Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Dominion determined that the prescription drug benefit offered under its other postretirement benefit plans is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Dominion and Dominion Gas received a federal subsidy of $4 million and $1 million, respectively, for 2014. Effective January1, 2013, Dominion changed its method of receiving the subsidy under Medicare Part D for retiree prescription drug coverage from the Retiree Drug Subsidy to the EGWP. This change reduced other postretirement benefit costs by approximately $20 million annually beginning in 2012. As a result of the adoption of the EGWP, Dominion begins to receive an increased level of Medicare Part D subsidies in the form of reduced costs rather than a direct reimbursement.
In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries published new mortality tables and mortality improvement scales. Such tables and scales are used to develop mortality assumptions for use in determining pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and expense. Following evaluation of the new tables, Dominion changed its assumption for mortality rates to reflect a generational improvement scale. As a result of this change in assumption, at December31, 2014 Dominion and Dominion Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) increased their pension benefit obligations by $131 million and $10 million, respectively, and increased their accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by $32 million and $7 million, respectively. This change increased net periodic benefit cost for Dominion and Dominion Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) by $25 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2015.
Dominion remeasured all of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the second quarter of 2013. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the pension benefit obligation of $354 million and a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $78 million. For Dominion Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units, the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the pension benefit obligation of $28 million and a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $9 million. The impact of the 137 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued remeasurement on net periodic benefit (credit) cost was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date and reduced net periodic benefit cost for 2013 by $36 million, excluding the impacts of curtailments, and for Dominion Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units by $2 million. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 4.80% for the pension plans and 4.70% for the other postretirement benefit plans. All other assumptions used for the remeasurement were consistent with the measurement as of December31, 2012.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, Dominion remeasured its other postretirement benefit plans as a result of a plan amendment that changed medical coverage for certain Medicare-eligible retirees effective April 2014. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $220 million. The impact of the remeasurement on net periodic benefit (credit) cost was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date and reduced net periodic benefit cost for 2013 by $8 million. The amendment is expected to reduce net periodic benefit cost by $40 million to $60 million for each of the next five years. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 4.80%. All other assumptions used for the remeasurement were consistent with the measurement as of December31, 2012.
In the third quarter of 2014, East Ohio remeasured its other postretirement benefit plan as a result of an amendment that changed medical coverage upon the attainment of age 65 for certain future retirees effective January1, 2016. For employees represented by collective bargaining units, the remeasurement resulted in an increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $22 million. The impact of the remeasurement on net periodic benefit credit was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date and reduced net periodic benefit credit for 2014, for employees represented by collective bargaining units, by less than $1 million. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 4.20% and the expected long-term rate of return used was 8.50%. All other assumptions used for the remeasurement were consistent with the measurement as of December31, 2013.

The ABO for all of Dominions defined benefit pension plans was $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion at December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The ABO for the defined benefit pension plans covering Dominion Gas employees represented by collective bargaining units was $578 million and $604 million at December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Under its funding policies, Dominion evaluates plan funding requirements annually, usually in the fourth quarter after receiving updated plan information from its actuary. Based on the funded status of each plan and other factors, Dominion determines the amount of contributions for the current year, if any, at that time. During 2015, Dominion and Dominion Gas made no contributions to the qualified defined benefit pension plans and no contributions are currently expected in 2016. In July 2012, the MAP 21 Act was signed into law. This Act includes an increase in the interest rates used to determine plan sponsors pension contributions for required funding purposes. In 2014, the HATFA of 2014 was signed into law. Similar to the MAP 21 Act, the HATFA of 2014 adjusts the rules for calculating interest rates used in determining funding obligations. It is estimated that the new interest rates will reduce required pension contributions through 2019. Dominion believes that required pension contributions will rise subsequent to 2019, resulting in an estimated $200 million reduction in net cumulative required contributions over a 10-year period.
Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in utility customers rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, certain of Dominions subsidiaries, including Dominion Gas, fund other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs. Dominions remaining subsidiaries do not prefund other postretirement benefit costs but instead pay claims as presented. Dominions contributions to VEBAs, all of which pertained to Dominion Gas employees, totaled $12 million for both 2015 and 2014, and Dominion expects to contribute approximately $12 million to the Dominion VEBAs in 2016, all of which pertains to Dominion Gas employees.
Dominion and Dominion Gas do not expect any pension or other postretirement plan assets to be returned during 2016.

As a participating employer in various pension plans sponsored by Dominion, Dominion Gas is subject to Dominions investment policies for such plans. To minimize risk, funds are broadly diversified among asset classes, investment strategies and investment advisors. The strategic target asset allocations for Dominions pension funds are 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments. U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap, 140 Table of Contents mid-cap and small-cap companies located in the United States. Non-U.S. equity includes investments in large-cap and small-cap companies located outside of the United States including both developed and emerging markets. Fixed income includes corporate debt instruments of companies from diversified industries and U.S. Treasuries. The U.S. equity, non-U.S. equity and fixed income investments are in individual securities as well as mutual funds. Real estate includes equity REITs and investments in partnerships. Other alternative investments include partnership investments in private equity, debt and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.
Dominion also utilizes common/collective trust funds as an investment vehicle for its defined benefit plans. A common/collective trust fund is a pooled fund operated by a bank or trust company for investment of the assets of various organizations and individuals in a well-diversified portfolio. Common/collective trust funds are funds of grouped assets that follow various investment strategies.
Strategic investment policies are established for Dominions prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of Dominions assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns. Financial derivatives may be used to obtain or manage market exposures and to hedge assets and liabilities.

145 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued The components of AOCI and regulatory assets and liabilities for Dominions and Dominion Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) plans that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost are as follows: Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits At December31, 2015 2014 2015 2014 (millions) DOMINION Net actuarial loss $ 2,381 $ 2,382 $ 114 $ 139 Prior service (credit) cost 5 7 (237 ) (233 ) Total (1) $ 2,386 $ 2,389 $ (123 ) $ (94 ) DOMINION GAS Net actuarial loss $ 380 $ 303 $ 33 $ 43 Prior service (credit) cost 1 1 7 7 Total (2) $ 381 $ 304 $ 40 $ 50 (1) As of December31, 2015, of the $2.4 billion and $(123) million related to pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, $1.4 billion and $(90) million, respectively, are included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities. As of December31, 2014, of the $2.4 billion and $(94) million related to pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, $1.4 billion and $(81) million, respectively, are included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities.
(2) As of December31, 2015, of the $381 million related to pension benefits, $138 million is included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities; the $40 million related to other postretirement benefits is included entirely in regulatory assets and liabilities. As of December31, 2014, of the $304 million related to pension benefits, $112 million is included in AOCI, with the remainder included in regulatory assets and liabilities; the $50 million related to other postretirement benefits is included entirely in regulatory assets and liabilities.
The following table provides the components of AOCI and regulatory assets and liabilities for Dominions and Dominion Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) plans as of December31, 2015 that are expected to be amortized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost in 2016: PensionBenefits OtherPostretirement Benefits (millions) DOMINION Net actuarial loss $ 111 $ 5 Prior service (credit) cost 1 (28 ) DOMINION GAS Net actuarial loss $ 13 $ 1 Prior service (credit) cost  1 The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality are critical assumptions in determining net periodic benefit (credit) cost. Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor (except for the expected long-term rates of return) to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions used for Dominions pension and other postretirement plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates, including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates.
Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for its pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates, by using a combination of:  Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions;  Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes;  Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;  Forecasts of an independent investment advisor;  Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and  Investment allocation of plan assets.
Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates.
Dominion develops its mortality assumption using plan-specific studies and projects mortality improvement using scales developed by the Society of Actuaries for all its plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for Dominions retiree healthcare plans, including those in which Dominion Gas participates. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects for Dominions and Dominion Gas (for employees represented by collective bargaining units) other postretirement benefit plans: OtherPostretirementBenefits Onepercentage point increase Onepercentage point decrease (millions) DOMINION Effect on net periodic cost for 2016 $ 21 $ (13 ) Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2015 157 (129 ) DOMINION GAS Effect on net periodic cost for 2016 $ 5 $ (3 ) Effect on other postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2015 34 (26 ) Dominion Gas (Employees Not Represented by Collective Bargaining Units) and Virginia Power-Participation in Defined Benefit Plans Virginia Power employees and Dominion Gas employees not represented by collective bargaining units are covered by the Dominion Pension Plan described above. As participating employers, Virginia Power and Dominion Gas are subject to Dominions funding policy, which is to contribute annually an amount that is in accordance with ERISA. During 2015, Virginia Power and Dominion Gas made no contributions to the Dominion Pension Plan, and no contributions to this plan are currently expected in 2016. Virginia Powers net periodic pension cost related to this plan was $97 million, $75 million and $96 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Dominion Gas net periodic pension credit related to this plan was $(38) million, $(37)million and $(27) million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, 146 Table of Contents respectively. Net periodic pension (credit) cost is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in their respective Consolidated Statements of Income. The funded status of various Dominion subsidiary groups and employee compensation are the basis for determining the share of total pension costs for participating Dominion subsidiaries. See Note 24 for Virginia Power and Dominion Gas amounts due to/from Dominion related to this plan.
Retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits, for Virginia Power employees and for Dominion Gas employees not represented by collective bargaining units, are covered by the Dominion Retiree Health and Welfare Plan described above. Virginia Powers net periodic benefit (credit) cost related to this plan was $(16) million, $(18) million and $5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Dominion Gas net periodic benefit (credit) cost related to this plan was $(5) million, $(5) million and less than $1 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net periodic benefit (credit) cost is reflected in other operations and maintenance expenses in their respective Consolidated Statements of Income. Employee headcount is the basis for determining the share of total other postretirement benefit costs for participating Dominion subsidiaries. See Note 24 for Virginia Power and Dominion Gas amounts due to/from Dominion related to this plan.
Dominion holds investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans in which Virginia Power and Dominion Gas employees participate. Any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future increases in the net periodic cost recognized for such employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash that Virginia Power and Dominion Gas will provide to Dominion for their shares of employee benefit plan contributions.
Certain regulatory authorities have held that amounts recovered in rates for other postretirement benefits, in excess of benefits actually paid during the year, must be deposited in trust funds dedicated for the sole purpose of paying such benefits. Accordingly, Virginia Power and Dominion Gas fund other postretirement benefit costs through VEBAs. During 2015 and 2014, Virginia Power made no contributions to the VEBA and does not expect to contribute to the VEBA in 2016. Dominion Gas made no contributions to the VEBAs for employees not represented by collective bargaining units during 2015 and does not expect to contribute in 2016. Dominion Gas contributions to VEBAs for employees not represented by collective bargaining units were $1 million for 2014.
Defined Contribution Plans Dominion also sponsors defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all employees. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Dominion recognized $43 million, $41 million and $40 million, respectively, as employer matching contributions to these plans. Dominion Gas participates in these employee savings plans, both specific to Dominion Gas and that cover multiple Dominion subsidiaries. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Dominion Gas recognized $7 million as employer matching contributions to these plans. Virginia Power also participates in these employee savings plans. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Virginia Power recognized $18 million, $17 million and $16 million, respectively, as employer matching contributions to these plans.
N OTE 22. C OMMITMENTS AND C ONTINGENCIES As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in legal proceedings before various courts and are periodically subject to governmental examinations (including by regulatory authorities), inquiries and investigations. Certain legal proceedings and governmental examinations involve demands for unspecified amounts of damages, are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For such matters for which the Companies cannot estimate a range of possible loss, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the litigation or investigative processes such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For legal proceedings and governmental examinations for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any accrued liability is recorded on a gross basis with a receivable also recorded for any probable insurance recoveries. Estimated ranges of loss are inclusive of legal fees and net of any anticipated insurance recoveries. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the Companies maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such legal proceedings and governmental examinations will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current proceedings not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Companies.
Environmental Matters The Companies are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.
A IR CAA The CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nations air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies facilities are subject to the CAAs permitting and other requirements.
MATS In December2011, the EPA issued MATS for coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. The rule establishes strict emission limits for mercury, particulate matter as a surrogate fortoxic metals and hydrogen chloride as a surrogate for acid gases. The rule includes a limited use provision for oil-fired units 147 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued with annual capacity factors under 8% that provides an exemption from emission limits, and allows compliance with operational work practice standards. Compliance was required by April16, 2015, with certain limited exceptions. However, in June 2014, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality granted a one-year MATS compliance extension for two coal-fired units at Yorktown to defer planned retirements and allow for continued operation of the units to address reliability concerns while necessary electric transmission upgrades are being completed. These coal units will need to continue operating until at least April 2017 due to delays in transmission upgrades needed to maintain electric reliability, which based on assumptions about the timing for required agency actions and construction schedules are expected to be completed by no earlier than the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, in October 2015 Virginia Power submitted a request to the EPA for an additional one year compliance extension under an EPA Administrative Order.
In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision holding that the EPA failed to take cost into account when the agency first decided to regulate the emissions from coal- and oil-fired plants, and remanded the MATS rule back to the D.C. Circuit Court. However, the Supreme Court did not vacate or stay the effective date and implementation of the MATS rule. On November 20, 2015, in response to the Supreme Court decision, the EPA proposed a supplemental finding that consideration of cost does not alter the agencys previous conclusion that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units under Section 112 of the CAA.On December 15, 2015, the D.C. Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the MATS rulemaking proceeding back to the EPA without setting aside judgment, noting that EPA had represented it was on track to issue by April 15, 2016, a final finding regarding its consideration of cost.These actions do not change Virginia Powers plans to close coal units at Yorktown or the need to complete necessary electricity transmission upgrades by 2017. Since the MATS rule remains in effect and Dominion is complying with the requirements of the rule, Dominion does not expect any adverse impacts to its operations at this time.
CAIR The EPA established CAIR with the intent to require significant reductions in SO 2 and NO X emissions from electric generating facilities. In July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling vacating CAIR. In December 2008, the Court denied rehearing, but also issued a decision to remand CAIR to the EPA. In July 2011, the EPA issued a replacement rule for CAIR, called CSAPR, that required 28 states to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines. CSAPR established new SO 2 and NO X emissions cap and trade programs that were completely independent of the current ARP. Specifically, CSAPR required reductions in SO 2 and NO X emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 25 MW or more through annual NO X emissions caps, NO X emissions caps during the ozone season (May 1 through September30) and annual SO 2 emission caps with differing requirements for two groups of affected states.
CSAPR Following numerous petitions by industry participants for reviewand a successful motion for stay, in October 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered that the EPAs motion to lift the stay of CSAPR be granted. Further, the Court granted the EPAs request to shift the CSAPR compliance deadlines by three years, so that Phase 1 emissions budgets (which would have gone into effect in 2012 and 2013) will apply in 2015 and 2016, and Phase 2 emissions budgets will apply in 2017 and beyond. CSAPR replaced CAIR beginning in January 2015. The cost to comply is not expected to be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Future outcomes of any additional litigation and/or any action to issue a revised rule could affect the assessment regarding cost of compliance.
Ozone Standards In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule tightening the ozone standard from 75-ppb to 70-ppb. The EPA is expected to complete attainment designations for a new standard by December 2017 and states will have until 2020 or 2021 to develop plans to address the new standard. Until the states have developed implementation plans, the Companies are unable to predict whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls. However, if significant expenditures are required to implement additional controls, it could adversely affect the Companies results of operations and cash flows.
Hazardous Air Pollutants Standards In August 2010, the EPA issued revised National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines, which was amended in March 2011 and January 2013. The rule establishes emission standards for control of hazardous air pollutants for engines at smaller facilities, known as area sources. As a result of these regulations, Dominion Gas has spent $2 million to install emissions controls on several compressor engines. Further capital spending is not expected to be material.
NSPS In August 2012, the EPA issued the first NSPS impacting the natural gas production and gathering sectors and made revisions to the NSPS for natural gas processing and transmission facilities. These rules establish equipment performance specifications and emissions standards for control of VOC emissions for natural gas production wells, tanks, pneumatic controllers, and compressors in the upstream sector. In September 2015, the EPA issued a proposed NSPS to regulate methane and VOC emissions from transmission and storage, gathering and boosting, production and processing facilities. All projects which commence construction after September 2015 will be required to comply with this regulation. Dominion is evaluating the proposed regulation and cannot currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.
Methane Emissions In January 2015, as part of its Climate Action Plan, the EPA announced plans to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector including natural gas processing and transmission sources. In July 2015, the EPA announced the next generation of its voluntary Natural Gas STAR program, the Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. The proposed program covers the entire natural gas sector from production to distribution, with 148 Table of Contents more emphasis on transparency and increased reporting for both annual emissions and reductions achieved through implementation measures.Dominion is evaluating the proposed program and cannot currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.
C LIMATE C HANGE L EGISLATION AND R EGULATION In October 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions filed by several industry groups, states, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce seeking review of the D.C. Circuit Courts June 2012 decision upholding the EPAs regulation of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the CAAs permitting programs. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA lacked the authority under the CAA to require PSD or Title V permits for stationary sources based solely on GHG emissions. However, the Court upheld the EPAs ability to require BACT for GHG for sources that are otherwise subject to PSD or Title V permitting for conventional pollutants. In July 2014, the EPA issued a memorandum specifying that it will no longer apply or enforce federal regulations or EPA-approved PSD state implementation plan provisions that require new and modified stationary sources to obtain a PSD permit when GHGs are the only pollutant that would be emitted at levels that exceed the permitting thresholds. In August 2015, the EPA published a final rule rescinding the requirement for all new and modified major sources to obtain permits based solely on their GHG emissions. In addition, the EPA stated that it will continue to use the existing thresholds to apply to sources that are otherwise subject to PSD for conventional pollutants until it completes a new rulemaking either justifying and upholding those thresholds or setting new ones. Some states have issued interim guidance that follows the EPA guidance. Due to uncertainty regarding what additional actions states may take to amend their existing regulations and what action the EPA ultimately takes to address the Court ruling under a new rulemaking, the Companies cannot predict the impact to their financial statements at this time.
In July 2011, the EPA signed a final rule deferring the need for PSD and Title V permitting for CO 2 emissions for biomass projects. This rule temporarily deferred for a period of up to three years the consideration of CO 2 emissions from biomass projects when determining whether a stationary source meets the PSD and Title V applicability thresholds, including those for the application of BACT.The deferral policy expired in July 2014. In July 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated this rule; however, a mandate making this decision effective has not been issued.Virginia Power converted three coal-fired generating stations, Altavista, Hopewell and Southampton, to biomass during the CO 2 deferral period. It is unclear how the courts decision or the EPAs final policy regarding the treatment of specific feedstock will affect biomass sources that were permitted during the deferral period; however, the expenditures to comply with any new requirements could be material to Dominions and Virginia Powers financial statements.
W ATER The CWA, as amended, is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The Companies must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities.
In October 2014, the final regulations under Section316(b) of the CWA that govern existing facilities and new units at existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold became effective. The rule establishes a national standard for impingement based on seven compliance options, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA has delegated entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of five mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and six optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Dominion and Virginia Power have 14 and 11 facilities, respectively, that may be subject to the final regulations. Dominion anticipates that it will have to install impingement control technologies at many of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. Dominion and Virginia Power are currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technology, cost and benefit studies. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominions and Virginia Powers results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing regulatory framework in Virginia provides rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for Virginia Power.
In September 2015, the EPA released a final rule to revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam Electric Power Generating Category. The final rule establishes updated standards for wastewater discharges that apply primarily at coal and oil steam generating stations. Affected facilities are required to convert from wet to dry or closed cycle coal ash management, improve existing wastewater treatment systems and/or install new wastewater treatment technologies in order to meet the new discharge limits. Virginia Power has eight facilities that may be subject to additional wastewater treatment requirements associated with the final rule. The expenditures to comply with these new requirements are expected to be material.
S OLID AND H AZARDOUS W ASTE The CERCLA, as amended, provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the U.S. government either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under the CERCLA, as amended, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of contaminated sites, can be jointly, severally and strictly liable for the cost of cleanup. These potentially responsible parties can be ordered to perform a cleanup, be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, voluntarily settle with the U.S. government concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight.
149 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued From time to time, Dominion, Virginia Power, or Dominion Gas may be identified as a potentially responsible party to a Superfund site. The EPA (or a state) can either allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial action or conduct the remedial investigation and action itself and then seek reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Each party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the cleanup costs. These parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement from their insurance companies. As a result, Dominion, Virginia Power, or Dominion Gas may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the Superfund law or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of waste. Except as noted below, the Companies do not believe this will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
In September 2011, the EPA issued a UAO to Virginia Power and 22 other parties, ordering specific remedial action of certain areas at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina.Virginia Power does not believe it is a liable party under CERCLA based on its alleged connection to the site.In November 2011, Virginia Power and a number of other parties notified the EPA that they are declining to undertake the work set forth in the UAO.
The EPA may seek to enforce a UAO in court pursuant to its enforcement authority under CERCLA, and may seek recovery of its costs in undertaking removal or remedial action.If the court determines that a respondent failed to comply with the UAO without sufficient cause, the EPA may also seek civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day for the violation and punitive damages of up to three times the costs incurred by the EPA as a result of the partys failure to comply with the UAO.Virginia Power is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts related to the Ward Transformer matter.
Dominion has determined that it is associated with 17 former manufactured gas plant sites, three of which pertain to Virginia Power and 12 of which pertain to Dominion Gas. Studies conducted by other utilities at their former manufactured gas plant sites have indicated that those sites contain coal tar and other potentially harmful materials. None of the former sites with which the Companies are associated is under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency. At one of the former sites, Dominion is conducting a state-approved post closure groundwater monitoring program and an environmental land use restriction has been recorded. Another site has been accepted into a state-based voluntary remediation program. Virginia Power is currently evaluating the nature and extent of the contamination from this site as well as potential remedial options. Preliminary costs for options under evaluation for the site range from $1 million to $22 million. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the other sites, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts.
See below for discussion on ash pond and landfill closure costs.
Other Legal Matters The Companies are defendants in a number of lawsuits and claims involving unrelated incidents of property damage and personal injury. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these matters, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts; however, they could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
A PPALACHIAN G ATEWAY Following the completion of the Appalachian Gateway project in 2012, DTI received multiple change order requests and other claims for additional payments from a pipeline contractor for the project. In July 2013, DTI filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for breach of contract as well as accounting and declaratory relief. The contractor filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion to transfer venue to Pennsylvania and/or West Virginia, where the pipelines were constructed. DTI filed an opposition to the contractors motion in August 2013. In November 2013, the court granted the contractors motion on the basis that DTI must first comply with the dispute resolution process. In July 2015, the contractor filed a complaint against DTI in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In August 2015, DTI filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion to transfer venue to Virginia. This case is pending. DTI has accrued a liability of $6 million for this matter. Dominion Gas cannot currently estimate additional financial statement impacts, but there could be a material impact to its financial condition and/or cash flows.
A SH P OND AND L ANDFILL C LOSURE C OSTS In September 2014, Virginia Power received a notice from the SELC on behalf of the Potomac Riverkeeper and Sierra Club alleging CWA violations at Possum Point. The notice alleges unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater from Possum Points historical and active ash storage facilities. A similar notice from the SELC on behalf of the Sierra Club was subsequently received related to Chesapeake. In December 2014, Virginia Power offered to close all of its coal ash ponds and landfills at Possum Point, Chesapeake and Bremo as settlement of the potential litigation. While the issue is open to potential further negotiations, the SELC declined the offer as presented in January 2015 and, in March 2015, filed a lawsuit related to its claims of the alleged CWA violations at Chesapeake. Virginia Power filed a motion to dismiss in April 2015, which was denied in November 2015. As a result of the December 2014 settlement offer, Virginia Power recognized a charge of $121 million in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2014.
In April 2015, the EPAs final rule regulating the management of CCRs stored in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills was published in the Federal Register. The final rule regulates CCR landfills, existing ash ponds that still receive and manage CCRs, and inactive ash ponds that do not receive, but still store CCRs. Virginia Power currently operates inactive ash ponds, existing ash ponds, and CCR landfills subject to the final rule at eight different facilities.The enactment of the final rule in April 2015 created a legal obligation for Virginia Power to retrofit or close all of its inactive and existing ash ponds over a certain period of time, as well as perform required monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care activities as necessary. In 2015, Virginia Power recorded a $386 million ARO related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs. Recognition of the ARO also resulted in a $99 million incremental charge recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, a $166 million increase in property, plant, and equip- 150 Table of Contents ment associated with asset retirement costs, and a $121 million reduction in other noncurrent liabilities related to reversal of the contingent liability described above since the ARO obligation created by the final CCR rule represents similar activities. Virginia Power is in the process of obtaining the necessary permits to complete the work. The actual AROs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation in 2015.
C OVE P OINT Dominion is constructing the Liquefaction Project at the Cove Point facility, which would enable the facility to liquefy domestically-produced natural gas and export it as LNG. In September 2014, FERC issued an order granting authorization for Cove Point to construct, modify and operate the Liquefaction Project. In October 2014, several parties filed a motion with FERC to stay the order and requested rehearing. In May 2015, FERC denied the requests for stay and rehearing.
Two parties have separately filed petitions for review of the FERC order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which petitions have been consolidated. Separately, one party requested a stay of the FERC order until the judicial proceedings are complete, which the court denied in June 2015.
In May 2014, the Maryland Commission granted the CPCN authorizing the construction of a generating station in connection with the Liquefaction Project. The CPCN obligates Cove Point to make payments totaling $48 million. These payments consist of $40 million to the Strategic Energy Investments Fund over a five-year period beginning in 2015 and $8 million to Maryland low income energy assistance programs over a twenty-year period expected to begin in 2018. In December 2014, upon receipt of applicable approvals to commence construction of the generating station, Dominion recorded the present value of the obligation as an increase to property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability.
In June 2014, a party filed a notice of petition for judicial review of the CPCN with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in Maryland. In September 2014, the party filed with the Maryland Commission a motion to stay the CPCN pending judicial review of the CPCN.In December 2014, the Circuit Court issued an order affirming the Maryland Commissions grant of the CPCN and dismissing the appeal, and the motion for stay was denied by the Maryland Commission.In January 2015, the same party filed a Notice of Appeal of the Baltimore Circuit Courts Order affirming the Maryland Commissions grant of the CPCN with the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. In February 2016, the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland issued an order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in Maryland which affirmed the decision of the Maryland Commission granting the CPCN.
Nuclear Matters In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami caused significant damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in northeast Japan. These events have resulted in significant nuclear safety reviews required by the NRC and industry groups such as INPO. Like other U.S. nuclear operators, Dominion has been gathering supporting data and participating in industry initiatives focused on the ability to respond to and mitigate the consequences of design-basis and beyond-design-basis events at its stations.
In July 2011, an NRC task force provided initial recommendations based on its review of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and in October 2011 the NRC staff prioritized these recommendations into Tiers 1, 2 and 3, with the Tier 1 recommendations consisting of actions which the staff determined should be started without unnecessary delay. In December 2011, the NRC Commissioners approved the agency staffs prioritization and recommendations, and that same month an appropriations act directed the NRC to require reevaluation of external hazards (not limited to seismic and flooding hazards) as soon as possible.
Based on the prioritized recommendations, in March 2012, the NRC issued orders and information requests requiring specific reviews and actions to all operating reactors, construction permit holders and combined license holders based on the lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi event. The orders applicable to Dominion requiring implementation of safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants, and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation have been implemented.The information requests issued by the NRC request each reactor to reevaluate the seismic and external flooding hazards at their site using present-day methods and information, conduct walkdowns of their facilities to ensure protection against the hazards in their current design basis, and to reevaluate their emergency communications systems and staffing levels. The walkdowns of each unit have been completed, audited by the NRC and found to be adequate. Reevaluation of the seismic and external flooding hazards is expected to continue through 2018. Dominion and Virginia Power do not currently expect that compliance with the NRCs information requests will materially impact their financial position, results of operations or cash flows during the implementation period. The NRC staff is evaluating the implementation of the longer term Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations. Dominion and Virginia Power are currently unable to estimate the potential financial impacts related to compliance with Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations.
Nuclear Operations N UCLEAR D ECOMMISSIONING M INIMUM F INANCIAL A SSURANCE The NRC requires nuclear power plant owners to annually update minimum financial assurance amounts for the future decommissioning of their nuclear facilities. Decommissioning involves the decontamination and removal of radioactive contaminants from a nuclear power station once operations have ceased, in accordance with standards established by the NRC. The 2015 calculation for the NRC minimum financial assurance amount, aggregated for Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear units, excluding joint owners assurance amounts and Millstone Unit 1 and Kewaunee, as those units are in a decommissioning state, was $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and has been satisfied by a combination of the funds being collected and deposited in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the real annual rate of return growth of the funds allowed by the NRC. The 2015 NRC minimum financial assurance amounts above were calculated using preliminary December31, 2015 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indices.Dominion believes that the 151 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued amounts currently available in its decommissioning trusts and their expected earnings will be sufficient to cover expected decommissioning costs for the Millstone and Kewaunee units. Virginia Power also believes that the decommissioning funds and their expected earnings for the Surry and North Anna units will be sufficient to cover decommissioning costs, particularly when combined with future ratepayer collections and contributions to these decommissioning trusts, if such future collections and contributions are required. This reflects a positive long-term outlook for trust fund investment returns as the decommissioning of the units will not be complete for decades. Dominion and Virginia Power will continue to monitor these trusts to ensure they meet the NRC minimum financial assurance requirement, which may include, if needed, the use of parent company guarantees, surety bonding or other financial instruments recognized by the NRC. See Note 9 for additional information on nuclear decommissioning trust investments.
N UCLEAR I NSURANCE The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 provides the public up to $13.5 billion of liability protection per nuclear incident, via obligations required of owners of nuclear power plants, and allows for an inflationary provision adjustment every five years. Dominion and Virginia Power have purchased $375 million of coverage from commercial insurance pools for each reactor site with the remainder provided through a mandatory industry retrospective rating plan. In the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear reactor in the U.S., the Companies could be assessed up to $127 million for each of their licensed reactors not to exceed $19 million per year per reactor. There is no limit to the number of incidents for which this retrospective premium can be assessed. However, the NRC granted an exemption in March 2015 to remove Kewaunee from the Secondary Financial Protection program.
The current levels of nuclear property insurance coverage for Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear units is as follows: Coverage (billions) Dominion Millstone $ 1.70 Kewaunee 1.06 Virginia Power (1) Surry $ 1.70 North Anna 1.70 (1) Surry and North Anna share a blanket property limit of $200 million.
Dominions and Virginia Powers nuclear property insurance coverage for Millstone, Surry and North Anna exceeds the NRC minimum requirement for nuclear power plant licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site. Kewaunee meets the NRC minimum requirement of $1.06 billion. This includes coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance be used first, to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe and stable condition and second, to decontaminate the reactor and station site in accordance with a plan approved by the NRC. Nuclear property insurance is provided by NEIL, a mutual insurance company, and is subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy year in which losses exceed the funds available to the insurance company. Dominions and Virginia Powers maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $84 million and $48 million, respectively. Based on the severity of the incident, the Board of Directors of the nuclear insurer has the discretion to lower or eliminate the maximum retrospective premium assessment. Dominion and Virginia Power have the financial responsibility for any losses that exceed the limits or for which insurance proceeds are not available because they must first be used for stabilization and decontamination.
Millstone and Virginia Power also purchase accidental outage insurance from NEIL to mitigate certain expenses, including replacement power costs, associated with the prolonged outage of a nuclear unit due to direct physical damage. Under this program, Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to a retrospective premium assessment for any policy year in which losses exceed funds available to NEIL. Dominions and Virginia Powers maximum retrospective premium assessment for the current policy period is $23 million and $10 million, respectively.
ODEC, a part owner of North Anna, and Massachusetts Municipal and Green Mountain, part owners of Millstones Unit 3, are responsible to Dominion and Virginia Power for their share of the nuclear decommissioning obligation and insurance premiums on applicable units, including any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not covered by insurance.
S PENT N UCLEAR F UEL Dominion and Virginia Power entered into contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The DOE failed to begin accepting the spent fuel on January31, 1998, the date provided by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and by Dominions and Virginia Powers contracts with the DOE. Dominion and Virginia Power have previously received damages award payments and settlement payments related to these contracts.
In 2012, Dominion and Virginia Power resolved additional claims for damages incurred at Millstone, Kewaunee, Surry and North Anna with the Authorized Representative of the Attorney General. Dominion and Virginia Power entered into settlement agreements that resolved claims for damages incurred through December31, 2010, and also provided for periodic payments after that date for damages incurred through December31, 2013.
By mutual agreement of the parties, the settlement agreements are extendable to provide for resolution of damages incurred after 2013. The settlement agreements for the Surry, North Anna and Millstone plants have been extended to provide for periodic payments for damages incurred through December31, 2016. Possible extension of the Kewaunee settlement agreement is being evaluated.
In 2015, Virginia Power and Dominion received payments of $8 million for resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry for the period of January1, 2013 through December31, 2013, and $17 million for resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July1, 2013 through June30, 2014.
In 2014, Virginia Power and Dominion received payments of $27 million for the resolution of claims incurred at North Anna and Surry for the period January1, 2011 through December31, 2012 and $17 million for the resolution of claims incurred at Millstone for the period of July1, 2012 through June30, 2013. In 2014, Dominion also received payments totaling $7 million for the resolution of claims incurred at Kewaunee for periods from January1, 2011 through December31, 2013.
152 Table of Contents Dominion and Virginia Power continue to recognize receivables for certain spent nuclear fuel-related costs that they believe are probable of recovery from the DOE. Dominions receivables for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $87 million and $69 million at December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Virginia Powers receivables for spent nuclear fuel-related costs totaled $54 million and $41 million at December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Pursuant to a November 2013 decision of the U.S Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in January 2014 the Secretary of the DOE sent a recommendation to the U.S. Congress to adjust to zero the current fee of $1 per MWh for electricity paid by civilian nuclear power generators for disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The processes specified in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act for adjustment of the fee have been completed, and as of May 2014, Dominion and Virginia Power are no longer required to pay the waste fee. In 2014, Dominion and Virginia Power recognized fees of $16 million and $10 million, respectively.
Dominion and Virginia Power will continue to manage their spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE.
Long-Term Purchase Agreements At December31,2015, Virginia Power had the following long-term commitments that are noncancelable or are cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total (millions) Purchased electric capacity (1) $ 249 $ 157 $ 104 $ 65 $ 52 $ 46 $ 673 (1) Commitments represent estimated amounts payable for capacity under power purchase contracts with qualifying facilities and independent power producers, the last of which ends in 2021. Capacity payments under the contracts are generally based on fixed dollar amounts per month, subject to escalation using broad-based economic indices. At December31,2015, the present value of Virginia Powers total commitment for capacity payments is $577 million. Capacity payments totaled $305 million, $330 million, and $345 million, and energy payments totaled $198 million, $304 million, and $236 million for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Lease Commitments The Companies lease various facilities, vehicles and equipment primarily under operating leases. Payments under certain leases are escalated based on an index such as the consumer price index. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December31,2015 are as follows: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Total (millions) Dominion $ 67 $ 62 $ 54 $ 43 $ 25 $ 153 $ 404 Virginia Power $ 30 $ 27 $ 23 $ 17 $ 14 $ 27 $ 138 Dominion Gas $ 26 $ 25 $ 23 $ 18 $ 6 $ 19 $ 117 Rental expense for Dominion totaled $99 million, $92 million, and $101 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Rental expense for Virginia Power totaled $51 million, $43 million, and $42 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Rental expense for Dominion Gas totaled $37 million, $35 million and $15 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of rental expense is reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Guarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit At December31,2015, Dominion had issued $74 million of guarantees, primarily to support equity method investees.No significant amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. As of December31,2015, Dominions exposure under these guarantees was $39 million, primarily related to certain reserve requirements associated with non-recourse financing.
Dominion also enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their commercial transactions with third parties. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominions consolidated subsidiaries, that liability is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion is not required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms of the guarantees typically end once obligations have been paid. Dominion currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries obligations.
At December31,2015, Dominion had issued the following subsidiary guarantees: StatedLimit Value (1) (millions) Subsidiary debt (2) $ 27 $ 27 Commodity transactions (3) 2,371 932 Nuclear obligations (4) 184 75 Cove Point (5) 1,910  Solar (6) 1,555 647 Other (7) 515 31 Total $ 6,562 $ 1,712 (1) Represents the estimated portion of the guarantees stated limit that is utilized as of December31,2015 based upon prevailing economic conditions and fact patterns specific to each guarantee arrangement. For those guarantees related to obligations that are recorded as liabilities by Dominions subsidiaries, the value includes the recorded amount.
153 Table of Contents Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Continued (2) Guarantee of debt of a DEI subsidiary. In the event of default by the subsidiary, Dominion would be obligated to repay such amounts.
(3) Guarantees related to commodity commitments of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiaries of Virginia Power, Dominion Gas and DEI. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, oil, electricity, pipeline capacity, transportation and related commodities and services. If any of these subsidiaries fail to perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment, Dominion would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. Dominion and its subsidiaries receive similar guarantees as collateral for credit extended to others. The value provided includes certain guarantees that do not have stated limits.
(4) Guarantees related to certain DEI subsidiaries potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed if there is a nuclear incident under Dominions nuclear insurance programs and guarantees for a DEI subsidiarys and Virginia Powers commitment to buy nuclear fuel. Excludes Dominions agreement to provide up to $150 million and $60 million to two DEI subsidiaries to pay the operating expenses of Millstone (in the event of a prolonged outage) and Kewaunee, respectively, as part of satisfying certain NRC requirements concerned with ensuring adequate funding for the operations of nuclear power stations. The agreement for Kewaunee also provides for funds through the completion of decommissioning.
(5) Guarantees related to Cove Point, in support of terminal services, transportation and construction. Two of the guarantees have no stated limit, one guarantee has a $150 million limit, and one guarantee has a $1.75 billion aggregate limit with an annual draw limit of $175 million.
(6) Includes guarantees to facilitate the development of solar projects including guarantees that do not have stated limits. Also includes guarantees entered into by DEI on behalf of certain subsidiaries to facilitate the acquisition and development of solar projects.
(7) Guarantees related to other miscellaneous contractual obligations such as leases, environmental obligations and construction projects. Also includes guarantees related to certain DEI subsidiaries obligations for equity capital contributions and energy generation associated with Fowler Ridge and NedPower. As of December31, 2015, Dominions maximum remaining cumulative exposure under these equity funding agreements is $55 million through 2019 and its maximum annual future contributions could range from approximately $4 million to $19 million. The value provided includes certain guarantees that do not have stated limits.
Additionally, at December31, 2015, Dominion had purchased $92 million of surety bonds, including $34 million at Virginia Power and $23 million at Dominion Gas, and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions of $59 million to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of surety bonds, the Companies are obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.
As of December31, 2015, Virginia Power had issued $14 million of guarantees primarily to support tax-exempt debt issued through conduits. The related debt matures in 2031 and is included in long-term debt in Virginia Powers Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default by a conduit, Virginia Power would be obligated to repay such amounts, which are limited to the principal and interest then outstanding.
Indemnifications As part of commercial contract negotiations in the normal course of business, the Companies may sometimes agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may involve an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretation of the tax law. The Companies are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of any other future payments under these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence. However, at December31,2015, the Companies believe any other future payments, if any, that could ultimately become payable under these contract provisions, would not have a material impact on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
N OTE 23. C REDIT R ISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if counterparties fail to perform their contractual obligations. In order to minimize overall credit risk, credit policies are maintained, including the evaluation of counterparty financial condition, collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties may make available collateral, including letters of credit or cash held as margin deposits, as a result of exceeding agreed-upon credit limits, or may be required to prepay the transaction.
The Companies maintain a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of their customers, historical trends and other information. Management believes, based on credit policies and the December31, 2015 provision for credit losses, that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance.
G ENERAL D OMINION As a diversified energy company, Dominion transacts primarily with major companies in the energy industry and with commercial and residential energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S. Dominion does not believe that this geographic concentration contributes significantly to its overall exposure to credit risk. In addition, as a result of its large and diverse customer base, Dominion is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk for receivables arising from electric and gas utility operations.
Dominions exposure to credit risk is concentrated primarily within its energy marketing and price risk management activities, as Dominion transacts with a smaller, less diverse group of counterparties and transactions may involve large notional volumes and potentially volatile commodity prices. Energy marketing and price risk management activities include marketing of merchant generation output, structured transactions and the use of financial contracts for enterprise-wide hedging purposes. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of any collateral. At December31,2015, Dominions credit exposure totaled $149 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 79%, and no single counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded $31 million of exposure.
V IRGINIA P OWER Virginia Power sells electricity and provides distribution and transmission services to customers in Virginia and northeastern 154 Table of Contents North Carolina. Management believes that this geographic concentration risk is mitigated by the diversity of Virginia Powers customer base, which includes residential, commercial and industrial customers, as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipalities. Credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable from energy consumers is limited due to the large number of customers. Virginia Powers exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers. Virginia Powers gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross credit exposure is calculated prior to the application of collateral. At December31, 2015, Virginia Powers exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk was not considered material.
D OMINION G AS Dominion Gas transacts mainly with major companies in the energy industry and with residential and commercial energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S. Dominion Gas does not believe that this geographic concentration contributes to its overall exposure to credit risk. In addition, as a result of its large and diverse customer base, Dominion Gas is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk for receivables arising from gas utility operations.
In 2015, DTI provided service to 266 customers with approximately 94% of its storage and transportation revenue being provided through firm services. The ten largest customers provided approximately 42% of the total storage and transportation revenue and the thirty largest provided approximately 72% of the total storage and transportation revenue.
East Ohio distributes natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio using rates established by the Ohio Commission. Approximately 98% of East Ohio revenues are derived from its regulated gas distribution services. East Ohios bad debt risk is mitigated by the regulatory framework established by the Ohio Commission. See Note 13 for further information about Ohios PIPP and UEX Riders that mitigate East Ohios overall credit risk.
C REDIT -R ELATED C ONTINGENT P ROVISIONS The majority of Dominions derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion to provide collateral upon the occurrence of specific events, primarily a credit downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were fully triggered as of December31, 2015 and 2014, Dominion would have been required to post an additional $12 million and $20 million, respectively, of collateral to its counterparties. The collateral that would be required to be posted includes the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives, non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. Dominion had posted no collateral at December31, 2015 and $1 million in collateral at December31, 2014, related to derivatives with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash. The collateral posted includes any amounts paid related to non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash as of December31, 2015 and 2014 was $49 million, which does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions. Credit-related contingent provisions for Virginia Power and Dominion Gas were not material as of December31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 7 for further information about derivative instruments.
N OTE 24. R ELATED - PARTY T RANSACTIONS Virginia Power and Dominion Gas engage in related party transactions primarily with other Dominion subsidiaries (affiliates). Virginia Powers and Dominion Gas receivable and payable balances with affiliates are settled based on contractual terms or on a monthly basis, depending on the nature of the underlying transactions. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas are included in Dominions consolidated federal income tax return. See Note 2 for further information.

Based on this evaluation process, Dominions CEO and CFO have concluded that Dominions disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Dominion continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as Dominion does throughout all aspects of its business.
Dominion maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Dominion, composed entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss auditing, internal control, and financial reporting matters of Dominion and to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have free access to the Committee at any time.
SEC rules implementing Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require Dominions 2015 Annual Report to contain a managements report and a report of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Dominion tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. Based on its assessment as of December31,2015, Dominion makes the following assertions: Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting of Dominion.
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
Management evaluated Dominions internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that Dominion maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015.

Richmond, Virginia We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (Dominion) as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Dominions management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Dominions internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Dominion maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2015 of Dominion and our report dated February26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

February26,2016 D OMINION G AS Senior management, including Dominion Gas CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of Dominion Gas disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, Dominion Gas CEO and CFO have concluded that Dominion Gas disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in Dominion Gas internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Dominion Gas internal control over financial reporting.
M ANAGEMENT  S A NNUAL R EPORT ON I NTERNAL C ONTROL O VER F INANCIAL R EPORTING Management of Dominion Gas understands and accepts responsibility for Dominion Gas financial statements and related disclosures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (internal control). Dominion Gas continuously strives to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control, just as it does throughout all aspects of its business.
Dominion Gas maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that its assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established procedures. This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and internal audits.
The Board of Directors also serves as Dominion Gas Audit Committee and meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to discuss Dominion Gas auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters and to ensure that each is properly discharging its responsibilities.
SEC rules implementing Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require Dominion Gas 2015 Annual Report to contain a managements report regarding the effectiveness of internal control. As a basis for the report, Dominion Gas tested and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. Based on the assessment as of December31,2015, Dominion Gas makes the following assertions: Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting of Dominion Gas.
165 Table of Contents There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.
Management evaluated Dominion Gas internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that Dominion Gas maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2015.
