2 Table of Contents PART I Item1 and 2.
Business and Properties General Devon Energy Corporation (Devon) is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our operations are concentrated in various North American onshore areas in the U.S. and Canada. We also own natural gas pipelines, plants and treatment facilities in many of our producing areas, making us one of North Americas larger processors of natural gas.
Devon pioneered the commercial development of natural gas from shale and coalbed formations, and we are a proven leader in using steam to produce oil from the Canadian oil sands. A Delaware corporation formed in 1971, we have been publicly held since 1988, and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Our principal and administrative offices are located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK 73102-8260 (telephone 405/235-3611). As of December31, 2011, we had approximately 5,200 employees.
Devon files or furnishes annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K as well as any amendments to these reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Through our website, http://www.devonenergy.com, we make available electronic copies of the documents we file or furnish to the SEC, the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors and other documents related to our corporate governance (including our Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer). Access to these electronic filings is available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the SEC. Printed copies of our committee charters or other governance documents and filings can be requested by writing to our corporate secretary at the address on the cover of this report.
In addition, the public may read and copy any materials Devon files with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington D.C. 20549.

Strategy We aspire to be the premier independent oil and natural gas company in North America and to provide our shareholders with top-quartile returns over the long-term. To achieve this, we strive to optimize our capital investments to maximize growth in cash flows, earnings, production and reserves, all on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We do this by:  exercising capital discipline,  maintaining superior financial strength,  investing in oil and gas properties with strong full-cycle margins, and  balancing our production and resource mix between natural gas and liquids.
Growth in cash flow per debt-adjusted share has the greatest long-term correlation to share price appreciation. As a result, we focus on capital investments that sustain and accelerate growth per debt-adjusted share. In an environment that involves challenged natural gas prices and more robust liquids prices, our capital allocation is focused on liquids-based resource capture and development. Our portfolio strikes a good balance between oil, NGLs and natural gas with a cost structure that generates highly competitive full-cycle returns. Within our portfolio, we have a deep inventory of repeatable opportunities diversified across several key resource plays. We also have significant exposure to several emerging plays and new venture opportunities. Finally, the recent divestiture of our offshore operations generated about $8 billion in after-tax proceeds. We used a portion of these proceeds to repurchase $3.5 billion of our common stock and repay debt, giving us one of the strongest balance sheets in our peer group.
3 Table of Contents Oil and Gas Properties Property Profiles The locations of our key properties are presented on the following map. These properties include those that currently have significant proved reserves and production, as well as properties that do not currently have significant levels of proved reserves or production but are expected to be the source of significant future growth in proved reserves and production.

U.S.
Barnett Shale This is our largest property both in terms of production and proved reserves. Our leases are located primarily in Denton, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties in north Texas. The Barnett Shale is a non-conventional reservoir, producing natural gas and NGLs.
We are the largest producer in the Barnett Shale. Since acquiring a substantial position in this field in 2002, we continue to introduce technology and new innovations to enhance production and have transformed this into one of the top producing gas fields in North America. We have drilled nearly 5,000 wells in the Barnett Shale since 2002, yet we still have several thousand remaining drilling locations. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 300 wells.
In addition, we have a significant processing plant and gathering system in North Texas to service these properties. Currently, these midstream assets include over 3,000 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity and a 15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To meet increasing demand from our liquids-rich development drilling, we intend to increase the size of our inlet processing capacity to 890 MMcf per day by early 2013.
5 Table of Contents Cana-Woodford Shale Our acreage is located primarily in Oklahomas Canadian, Blaine, Caddo, and Dewey counties. The Cana-Woodford Shale is a non-conventional reservoir and produces natural gas, NGLs and condensate.
The Cana-Woodford is a leading growth area for Devon and has rapidly emerged as one of the most economic shale plays in North America. We are the largest leaseholder and the largest producer in the Cana-Woodford. During 2011, we increased our production by 85%. We have several thousand remaining drilling locations. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 200 wells.
In addition, we have constructed a gas processing plant with 200 MMcf per day of total capacity. To meet increasing demand from our development drilling, we intend to increase the size of our plant to 350 MMcf per day by mid-2013.
Permian Basin These properties have been a legacy asset for us and continue to offer both exploration and low-risk development opportunities. Our acreage is located in various counties in west Texas and southeast New Mexico. Our current drilling activity is targeting conventional and non-conventional liquids-rich targets within the Conventional Delaware, Bone Spring, Wolfcamp, Wolfberry and Avalon Shale plays. In 2012, we plan to drill more than 300 wells.
Carthage Our acreage is located primarily in Harrison, Marion, Panola and Shelby counties in east Texas. These wells produce natural gas and NGLs from conventional reservoirs. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 35 wells.
Washakie These leases are concentrated in Wyomings Carbon and Sweetwater counties. The Washakie wells produce natural gas and NGLs from conventional reservoirs. Targeting the Almond and Lewis formations, we have been among the most active drillers in the Washakie basin for many years.
Granite Wash Our acreage is concentrated in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. These properties produce liquids and natural gas from conventional reservoirs. Our legacy land position in the Granite Wash is held by production and provides some of the best economics in our portfolio. High initial production rates and strong liquids yields contribute to the superior full-cycle rates of return. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 65 wells.
Arkoma-Woodford Shale Our acreage is located primarily in Coal and Hughes counties in southeastern Oklahoma. These properties produce natural gas and NGLs from a non-conventional reservoir. Our acreage in this play is held by production. In 2012, we do not plan to drill additional wells.
New Ventures During 2010 and 2011, we made significant acreage acquisitions targeting liquids rich production, including the following five exploration opportunities that we have publicly disclosed.
Michigan Basin  Our 340,000 acres are located in central Michigan and target oil and gas in the A1 Carbonate and Utica shale.
Mississippian  Our 230,000 acres are located in northern Oklahoma and target oil in the Mississippian Lime and Woodford shale.
Niobrara  Our 300,000 acres are located primarily in eastern Wyoming and target oil in the Niobrara, Turner, Cordell, Mowry, Frontier and Parkman plays. Currently, we are using 3D seismic to identify appropriate drilling zones.
Ohio Utica  Our 235,000 acres are located in Ohio and targets oil in the Utica shale.
Tuscaloosa  Our 265,000 acres are located in Louisiana and Mississippi and target oil and gas in the silica rich shale zone.
6 Table of Contents Additionally, in the first quarter of 2012, we expect to close our recently announced transaction in which our new partner will obtain a 33.3% interest in these new ventures properties for approximately $2.5 billion, including a $900 million payment at closing and $1.6 billion toward our share of future drilling costs. We will continue to de-risk the development of these properties with our partner by drilling approximately 125 wells in 2012.
Canada Jackfish Jackfish is our thermal heavy oil project in the non-conventional oil sands of east central Alberta. We are the first and only U.S.-based independent energy company to develop and operate an oil sands project in Canada. We are employing steam-assisted gravity drainage at Jackfish. The first phase of Jackfish is fully operational with a gross facility capacity of 35MBblsper day. The second phase of Jackfish began production in the second quarter of 2011 and will continue to increase production throughout 2012. Also, in 2011 we received regulatory approval for the construction of a third phase and will begin construction in 2012. We expect each phase to maintain a flat production profile for greater than 20 years at an average net production rate of approximately 25-30 MBbls per day.
To facilitate the delivery of our heavy oil production, we have a 50% interest in the Access Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This pipeline system allows us to blend our Jackfish heavy oil production with condensateor other blend-stock and transport the combined product to the Edmonton area for sale.
Northwest This region includes acreage in west central Alberta and northeast British Columbia. These properties produce liquids-rich natural gas and light gravity oil from conventional reservoirs. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 25 wells.
The region includes both winter-only and all season access areas. Multi-zone drilling opportunities are common. Since initial exploration in the 1970s, the region has seen significant infrastructure expansion. We own and operate gas gathering and processing facilities in the area, enabling projects to be brought on-stream quickly.
Deep Basin Our properties in Canadas Deep Basin include portions of west central Alberta and east central British Columbia. The area produces natural gas and liquids from conventional reservoirs. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 15 wells.
We are one of the major producers in the Deep Basin. We have used our large proprietary two-dimensional and three-dimensional seismic databases to build an extensive inventory of deep to mid-range drilling targets in this area. Most recently, we have been testing light oil targets in the Cardium formation and liquids-rich opportunities in the lower Cretaceous zones, including the Cadomin. The region has winter-only access restrictions in many areas, but offers year-round access in others. We control significant gas processing and transportation infrastructure throughout the region and hold interests in the only major gas facilities in the Wapiti area.
Lloydminster Our Lloydminster properties are located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by conventional means, without the need for steam injection. In 2012, we plan to drill approximately 150 wells.
The region is well-developed with significant infrastructure and is primarily accessible year-round for drilling. Lloydminster is a low-risk, high margin oil development play. We have drilled over 2,300 wells in the area since 2003.
Pike Our Pike oil sands acreage is situated directly to the south of our Jackfish acreage in east central Alberta and has similar reservoir characteristics to Jackfish. The Pike leasehold is currently undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of December31, 2011. We continued appraisal drilling in 2011 and will carry forward these activities into 2012. The results will help us determine the optimal configuration for the initial phase of development.
7 Table of Contents Proved Reserves For estimates of our proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the discussion of the contribution by each key property, see Note 22 to the financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency since the beginning of 2011 except in filings with the SEC and the Department of Energy (DOE). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not operate.
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. To be considered proved, oil and gas reserves must be economically producible before contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Also, the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report. As a result, we have developed internal policies for estimating and recording reserves. Such policies require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance. Our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the Group). These same policies also require that reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves estimators (Qualified Estimators), as defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers standards.
The Group, which is led by Devons Director of Reserves and Economics, is responsible for the internal review and certification of reserves estimates. We ensure the Groups Director and key members of the Group have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates, including any or all of the following:  an undergraduate degree in petroleum engineering from an accredited university, or equivalent;  a petroleum engineering license, or similar certification;  memberships in oil and gas industry or trade groups; and  relevant experience estimating reserves.
The current Director of the Group has all of the qualifications listed above. The current Director has been involved with reserves estimation in accordance with SEC definitions and guidance since 1987. He has experience in reserves estimation for projects in the U.S. (both onshore and offshore), as well as in Canada, Asia, the Middle East and South America. He has been employed by Devon for the past eleven years, including the past four in his current position. During his career with Devon and others, he was responsible for reserves estimation as the primary reservoir engineer for projects including, but not limited to:  Hugoton Gas Field (Kansas),  Sho-Vel-Tum CO 2 Flood (Oklahoma),  West Loco Hills Unit Waterflood and CO 2 Flood (New Mexico),  Dagger Draw Oil Field (New Mexico), 8 Table of Contents  Clarke Lake Gas Field (Alberta, Canada),  Panyu 4-2 and 5-1 Joint Development (Offshore South China Sea), and  ACG Unit (Caspian Sea).
From 2003 to 2010, he served as the reservoir engineering representative on our internal peer review team. In this role, he reviewed reserves and resource estimates for projects including, but not limited to the Mobile Bay Norphlet Discoveries (Gulf of Mexico Shelf), Cascade Lower Tertiary Development (Gulf of Mexico Deepwater) and Polvo Development (Campos Basin, Brazil).
The Group reports independently of any of our operating divisions. The Groups Director reports to our Vice President of Budget and Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer. No portion of the Groups compensation is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked.
Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each operating divisions reserves. Selection criteria of reserves that are audited include major fields and major additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum consultants discussed below. The Group also ensures our Qualified Estimators obtain continuing education related to the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.
The Group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed by third-party consulting firms. During 2011, we engaged two such firms to audit 95% of our proved reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the 2011 reserve estimates for 97% of our U.S. onshore properties. AJM Deloitte audited 89% of our Canadian reserves.
Audited reserves are those quantities of reserves that were estimated by our employees and audited by an independent petroleum consultant. The Society of Petroleum Engineers definition of an audit is an examination of a companys proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates, in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation methods and procedures.
In addition to conducting these internal and external reviews, we also have a Reserves Committee that consists of three independent members of our Board of Directors. This committee provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and certification process. The Reserves Committee assists the Board of Directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved reserves, much like our Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting requirements. Besides being independent, the members of our Reserves Committee also have educational backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering, as well as experience relevant to the reserves estimation process.
The Reserves Committee meets a minimum of twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies, and meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent petroleum consultants at those meetings. The responsibilities of the Reserves Committee include the following:  approve the scope of and oversee an annual review and evaluation of our oil, gas and NGL reserves;  oversee the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting system;  oversee and evaluate our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to our reserves;  review the qualifications and independence of our independent engineering consultants; and  monitor the performance of our independent engineering consultants.

The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs field personnel and performs other functions. We are the operator of approximately 24,000 of our wells. As operator, we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred to perform our duties, as well as monthly per-well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.
Acreage Statistics The following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped lease and mineral acreage as of December31, 2011. The acreage in the table includes 0.6million, 1.2million and 0.5million net acres subject to leases that are scheduled to expire during 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

11 Table of Contents Title to Properties Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business.
As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review of local records, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties.
Marketing and Midstream Activities The primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such services by gathering, processing and marketing oil, gas and NGL production timely and efficiently.
Our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by:  selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for marketing, and  selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport pipelines and unrelated third-party pipelines.
Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily incurred from:  purchasing the gas streams entering our transport pipelines and plants;  purchasing fuel needed to operate our plants, compressors and related pipeline facilities;  purchasing third-party NGLs;  operating our plants, gathering systems and related facilities; and  transporting products on unrelated third-party pipelines.
Oil, Gas and NGL Marketing The spot markets for oil, gas and NGLs are subject to volatility as supply and demand factors fluctuate. As detailed below, we sell our production under both long-term (one year or more) and short-term (less than one year) agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Regardless of the term of the contract, the vast majority of our production is sold at variable, or market-sensitive, prices.
Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixed-price contracts associated with a portion of our oil and gas production. These activities are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations. See Note 2 to the financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further information.
As of January 2012, our production was sold under the following contracts.
Short-Tem Long-Tem Variable Fixed Variable Fixed Oil 77 %  23 %  Natural gas 84 %  16 %  NGLs 69 % 10 % 21 %  12 Table of Contents Delivery Commitments A portion of our production is sold under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. As of January 2012, we were committed to deliver the following fixed quantities of production.

NGLs are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.
We expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next three years with production from our proved developed reserves. We expect to fulfill our longer-term delivery commitments beyond three years primarily with our proved developed reserves. In certain regions, we expect to fulfill these longer-term delivery commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves.
Our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments during the three most recent years, and we expect such reserves will continue to satisfy our future commitments. However, should our proved reserves not be sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments, we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments.
Customers During 2011, 2010 and 2009, no purchaser accounted for over 10% of our revenues.
Competition See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Public Policy and Government Regulation The oil and natural gas industry is subject to various types of regulation throughout the world. Laws, rules, regulations and other policy implementations affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to public policy changes, numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production, marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Because public policy changes affecting the oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and natural gas companies of similar size and financial strength. The following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations.
Exploration and Production Regulation Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to matters that include, but are not limited to:  acquisition of seismic data; 13 Table of Contents  location, drilling and casing of wells;  hydraulic fracturing;  well production;  spill prevention plans;  emissions and discharge permitting;  use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations;  surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled;  calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes;  plugging and abandoning of wells; and  transportation of production.
Our operations also are subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In the U.S., some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands.
Royalties and Incentives in Canada The royalty system in Canada is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and gas production. Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production, with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical location and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time, the federal and provincial governments of Canada also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays, tax credits and fixed rate and profit-sharing royalties for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues, earnings and cash flow.
Pricing and Marketing in Canada Any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain export authorizations from Canadas National Energy Board (NEB). The governments of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere.
14 Table of Contents Environmental and Occupational Regulations We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal and local laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. Environmental laws and regulations relate to, among other things:  assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition, drilling or construction activities;  the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials;  the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere;  the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well and other sites, including sites of former operations; and  the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans.
We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with environmental, safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and will likely continue to increase. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.
Item1A.
Risk Factors Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted. As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon.
Oil, Gas and NGL Prices are Volatile Our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. A significant downward movement of the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating cash flows and profitability. Such a downward price movement could also have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, the level of planned drilling activities and future growth. Historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:  consumer demand for oil, gas and NGLs;  conservation efforts;  OPEC production levels;  weather;  regional pricing differentials;  differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude);  differing quality and NGL content of gas produced;  the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs;  the price and availability of alternative fuels;  the overall economic environment; and  governmental regulations and taxes.
15 Table of Contents Estimates of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors including additional development activity, the viability of production under varying economic conditions and variations in production levels and associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our financial condition and profitability. Our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties of this report.
Discoveries or Acquisitions of Reserves are Needed to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production The production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase, due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells, secondary or tertiary recovery techniques, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.
Future Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve Substantial Costs Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:  unexpected drilling conditions;  pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;  equipment failures or accidents;  fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;  adverse weather conditions;  lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods;  environmental hazards or liabilities; and  shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment.
A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
16 Table of Contents Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be Significant Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Typically, during times of high or rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. Higher prices will also generally increase the cost to acquire properties. Certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than ours. They also may have established strategic long-term positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations.
Midstream Capacity Constraints and Interruptions Impact Commodity Sales We rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our natural gas production and to transport our production to downstream markets. Such midstream systems include the systems we operate, as well as systems operated by third parties. When possible, we gain access to midstream systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market prices available to us. Regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon, a portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems. Such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. Additionally, we and third-parties may be subject to constraints that limit our ability to construct, maintain or repair midstream facilities needed to process and transport our production. Such interruptions or constraints could negatively impact our production and associated profitability.
Hedging Limits Participation in Commodity Price Increases and Increases Counterparty Credit Risk Exposure We periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and NGL price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts.
Public Policy, Which Includes Laws, Rules and Regulations, Can Change Our operations are generally subject to federal laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, we are also subject to the laws and regulations of various states, provinces, tribal and local governments. Pursuant to public policy changes, numerous government departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Changes in such public policy have affected, and at times in the future could affect, our operations. Political developments can restrict production levels, enact price controls, change environmental protection requirements, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies. Existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance. Our operating and other compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to hydraulic fracturing, income taxes and climate change as discussed below.
17 Table of Contents Hydraulic Fracturing The U.S. Department of the Interior is considering the possibility of additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. Currently, regulation of hydraulic fracturing is conducted primarily at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. We lease federal lands and would be affected by the Interior Department proposal if it were to become law.
Income Taxes We are subject to federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of income taxes we must pay. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. Changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types costs that are considered allowable deductions or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings would all impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow. The U.S. Presidents budget proposals include provisions that would, if enacted, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. The most significant change to our business would eliminate the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs.
Climate Change Policy makers in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to harmful climatic changes. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state level have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories and limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative initiatives to date have focused on the development of cap-and-trade programs. These programs generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. Cap-and-trade programs would be relevant to our operations because the equipment we use to explore for, develop, produce and process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases. Additionally, the combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as the oil, gas and NGLs we sell, emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Environmental Matters and Costs Can Be Significant As an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from our operations in affected areas. Any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. There is no assurance that changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.
Insurance Does Not Cover All Risks Our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, development, production, processing and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Such risks include potential blowouts, cratering, fires, loss of well control, mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in environmental pollution, damage to or destruction of our property, equipment and natural resources, injury to person or loss of life. Additionally, for our non-operated properties, we generally depend on the operator for operational safety and regulatory compliance.
To mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. We also maintain workers compensation and employers liability insurance. However, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards. Additionally, insurance coverage is generally not available to us for pollution events that are considered gradual, and we have 18 Table of Contents limited or no insurance coverage for certain risks such as political risk, war and terrorism. Our insurance does not cover penalties or fines assessed by governmental authorities. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.
Limited Control on Properties Operated by Others Certain of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. We have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations or the amount of required future capital expenditures. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these properties could result in unexpected future costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis presents managements perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Overview of Business As an enterprise, we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flows, earnings, production and reserves, all on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We accomplish this by executing our strategy, which is outlined in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties of this report Overview of 2011 Results 2011 was an outstanding year for Devon. We generated record net earnings, increased proved reserves to an all-time high and completed our highly successful strategic repositioning, transforming us into a pure North American onshore company. We have now essentially completed our offshore divestiture program. In aggregate, the divestiture program generated after-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion, assuming the repatriation of a substantial portion of the foreign proceeds under current U.S. tax law. We also completed our $3.5 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As we have increased our focus on the vast opportunities in our North American onshore portfolio of properties, we are seeing improvements in key measures of our performance, including growth in liquids 23 Table of Contents production and cash flow, both on a per share debt-adjusted basis, which is key to maximizing shareholder value. Key measures of our 2011 production performance, as well as certain other financial measures and operational developments, are summarized below:  North America Onshore liquids production grew 15% over 2010, to 223 MBoe per day.
North America Onshore gas production increased 4% compared with 2010, to 2,610 MMcf per day.
The combined realized price for oil, gas and NGLs per Boe increased 9% to $34.64.
Oil, gas and NGL derivatives generated net gains of $881 million in 2011, including cash receipts of $392 million.
Per unit lease operating costs increased 4% to $7.71 per Boe.
Operating cash flow increased to $6.2 billion, representing a 14% increase over 2010.
Capitalized costs incurred in our oil and gas activities totaled $6.9 billion in 2011. This includes approximately $1.5 billion for acreage acquisitions and exploration activity.
Reserves reached an all-time high of 3,005 MMBoe.
Fourth Quarter Operational Developments  We increased our fourth-quarter liquids production by 21 percent compared to the year-ago period, to 238,000 barrels per day.
This liquids growth drove our production ten percent higher than the year-ago quarter to a record 680,000 equivalent barrels per day.
In the fourth-quarter, our exploration and production capital totaled $1.9 billion. This amount includes approximately $400 million of opportunistic leasehold acquisition, consisting of acreage additions in the Ohio Utica and leasehold capture in an undisclosed, new oil opportunity.
In the Permian Basin, we increased oil and natural gas liquids production 22 percent compared to the fourth-quarter 2010. Liquids production accounted for nearly 75 percent of the 53,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the Permian Basin during the quarter.
We completed eight operated Bone Spring wells within the Permian Basin in the fourth quarter. Initial daily production from these wells averaged more than 600 Boe per day per well.
In total, net production from our Jackfish 1 and Jackfish 2 projects averaged a record 43,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, representing a 91 percent increase over the year-ago quarter. Our Jackfish 2 production exited the fourth quarter at 14,000 barrels per day and will continue to ramp-up throughout 2012.
In early December, we received regulatory approval for our third 35,000 barrel per day Jackfish project. We have begun construction with plant startup targeted for late 2014.
Immediately adjacent to Jackfish, we are currently drilling appraisal wells and acquiring seismic on our Pike oil sands lease to determine the optimal development plan. In total, we expect Pike will support up to five 35,000 barrel per day projects.
Fourth-quarter production from our Cana-Woodford Shale play in western Oklahoma increased 83 percent over the fourth quarter of 2010. Net production averaged a record 250million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, including 3,100 barrels of oil and 7,400 barrels per day of natural gas liquids.
Our Barnett Shale production averaged a record 1.32 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2011, an 11 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. Liquids production accounted for 21 percent of total production, averaging 47,000 barrels per day during the quarter.
24 Table of Contents  We brought six operated Granite Wash wells online in the fourth quarter. Initial production from these wells averaged 1,300 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Fourth-quarter production from our Granite Wash play reached 19,100 barrels per day, a 47 percent increase over 2010.
Business and Industry Outlook We possess a great deal of financial strength and flexibility and are fully committed to exercising capital discipline, maximizing profits, maintaining balance sheet strength and optimizing growth per debt-adjusted share. Our portfolio of assets provides a great deal of investment flexibility. We expect gas prices will remain challenged in the market throughout 2012. Therefore, our near-term focus is on the oil and liquids-rich opportunities that exist within our balanced portfolio of properties. The vast majority of our 2012 drilling activity will be centered on our oil and liquids-rich gas properties. Should the outlook for commodity prices change, we have the flexibility to redirect our capital to ensure we continually focus on the highest-return assets in our portfolio.
Additionally, our financial and operational flexibility will be further enhanced by the transaction that we announced in early 2012 with Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration& Production Corporation, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2012. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Sinopec will pay $2.5 billion, including a $900 million payment at closing and $1.6 billion toward our share of future drilling costs, and will receive a 33.3% interest in five of our new venture plays.
Our ability to leverage the depth and breadth of our existing portfolio of properties will be important to successfully achieve our growth and value-creation objectives. With 3,005 MMBoe of proved reserves at the end of 2011, our assets will provide many years of visible, economic growth and a good balance between liquids and natural gas. In 2012, we are targeting a 6 percent production increase, which will be fueled by liquids growth approaching 20%.
Results of Operations All amounts in this document related to our International operations are presented as discontinued. Therefore, the production, revenue and expense amounts presented in this Results of Operations section exclude amounts related to our International assets unless otherwise noted.
Even though we divested our U.S. Offshore operations in 2010, these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules. As such, financial and operating data provided in this document that pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to our U.S. Offshore operations. To facilitate comparisons of our ongoing operations subsequent to the planned divestitures, we have presented amounts related to our U.S. Offshore assets separate from those of our North American Onshore assets where appropriate.

The volume and price changes in the tables above caused the following changes to our oil, gas and NGL sales.
Oil Gas NGLs Total (In millions) 2009 sales $ 2,153 $ 3,197 $ 747 $ 6,097 Changes due to volumes (67 ) (122 ) 46 (143 ) Changes due to prices 557 497 254 1,308 2010 sales 2,643 3,572 1,047 7,262 Changes due to volumes 268 88 147 503 Changes due to prices 488 (249 ) 311 550 2011 sales $ 3,399 $ 3,411 $ 1,505 $ 8,315 Oil Sales 2011 vs. 2010 Oil sales increased $488 million in 2011 as a result of a 17 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. The largest contributor to the higher realized price was an increase in the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate price.
Oil sales increased $268 million due to a 10 percent increase in production. The increase in production was driven by the continued development of our Permian Basin properties and our Jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in Canada. This increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010.
27 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Oil sales increased $557 million as a result of a 27 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. The largest contributor to the higher realized price was an increase in the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate index price.
Oil sales decreased $67 million due to a 3 percent production decline. The decrease was comprised of the net effects of a 62 percent decrease in our U.S. Offshore production and a 5 percent increase in our North America Onshore production. The decrease in our U.S. Offshore production was primarily due to the divestiture of such properties in the second quarter of 2010. The increased North America Onshore production resulted primarily from continued development of our Permian Basin properties and our Jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in Canada.
Gas Sales 2011 vs. 2010 Gas sales decreased $249 million in 2011 as a result of a 7 percent decrease in our realized price without hedges. The change in price was largely due to fluctuations of the North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.
Gas sales increased $88 million due to a 2 percent increase in production. The increased production resulted primarily from continued development activities in the Barnett and Cana-Woodford Shales, partially offset by natural declines in our other operating areas. This increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010.
2010 vs. 2009 Gas sales increased $497 million as a result of a 16 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. This increase was largely due to higher North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.
Gas sales decreased $122 million due to a 4 percent decrease in production. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010. Also, our North American Onshore properties decreased 1 percent due to reduced drilling during most of 2009 in response to lower gas prices.
NGL Sales 2011 vs. 2010 NGL sales increased $311 million in 2011 due to a 26 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. The higher price was largely due to an increase in the Mont Belvieu, Texas hub price.
NGL sales increased $147 million in 2011 due to a 14 percent increase in production. The increased production was primarily due to increased drilling in our Barnett Shale, Cana-Woodford Shale and Granite Wash locations.
2010 vs. 2009 NGL sales increased $254 million in 2010 as a result of a 32 percent increase in our realized price. The higher price was largely due to an increase in the Mont Belvieu, Texas hub price.
NGL sales increased $46 million in 2010 due to a 6 percent increase in production. The increase in production was primarily due to increased drilling in our North American Onshore areas that have liquids-rich gas.
Oil, Gas and NGL Derivatives The following tables provide financial information associated with our oil, gas and NGL hedges. The first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Our oil, gas and NGL derivatives include price swaps, costless collars and basis swaps. For the price swaps, we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, we cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars. For the basis swaps, we receive a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments.
29 Table of Contents Also, to facilitate a portion of our price swaps, we sold gas call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012. The call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.
In addition to cash settlements, we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil, gas and NGL derivative instruments in each reporting period. The changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred during each period, as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves. Including the cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives generated net gains of $881 million, $811 million and $384 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

2011 vs. 2010 LOE increased $0.29 per Boe in 2011. LOE increased $0.39 per Boe, excluding the U.S. Offshore operations that were sold in the second quarter of 2010. The largest contributor to the higher North America Onshore unit cost is our oil production growth, particularly at our Jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in 30 Table of Contents Canada. Such oil projects generally require a higher cost to produce per unit than our gas projects. We also experienced upward pressures on costs in certain operating areas, which increased LOE per Boe. Additionally, LOE per Boe increased $0.15 due to a $36 million increase from changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.
2010 vs. 2009 LOE increased $0.26 per Boe in 2010. LOE increased $0.45 per Boe, excluding costs associated with our U.S. Offshore operations. LOE per Boe increased $0.34 due to a $78 million increase from changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. The remainder of the increase in North America Onshore LOE per Boe was primarily due to increased costs related to our Jackfish operation in Canada.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) Year Ended December31, 2011 2011vs.
2010(1) 2010 2010vs.
2009(1) 2009 DD&A ($ in millions): Oil& gas properties $ 1,987 +19 % $ 1,675 9 % $ 1,832 Other properties 261 +2 % 255 8 % 276 Total $ 2,248 +17 % $ 1,930 8 % $ 2,108 DD&A per Boe: Oil& gas properties $ 8.28 +13 % $ 7.36 6 % $ 7.86 Other properties $ 1.09 3 % $ 1.12 5 % $ 1.18 Total $ 9.37 +10 % $ 8.48 6 % $ 9.04 (1) Percentage changes are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.
A description of how DD&A of our oil and gas properties is calculated is included in Note 1 to the financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Generally, when reserve volumes are revised up or down, then the DD&A rate per unit of production will change inversely. However, when the depletable base changes, then the DD&A rate moves in the same direction. The per unit DD&A rate is not affected by production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A, as opposed to the rate per unit of production, generally moves in the same direction as production volumes.
2011 vs. 2010 Oil and gas property DD&A increased $221 million during 2011 due to a 13 percent increase in the DD&A rate and $91 million due to our 5 percent increase in production. The largest contributors to the higher rate were our 2011 drilling and development activities and changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. These increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010.
2010 vs. 2009 Oil and gas property DD&A decreased $114 million during 2010 due to a 6 percent decrease in the DD&A rate and $43 million due to our 2 percent decline in production. The largest contributors to the rate decrease were our 2010 U.S. Offshore property divestitures and a $6.4 billion reduction of the carrying value of our U.S. oil and gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the effects of costs incurred and transfers of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of our 2010 drilling and development activities, as well as changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.

2011 vs. 2010 Net G&A increased during 2011 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits, while net G&A per Boe slightly declined as we grew production at a higher rate than G&A.
2010 vs. 2009 Net G&A on an absolute and per Boe basis decreased largely due to a decline in employee severance costs. Such costs decreased primarily due to employees that were impacted by the integration of our offshore operations into one unit in 2009. In addition, net G&A decreased subsequent to our mid-year 2010 offshore divestitures as a result of the decline in our workforce.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Year Ended December31, 2011 2011vs.

Taxes other than income taxes increased in each period primarily due to an increase in our U.S. Onshore revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed.
Interest Expense Year Ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Interest based on debt outstanding $ 414 $ 408 $ 437 Capitalized interest (72 ) (76 ) (94 ) Early retirement of debt  19  Other 10 12 6 Total $ 352 $ 363 $ 349 32 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Interest expense decreased primarily due to costs associated with the early retirement of our $350 million notes in 2010. This was partially offset by higher interest resulting from increased debt balances in 2011.
2010 vs. 2009 Interest expense increased due to costs associated with the early retirement of debt discussed above and a decrease in our capitalized interest. The decrease in capitalized interest resulted primarily from the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in 2010. These increases were partially offset by lower interest on our debt balances resulting from the retirement of $350 million of notes in 2010 and $177 million of notes in 2009.
Restructuring Costs YearEndedDecember31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Cash severance $ 9 $ (17 ) $ 66 Share-based awards (1 ) (10 ) 39 Lease obligations (13 ) 70  Asset impairments 2 11  Other 1 3  Total(1) $ (2 ) $ 57 $ 105 (1) Restructuring costs related to our discontinued operations totaled $(2) million, $(4) million, and $48 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These costs primarily consist of employee severance and are not included in the table.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we announced plans to divest our offshore assets. As of December31, 2011, we had divested all of our U.S. Offshore assets and substantially all of our International assets. Through the end of 2011, we had incurred $202 million of restructuring costs associated with these divestitures.
Employee Severance This amount was originally based on estimates of the number of employees that would ultimately be impacted by the offshore divestitures and included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of share-based grants. As the divestiture program progressed, we decreased our overall estimate of employee severance costs. More offshore employees than previously estimated received comparable positions with either the purchaser of the properties or in our U.S. Onshore operations.
Lease Obligations As a result of the divestitures, we ceased using certain office space that was subject to non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Consequently, in 2010 we recognized $70 million of restructuring costs that represented the present value of our future obligations under the leases, net of anticipated sublease income. Our estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases. These estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases, as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases.
In addition, we recognized $11 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space that we ceased using.
Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties In the first quarter of 2009, we reduced the carrying value of our U.S. oil and gas properties $6.4 billion, or $4.1 billion after taxes, due to a full cost ceiling limitation. The lower ceiling value largely resulted from the 33 Table of Contents effects of declining natural gas prices subsequent to December31, 2008. To demonstrate the decline, the March31, 2009 and December31, 2008 weighted average wellhead prices are presented in the following table.

Accordingly, we recognized deferred income tax expense of $725 million, $144 million and $55 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to assumed repatriations of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.

The following table presents gains on our divestiture transactions by year. Also, in 2009 we reduced the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in Brazil by $109 million due to full cost ceiling limitation resulting from drilling results at the BM-BAR-3 offshore block.

Our operating cash flow increased 24 percent in spite of the $454 million of discretionary contributions made to our pension plans in 2011. The increase was largely due to higher current income taxes in 2010 associated with taxable gains on our U.S. Offshore divestitures and higher commodity prices and production, partially offset by lower realized gains from our commodity derivatives.
During 2011, 2010 and 2009 our operating cash flow funded 83%, 78% and 87% of our cash payments for capital expenditures. As needed, we supplement our operating cash flow and available cash by reducing short-term investment balances or accessing available credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program. We may also issue long-term debt to supplement our operating cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities. Additionally, we may acquire short-term investments to maximize our income on available cash balances.
Debt Activity, Net During 2011, we increased our commercial paper borrowings by $3.7 billion and received $0.5 billion from new debt issuances, net of debt maturities. Proceeds were primarily used to fund capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in excess of operating cash flow.
During 2010, we repaid $1.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings and redeemed our $350 million notes, primarily with proceeds received from our U.S. Offshore divestitures.
During 2009, we increased our commercial paper borrowings by $400 million and our term debt $1.0 billion, net of maturities. These proceeds were primarily used to fund capital expenditures in excess of our operating cash flow.
Divestitures of Property and Equipment The following table presents the components of our divestiture transactions.

The vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties, which totaled $6.7 billion, $5.9 billion and $4.3 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increases in exploration and development capital spending in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to new venture acreage acquisitions, the 2010 $500 million Pike oil sands acquisition and increased drilling and development. With rising oil prices and proceeds from our offshore divestitures, we have increased our acreage positions and associated exploration and development activities to drive near-term growth of our onshore liquids production.
The increase in North American Onshore exploration and development capital spending in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the $500 million Pike oil sands acquisition and increased drilling primarily to grow liquids production.
Capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants, natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines. Our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling activities. Therefore, the increase in development drilling also increased midstream capital activities.
Capital expenditures related to other activities increased in 2011. This increase is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in Oklahoma City.
Common Stock Repurchases and Dividends The following table summarizes our repurchases, including unsettled shares, and our common stock dividends (amounts and shares in millions).
2011 2010 2009 Amount Shares PerShare Amount Shares PerShare Amount Shares PerShare Repurchases $ 2,299 30.9 $ 74.49 $ 1,201 18.3 $ 65.58 $ N/A N/A $ N/A Dividends $ 278 N/A $ 0.67 $ 281 N/A $ 0.64 $ 284 N/A $ 0.64 In connection with our offshore divestitures, we conducted a $3.5 billion share repurchase program that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under the program, we repurchased 49.2million shares, representing 11% of our outstanding shares, at an average price of $71.18 per share.
37 Table of Contents Short-Term Investment Activity, Net During 2011, we had net short-term investment purchases totaling $1.3 billion. These purchases represent our investment of a portion of the International offshore divestiture proceeds into commercial paper, U.S. and Canadian Treasury securities and other marketable securities.
Liquidity Historically, our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow and cash on hand. Additionally, we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. Other available sources of capital and liquidity include debt and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. We estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures, debt repayments and other contractual commitments as discussed in this section.
Operating Cash Flow Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil, gas and NGLs we produce. Due to higher liquids production and prices, our operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 24 percent to $6.2 billion in 2011. We expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity.
Commodity Prices Prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control. We expect this volatility to continue throughout 2012.
To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we have utilized various derivative financial instruments to set minimum and maximum prices on our 2012 production. The key terms to our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of December31, 2011 are presented in Note 2 to the financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities. As a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also increase, causing a negative impact on our cash flow. However, the inverse is also true during periods of depressed commodity prices.
Interest Rates Our operating cash flow can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. As of December31, 2011, we had total debt of $9.8billion with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 4.0 percent. We have derivative financial instruments in place that reduce our weighted-average interest rate to 3.7 percent.
Credit Losses Our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. We are exposed to the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil, gas and NGL production. We are also exposed to credit risk related to the collection of receivables from our joint-interest partners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate. Additionally, we are exposed to the credit risk of counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. We utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, partners and counterparties. Such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayment requirements or collateral posting requirements.
As 2011, 2010 and 2009 demonstrate, we have a history of investing more than 100% of our operating cash flow into capital development activities to grow our company and maximize value for our shareholders. Therefore, negative movements in any of the variables discussed above would not only impact our operating cash flow, but also would likely impact the amount of capital investment we could or would make.
38 Table of Contents Credit Availability We have a $2.65 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving line of credit (the Senior Credit Facility) that can be accessed to provide liquidity as needed. The maturity date for $2.19 billion of the Senior Credit Facility is April7, 2013. The maturity date for the remaining $0.46 billion is April7, 2012. All amounts outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April7 anniversary date, we have the option to extend the maturity of the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of U.S. $0.5 billion.
Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at our election, bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally less than the prime rate. However, we may elect to borrow at the prime rate. As of February9, 2012, we had $1.8 billion of available capacity under our syndicated, unsecured Senior Credit Facility.
The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65 percent. The credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures, bonds, notes payable, credit facility borrowings and short-term commercial paper borrowings. In addition, total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil, gas and NGL production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment. Funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables. The credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns, such as full cost ceiling impairments. As of December31, 2011, we were in compliance with this covenant. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at December31, 2011, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 22.8 percent.
Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility is not restricted under any material adverse effect clauses. It is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses. These clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrowers financial condition, operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the borrowers ability to make timely debt payments, or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. While our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.
We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial paper program. In 2011, we increased our commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $5.0 billion. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market. As of February9, 2012, we had $3.1 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program.
Although we ended 2011 with approximately $7.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from our International offshore divestitures that are held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently expect to repatriate such amounts to the U.S. If we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash and short-term investments held by these foreign subsidiaries, we would be required to accrue and pay current income taxes in accordance with current U.S. tax law. With these proceeds remaining outside of the U.S., we expect to continue using commercial paper or credit facility borrowings in the U.S. to supplement our U.S. based operating cash flow. We do not expect near-term increases in such borrowings will have a material effect on our overall liquidity or financial condition.
39 Table of Contents Debt Ratings We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges. Our current debt ratings are BBB+ with a stable outlook by both Fitch and Standard& Poors, and Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moodys.
There are no rating triggers in any of our contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating. Therefore, even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities, it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the fully-drawn borrowing costs from LIBOR plus 35 basis points to a new rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. A ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the future. As of December31, 2011, we were not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.
Capital Expenditures Our 2012 capital expenditures are expected to range from $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion, including $5.5 billion to $5.9 billion for our oil and gas operations. To a certain degree, the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control. Therefore, if commodity prices fluctuate from our current estimates, we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2012 capital expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2012 to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. Based upon current price expectations for 2012, our existing commodity hedging contracts, available cash balances and credit availability, we anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2012 capital expenditures.
Additionally, our financial and operational flexibility will be further enhanced by the transaction that we announced in early 2012 with Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration& Production Corporation, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2012. Pursuant to the agreement, Sinopec will pay $2.5 billion, including a $900 million payment at closing and $1.6 billion toward our share of future drilling costs, and will receive a 33.3% interest in five of our new venture plays discussed in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties of this report.
The $900 million cash payment at closing will recoup more than 100% of our costs incurred up to the closing date. Additionally, the proceeds from this transaction will significantly reduce our future capital commitments. The drilling carry will fund 70 percent of our capital requirements related to these properties, which results in Sinopec paying 80 percent of the overall development costs during the carry period. This will allow us to accelerate the de-risking and commercialization of the five plays without diverting capital from our core development projects. We expect the entire $1.6 billion carry will be realized by the end of 2014.
40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations as of December31, 2011, is provided in the following table.
Payments Due by Period Total LessThan 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years MoreThan 5 Years (In millions) Debt(1) $ 9,786 $ 3,811 $ 500 $ 500 $ 4,975 Interest expense(2) 6,611 374 734 692 4,811 Purchase obligations(3) 8,454 900 1,810 1,829 3,915 Drilling and facility obligations(4) 1,475 919 556   Operational agreements(5) 2,136 306 585 459 786 Asset retirement obligations(6) 1,563 67 106 113 1,277 Lease obligations(7) 473 63 103 87 220 Other(8) 222 35 136 18 33 Total North America $ 30,720 $ 6,475 $ 4,530 $ 3,698 $ 16,017 (1) Debt amounts represent scheduled maturities of our debt obligations at December31, 2011, excluding $6 million of net discounts included in the carrying value of debt.
(2) Interest expense represents the scheduled cash payments on our long-term fixed-rate debt.
(3) Purchase obligation amounts represent contractual commitments to purchase condensate at market prices for use at our heavy oil projects in Canada. We have entered into these agreements because the condensate is an integral part of the heavy oil production process and any disruption in our ability to obtain condensate could negatively affect our ability to produce and transport heavy oil at these locations. Our total obligation related to condensate purchases expires in 2021. The value of the obligation in the table above is based on the contractual volumes and our internal estimate of future condensate market prices.
(4) Drilling and facility obligations represent contractual agreements with third-party service providers to procure drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities construction.
(5) Operational agreements represent commitments to transport or process certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed fee. We have entered into these agreements to aid the movement of our production to market.
(6) Asset retirement obligations represent estimated discounted costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs. These obligations are recorded as liabilities on our December31, 2011 balance sheet.
(7) Lease obligations consist primarily of non-cancelable leases for office space and equipment used in our daily operations.
(8) These amounts include $165 million related to uncertain tax positions. Future contributions to our qualified pension plans have not been included in the table above. During 2011, we made $454 million of contributions to our pension plans. Consequently, we expect required pension plan contributions will be insignificant for the foreseeable future.
41 Table of Contents Contingencies and Legal Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters, see Note 18 to the financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. We consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Full Cost Method of Accounting and Proved Reserves Our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the depletion and full cost ceiling calculations. Additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data. Our engineers prepare our reserve estimates. We then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by outside petroleum consultants. In 2011, 95% of our reserves were subjected to such audits.
The passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves, when revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five years, annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged less than 2 percent of the previous years estimate. However, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the associated prices of oil, gas and NGL reserves, and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. Applicable rules require future net revenues to be calculated using prices that represent the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period prior to the end of each quarterly period. Such rules also dictate that a 10 percent discount factor be used. Therefore, the discounted future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs or our enterprise risk.
Because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future prices and requires a 10 percent discount factor, the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves. Oil and gas prices have historically been cyclical and, for any particular 12-month period, can be either higher or lower than our long-term price forecast, which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair value. Therefore, oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.
Because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost writedowns. In addition, due to the inter-relationship of the various judgments made to estimate proved 42 Table of Contents reserves, it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates. However, decreases in estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our depletion rate and, thus, our depletion expense. Decreases in our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown.
Derivative Financial Instruments We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil, gas and NGL production that hedge the future prices received. Our commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options.
The estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment. We estimate the fair values of our commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations. The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices. We base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily upon implied volatility. The resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using U.S. Treasury bill rates. These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward prices and regional price differentials.
We periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility. Under the terms of our interest-rate swaps, we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount.
We estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yields. The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by third parties. The resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using the LIBOR and money market futures rates. These yield and discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward interest rate yields.
We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers.
Counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and derivative valuations. This is primarily the result of two factors. First, we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties. Our commodity derivative contracts are held with fourteen separate counterparties, and our interest rate derivative contracts are held with five separate counterparties. Second, our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterpartys credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels. The mark-to-market exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating falls further below such credit levels. Thresholds generally range from zero to $55 million for the majority of our contracts. As of December31, 2011, the credit ratings of all our counterparties were within our established guidelines.
Because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge accounting treatment, changes in the fair values of derivatives can have a significant impact on our reported results of operations. Generally, changes in derivative fair values will not impact our liquidity or capital resources.
Settlements of derivative instruments, regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations. Generally, if actual market prices are higher than the price of 43 Table of Contents the derivative instruments, our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments. The opposite is also true. Additional information regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial instruments, net earnings and cash flow from operations is included in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this report.
Goodwill The annual impairment test, which we conduct as of October31 each year, includes an assessment of qualitative factors and requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities. Because quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, we must estimate the fair values to conduct the goodwill impairment test. The most significant judgments involved in estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the valuation of our property and equipment. We develop estimated fair values of our property and equipment by performing various quantitative analyses using information related to comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
In our comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that are comparable to our respective reporting units. Such characteristics are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the characterization of the operations. In our comparable transactions analysis, we review certain acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages announced recently. In our premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected independent exploration and production company transactions in addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced recently. We then review the premiums paid to the price of the target one day and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction. We use this information to determine the median premiums paid.
We then use the comparable company multiples, comparable transaction multiples, transaction premiums and other data to develop valuation estimates of our property and equipment. We also use market and other data to develop valuation estimates of the other assets and liabilities included in our reporting units. At October31, 2011, the date of our last impairment test, the fair values of our U.S. and Canadian reporting units substantially exceeded their related carrying values.
A lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period.
Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.
Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. We recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. We routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that 44 Table of Contents some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We also assess factors relative to whether our foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Changes in any of these factors could require recognition of additional deferred, or even current, U.S. income tax expense. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters.
Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The following disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading.
Commodity Price Risk Our major market risk exposure is the pricing applicable to our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian gas and NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years as discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report. Consequently, we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our production through various financial transactions that hedge future prices received. The key terms to all our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of December31, 2011 are presented in Note 2 to the financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At December31, 2011, a 10 percent increase and 10 percent decrease in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net asset positions by the following amounts: 10%Increase 10%Decrease (In millions) Gain/(loss): Gas derivatives $ (93 ) $ 93 Oil derivatives $ (224 ) $ 215 Interest Rate Risk At December31, 2011, we had debt outstanding of $9.8 billion. Of this amount, $6.1 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 6.3 percent. Additionally, we had $3.7 billion of outstanding commercial paper, bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 0.45 percent. As of December31, 2011, we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in Note 2 to the financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
The fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR. A 10 percent change in these forward curves would not materially impact our balance sheet at December31, 2011.
45 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. A 10 percent unfavorable change in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our December31, 2011 balance sheet.
Our non-Canadian foreign subsidiaries have a U.S. dollar functional currency. However, one of these foreign subsidiaries holds Canadian-dollar cash and engages in short-term intercompany loans with Canadian subsidiaries that are sometimes based in Canadian dollars. Additionally, at December31, 2011, we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the Canadian-dollar cash. The increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Canadian-dollar cash. The value of the intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the loans into the U.S. dollar functional currency. Based on the amount of the intercompany loans as of December31, 2011, a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not materially impact our balance sheet.

47 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Devon Energy Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011. We also have audited Devon Energy Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Devon Energy Corporations management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report contained in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of Devon Energy Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

52 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Devon Energy Corporation (Devon) is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Devons operations are concentrated in various North American onshore areas in the U.S. and Canada. Devon also owns natural gas pipelines, plants and treatment facilities in many of its producing areas, making it one of North Americas larger processors of natural gas.
Accounting policies used by Devon and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect industry practices. The more significant of such policies are discussed below.
Principles of Consolidation The accounts of Devon and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries are included in the accompanying financial statements. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the following:  proved reserves and related present value of future net revenues;  the carrying value of oil and gas properties;  derivative financial instruments;  the fair value of reporting units and related assessment of goodwill for impairment;  income taxes;  asset retirement obligations;  obligations related to employee pension and postretirement benefits; and  legal and environmental risks and exposures.
Revenue Recognition and Gas Balancing Oil, gas and NGL sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is transferred when production has been delivered to a pipeline, railcar or truck. Cash received relating to future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on oil, gas and NGL sales are presented separately from such revenues in the accompanying comprehensive statements of earnings.
Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the properties. These differences 53 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) create imbalances that are recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The liability is priced based on current market prices. No receivables are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken less than its share of production unless all revenue recognition criteria are met. If an imbalance exists at the time the wells reserves are depleted, settlements are made among the joint interest owners under a variety of arrangements.
Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to oil, gas and NGL purchases, transportation and processing contracts are reported on a gross basis when Devon takes title to the products and has risks and rewards of ownership.
During 2011, 2010 and 2009, no purchaser accounted for more than 10 percent of Devons revenues from continuing operations.
Derivative Financial Instruments Devon is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including risks related to commodity prices, interest rates and Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rates. As discussed more fully below, Devon uses derivative instruments primarily to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk. Devon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production that hedge the future prices received. These instruments are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to commodity price volatility. Devons derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options. Under the terms of the price swaps, Devon receives a fixed price for its production and pays a variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pays a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars. The call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.
Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility. Devons interest rate swaps include contracts in which Devon receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate on a total notional amount.
All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivative financial instruments held during the three-year period ended December31, 2011, Devon chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify its derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment. Cash settlements with counterparties on Devons derivative financial instruments are also recorded in earnings.
By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices and interest rates, Devon is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of counterparties 54 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) whom Devon believes are minimal credit risks. It is Devons policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devons derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either its or the counterpartys credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below such credit levels. Thresholds generally range from zero to $55 million for the majority of Devons contracts. As of December31, 2011, the credit ratings of all Devons counterparties were within established guidelines.
General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.
Share Based Compensation Devon grants stock options, restricted stock awards and other types of share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors and selected employees. All such awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying comprehensive statements of earnings over the applicable requisite service periods. As a result of Devons strategic repositioning announced in 2009, certain share based awards were accelerated and recognized as a component of restructuring expense in the accompanying comprehensive statements of earnings.
Generally, Devon uses new shares from approved incentive programs to grant share-based awards and to issue shares upon stock option exercises. Shares repurchased under approved programs are available to be issued as part of Devons share based awards. However, Devon has historically cancelled these shares upon repurchase.
Income Taxes Devon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal and various state jurisdictions in the U.S. and by other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. If the future utilization of some portion of carryforwards is determined to be unlikely, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded tax benefits from such assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Devon does not recognize U.S.deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. When such earnings are no longer deemed permanently reinvested, Devon recognizes the appropriate deferred, or even current, income tax liabilities.
Devon recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. Recognized tax 55 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to such tax positions are included in other long-term liabilities unless the tax position is expected to be settled within the upcoming year, in which case the liabilities are included in other current liabilities. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in current income tax expense.
Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share Devons basic earnings per share amounts have been computed based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Basic earnings per share includes the effect of participating securities, which primarily consist of Devons outstanding restricted stock awards. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method to reflect the assumed issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities. Such securities primarily consist of outstanding stock options.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Devon considers all highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments Devon periodically invests excess cash in U.S. and Canadian Treasury securities and other marketable securities. During 2011, Devon invested a portion of the International offshore divestiture proceeds into such securities, causing short-term investments to increase.
Devon considers securities with original contractual maturities in excess of three months, but less than one year to be short-term investments. Investments with contractual maturities in excess of one year are classified as long-term, unless such investments are classified as trading or available-for-sale.
Devon reports its investments and other marketable securities at fair value, except for debt securities in which management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Such debt securities totaled $84 million and $94 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and are included in other long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet. Devon has the ability to hold the securities until maturity and does not believe the values of its long-term securities are impaired.
Property and Equipment Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs incurred that are directly identified with acquisition, exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for its own account, and that are not related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities, are also capitalized. Interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas properties under current evaluation and major development projects of oil and gas properties are also capitalized. All costs related to production activities, including workover costs incurred solely to maintain or increase levels of production from an existing completion interval, are charged to expense as incurred.
Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ceiling. The ceiling limitation is the estimated after-tax future net revenues, discounted at 10 percent per annum, from proved oil, gas and NGL reserves plus the cost of properties 56 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) not subject to amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas properties. Such limitations are tested quarterly and imposed separately on a country-by-country basis.
Future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period prior to the end of the period. Prices are held constant indefinitely and are not changed except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts, including derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. None of Devons derivative contracts held during the three-year period ended December31, 2011, qualified for hedge accounting treatment.
Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes, over the ceiling is written off as an expense. An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher commodity prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.
Capitalized costs are depleted by an equivalent unit-of-production method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is calculated using the capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement costs, plus the estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves, net of estimated salvage values.
Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved properties for impairment quarterly. Significant unproved properties are assessed individually. Costs of insignificant unproved properties are transferred into the depletion calculation over holding periods ranging from three to six years.
No gain or loss is recognized upon disposal of oil and gas properties unless such disposal significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in a particular country.
Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a unit-of-production basis. Depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment, including corporate and other midstream assets and leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to 39 years. Interest costs incurred and attributable to major midstream and corporate construction projects are also capitalized.
Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing well sites and midstream pipelines and processing plants when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. When the assumptions used to estimate a recorded asset retirement obligation change, a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. The asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment at least annually. Such test includes an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value, including goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.
57 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Because quoted market prices are not available for Devons reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarters of 2011, 2010 and 2009. Based on these assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.
The table below provides a summary of Devons goodwill, by assigned reporting unit. The decrease in Devons goodwill from 2010 to 2011 was due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.
December31, 2011 2010 (In millions) U.S.
$ 3,046 $ 3,046 Canada 2,967 3,034 Total $ 6,013 $ 6,080 Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for environmental remediation or restoration claims are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Expenditures related to such environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance with Devons accounting policy for property and equipment.
Fair Value Measurements Certain of Devons assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This price is commonly referred to as the exit price. Fair value measurements are classified according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques. This hierarchy consists of three broad levels:  Level 1  Inputs consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority. When available, Devon measures fair value using Level 1 inputs because they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.
Level 2  Inputs consist of quoted prices that are generally observable for the asset or liability. Common examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets not considered to be active.
Level 3  Inputs are not observable from objective sources and have the lowest priority. The most common Level 3 fair value measurement is an internally developed cash flow model.
Discontinued Operations As a result of the November 2009 plan to divest Devons offshore assets, all amounts related to Devons International operations are classified as discontinued operations. The Gulf of Mexico properties that were divested in 2010 do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting rules. As such, amounts in these notes and the accompanying financial statements that pertain to continuing operations include amounts related to Devons offshore Gulf of Mexico operations.
58 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) The captions assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheets present the assets and liabilities associated with Devons discontinued operations. Devon measures its assets held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, Devon does not recognize depreciation, depletion and amortization on its long-lived assets held for sale.
Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devons consolidated operations except its Canadian subsidiaries, which use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Devons Canadian subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Canadian income and expenses are translated at average rates for the periods presented. Translation adjustments have no effect on net income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings in stockholders equity.

Share-Based Compensation On June3, 2009, Devons stockholders adopted the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which expires on June2, 2019. This plan authorizes the Compensation Committee, which consists of independent non-management members of Devons Board of Directors, to grant nonqualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, performance 60 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) restricted stock awards, Canadian restricted stock units, performance share units, stock appreciation rights and cash-out rights to eligible employees. The plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to directors. A total of 21.5million shares of Devon common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the plan. To calculate shares issued under the plan, options granted represent one share and other awards represent 1.84 shares.
Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2005, 2003 and 1997 under which stock options and restricted stock awards were issued to certain management and professional employees. Options granted under these plans remain exercisable by the employees owning such options, but no new options or restricted stock awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has stock options outstanding that were assumed as part of its 2003 acquisition of Ocean Energy.
The following table presents the effects of share-based compensation included in Devons accompanying comprehensive statements of earnings. The vesting for certain share-based awards was accelerated as part of Devons strategic repositioning. The associated expense for these accelerated awards is included in restructuring costs in the accompanying comprehensive statements of earnings. See Note 4 for further details.
2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Gross general and administrative expense $ 181 $ 188 $ 209 Share-based compensation expense capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties $ 56 $ 58 $ 66 Related income tax benefit $ 33 $ 40 $ 43 Stock Options In accordance with Devons incentive plans, the exercise price of stock options granted may not be less than the market value of the stock at the date of grant. In addition, options granted are exercisable during a period established for each grant, which may not exceed eight years from the date of grant. The recipient must pay the exercise price in cash or in common stock, or a combination thereof, at the time that the option is exercised. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years.
The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the fair values of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires Devon to make several assumptions. The volatility of Devons common stock is based on the historical volatility of the market price of Devons common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option and ending on the grant date. The dividend yield is based on Devons historical and current yield in effect at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield for the expected term of the option at the date of grant. The expected term of the options is based on historical exercise and termination experience for various groups of employees and directors. Each group is determined based on the similarity of their historical exercise and termination behavior. The following table presents a summary of the grant-date fair values of stock options granted and the related assumptions. All such amounts represent the weighted-average amounts for each year.

As of December31, 2011, Devons unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was $70 million. Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.
Restricted Stock Awards and Units These awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. During the vesting period, recipients of such awards receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or other limitations. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of Devons common stock on the grant date of the award or unit, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. The following table presents a summary of Devons unvested restricted stock awards and units.
Restricted StockAwards & Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (Inthousands) Unvested at December 31, 2010 5,311 $ 70.60 Granted 2,301 $ 65.40 Vested (2,188 ) $ 72.05 Forfeited (200 ) $ 71.18 Unvested at December 31, 2011 5,224 $ 67.85 The aggregate fair value of restricted stock awards and units that vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $145 million, $184 million and $165 million, respectively. As of December31, 2011, Devons unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock awards and units was $305 million. Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
62 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Performance Based Restricted Stock Awards In December 2011, certain members of Devons senior management were granted performance based share awards. Vesting of the awards is dependent on Devon meeting certain internal performance targets and the recipient meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. If Devon meets or exceeds the performance target, the awards vest after the recipient meets the related requisite service period. If the performance target and service period requirement are not met, the award does not vest. Once vested, recipients are entitled to dividends on the awards. Devon estimates the fair values of the awards as the closing price of Devons common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. The following table presents a summary of Devons performance based restricted stock awards.
Performance Restricted StockAwards Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (Inthousands) Unvested at December 31, 2010  $  Granted 184 $ 65.10 Unvested at December 31, 2011 184 $ 65.10 As of December31, 2011, Devons unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards was $4 million. Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.
Performance Share Units In December 2011, certain members of Devons senior management were granted performance share units. Each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of Devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on comparing Devons total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of fourteen peer companies over the specified two- or three-year performance period. The vesting of units may be between zero and 200 percent of the units granted depending on Devons TSR as compared to the peer group on the vesting date.
During the vesting period, recipients will receive dividend equivalents with respect to each outstanding performance share unit. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i)a risk-free interest rate; (ii)a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of Devon and the designated peer group; and (iii)an estimated ranking of Devon among the designated peer group. The fair value of the unit on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period.
The following table presents a summary of Devons performance share units.

63 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) As of December31, 2011, Devons unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested units was $8 million. Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

Restructuring Costs In the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon announced plans to divest its offshore assets. As of December31, 2011, Devon had divested all of its U.S. Offshore assets and substantially all of its International assets. Through the end of 2011, Devon had incurred $202 million of restructuring costs associated with these divestitures.
Employee Severance This amount was originally based on estimates of the number of employees that would ultimately be impacted by the offshore divestitures and included amounts related to cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of share-based grants. As the divestiture program progressed, Devon decreased its overall estimate of employee severance costs. More offshore employees than previously estimated received comparable positions with either the purchaser of the properties or in Devons U.S. Onshore operations.
Lease Obligations As a result of the divestitures, Devon ceased using certain office space that was subject to non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Consequently, in 2010 Devon recognized $70 million of restructuring costs that represented the present value of its future obligations under the leases, net of anticipated sublease income. Devons estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases. These estimates include the estimated sublease income that Devon may receive over the term of the leases, as well as the amount of variable operating costs that Devon will be required to pay under the leases. In addition, Devon recognized $11 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space that it ceased using.
Financial Statement Presentation The schedule below summarizes restructuring costs presented in the accompanying comprehensive statements of earnings. Restructuring costs relating to Devons discontinued operations totaled $(2) million, $(4) million, and $48 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These costs primarily relate to cash severance and share-based awards and are not included in the schedule below.

Income Taxes Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Devons income tax components are presented in the following table.

Accordingly, Devon recognized deferred income tax expense of $725 million, $144 million and $55 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively, related to assumed repatriations of earnings from its foreign subsidiaries.
66 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to Devons deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below: December31, 2011 2010 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 222 $ 159 Asset retirement obligations 447 494 Pension benefit obligations 130 133 Other 117 171 Total deferred tax assets 916 957 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment (4,475 ) (3,130 ) Fair value of financial instruments (218 ) (70 ) Long-term debt (185 ) (198 ) Taxes on unremitted foreign earnings (936 ) (211 ) Other (27 ) (20 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (5,841 ) (3,629 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (4,925 ) $ (2,672 ) Devon has recognized $222 million of deferred tax assets related to various carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The carryforwards consist of $829 million of Canadian net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between 2026 and 2031, and $206 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire primarily between 2012 and 2031. Devon expects the tax benefits from the Canadian net operating loss carryforwards to be utilized between 2013 and 2017. Also, Devon expects the tax benefits from the state net operating loss carryforwards to be utilized between 2012 and 2016. Such expectations are based upon current estimates of taxable income during these periods, considering limitations on the annual utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax regulations. Significant changes in such estimates caused by variables such as future oil, gas and NGL prices or capital expenditures could alter the timing of the eventual utilization of such carryforwards. There can be no assurance that Devon will generate any specific level of continuing taxable earnings. However, management believes that Devons future taxable income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize substantially all its tax carryforwards prior to their expiration.
As of December31, 2011, approximately $5.4 billion of Devons unremitted earnings from its foreign subsidiaries were deemed to be permanently reinvested. As a result, Devon has not recognized a deferred tax liability for U.S. income taxes associated with such earnings. If such earnings were to be remitted to the U.S., Devon may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. However, it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that may be payable due to the inter-relationship of the various factors involved in making such an estimate.

However, Devon is currently in various stages of the administrative review process for certain open tax years. In addition, Devon is currently subject to various income tax audits that have not reached the administrative review process. As a result, Devon cannot reasonably anticipate the extent that the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share The following table reconciles earnings from continuing operations and common shares outstanding used in the calculations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Because a net loss from continuing operations was incurred during 2009, the dilutive shares produce an antidilutive net loss per share result. As a result, the diluted loss per share from continuing operations is same as the basic loss per share amount.

In November 2009, Devon announced plans to divest its offshore assets. In 2011, Devon substantially completed its planned divestiture program. In aggregate, Devons U.S. and International sales generated total proceeds of $10 billion as presented in the following table. Assuming repatriation of a portion of the foreign proceeds under current U.S. tax law the after-tax proceeds from these transactions were approximately $8 billion.

The reduction resulted from a significant decrease in the full cost ceiling due to the effects of declining natural gas prices subsequent to December31, 2008.
Sinopec Transaction In January 2012, Devon announced a transaction with Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration& Production Corporation that Devon expects to close in the first quarter of 2012. Under the agreement, Sinopec will pay $2.5 billion, including $900 million at closing and $1.6 billion toward Devons share of future drilling costs, and will receive a 33.3% interest in five new venture exploration plays in the United States.

The maturity date for $2.19 billion of the Senior Credit Facility is April7, 2013. The maturity date for the remaining $0.46 billion is April7, 2012. All amounts outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April7 anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of U.S. $0.5 billion.
Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally less than the prime rate. However, Devon may elect to borrow at the prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides for an annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable quarterly in arrears. As of December31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.
The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devons ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 percent. The credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of December31, 2011, Devon was in compliance with this covenant. Devons debt-to-capitalization ratio at December31, 2011, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 22.8 percent.
Commercial Paper Devon has access to $5.0 billion of short-term credit under its commercial paper program. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is generally based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as found in the commercial paper market. As of December31, 2011, Devons weighted average borrowing rate on its commercial paper borrowings was 0.45 percent.
Other Debentures and Notes Following are descriptions of the various other debentures and notes outstanding at December31, 2011, as listed in the table presented at the beginning of this note.
5.625% Notes due January15, 2014 and 6.30% Notes due January15, 2019 In January 2009, Devon issued $1.2 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper as of December31, 2008. These notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon.
Non-Interest Bearing Promissory Note due June29, 2014 In June 2010, Devon issued a four-year $155 million Canadian dollar non-interest bearing promissory note in connection with the formation of the Pike oil sands joint venture. The present value of the note was $139 73 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) million on the issue date based upon an effective interest rate of 3.125%. At December31, 2011, the note had a carrying value of $85 million, which is presented as short-term debt in the accompanying balance sheet because it is expected to be repaid during 2012.
2.40% Notes due July15, 2016, 4.00% Notes due July15, 2021 and 5.60% Notes due July15, 2041 In July 2011, Devon issued $2.25 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper debt. These notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon.
Ocean Debt On April25, 2003, Devon merged with Ocean Energy, Inc. and assumed certain debt instruments. The table below summarizes the debt assumed that remains outstanding as of December31, 2011, including the fair value of the debt at April25, 2003, and the effective interest rate of the debt after determining the fair values using April25, 2003, market interest rates. The premiums resulting from fair values exceeding face values are being amortized using the effective interest method. Both notes are general unsecured obligations of Devon.

The increase was primarily due to an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates and a decrease in the discount rate used to present value the obligations.
During 2010, Devon reduced its asset retirement obligations by $269 million primarily for those obligations that were assumed by purchasers of Devons Gulf of Mexico oil and gas properties.
16.
Retirement Plans Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, including qualified plans and nonqualified plans. The qualified plans provide retirement benefits for certain U.S. and Canadian employees meeting certain age and service requirements. Benefits for the qualified plans are based on the employees years of service and compensation and are funded from assets held in the plans trusts.
The nonqualified plans provide retirement benefits for certain employees whose benefits under the qualified plans are limited by income tax regulations. The nonqualified plans benefits are based on the employees years of service and compensation. For certain nonqualified plans, Devon has established trusts to fund these plans benefit obligations. The total value of these trusts was $32 million and $36 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheets. For the remaining nonqualified plans for which trusts have not been established, benefits are funded from Devons available cash and cash equivalents.
Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans that provide benefits for substantially all U.S. employees. The plans provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and are, depending on the type of plan, either contributory or non-contributory. Benefit obligations for such plans are estimated based on Devons future cost-sharing intentions. Devons funding policy for the plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with available cash and cash equivalents.
75 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Benefit Obligations and Funded Status The following table presents the funded status of Devons qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligation for pension plans represents the projected benefit obligation, while the benefit obligation for the postretirement benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation for pension plans at December31, 2011 and 2010 was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Devons benefit obligations and plan assets are measured each year as of December31. Devons 2011 pension plan contributions of $454 million presented in the table were primarily discretionary. After these contributions, the projected benefit obligation for Devons qualified plans was fully funded as of December31, 2011.

Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Assumptions to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 4.65 % 5.50 % 6.00 % 4.25 % 4.90 % 5.70 % Rate of compensation increase 4.97 % 6.94 % 6.95 % N/A N/A N/A Assumptions to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 5.50 % 6.00 % 6.00 % 4.90 % 5.70 % 6.00 % Expected return on plan assets 6.48 % 6.94 % 7.18 % N/A N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 6.94 % 6.95 % 6.95 % N/A N/A N/A Discount rate Future pension and postretirement obligations are discounted at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled, considering the timing of estimated future cash flows related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk.
Rate of compensation increase For measurement of the 2011 benefit obligation for the pension plans, a 4.97% compensation increase was assumed.
Expected return on plan assets The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by evaluating input from external consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Devon expects the long-term asset allocation to approximate the targeted allocation. Therefore, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the target allocation of investment types. See the pension plan assets section below for more information on Devons target allocations.
Other assumptions For measurement of the 2011 benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans, an 8.2% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2012. The rate was assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of 5% in the year 2029 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost-trend rates affect the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have changed the postretirement benefits obligation as of December31, 2011, by $2 million and would change the 2012 service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by less than $1 million.
Pension Plan Assets Devons overall investment objective for its pension plans assets is to achieve stability of the plans funded status while providing long-term growth of invested capital and income to ensure benefit payments can be funded when required. To assist in achieving this objective, Devon has established certain investment strategies, including target allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments, designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. Derivatives or other speculative investments considered high risk are generally prohibited. The following table presents Devons target allocation for its pension plan assets. Devon made significant contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2011. As a result, Devon revised its target allocations in 2011.

Fixed-income securities Devons fixed-income securities consist of U.S. Treasury obligations, bonds issued by investment-grade companies from diverse industries, and asset-backed securities. These fixed-income securities are actively traded securities that can be redeemed upon demand. The fair values of these Level 1 securities are based upon quoted market prices.
Devons fixed income securities also include commingled funds that primarily invest in long-term bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. These fixed income securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are based upon the net asset values provided by the investment managers.
Equity securities Devons equity securities include a commingled global equity fund that invests in large, mid and small capitalization stocks across the worlds developed and emerging markets. These equity securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are based upon the net asset values provided by the investment managers.
At December31, 2010, Devons equity securities consisted of investments in U.S. large and small capitalization companies and international large capitalization companies. These equity securities were actively traded securities that could be redeemed upon demand. The fair values of these Level 1 securities are based upon quoted market prices.
At December31, 2010, Devons equity securities also included a commingled fund that invested in large capitalization companies.

Other securities Devons other securities include commingled, short-term investment funds. These securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are based upon the net asset values provided by investment managers.
Devons hedge fund and alternative investments include an investment in an actively traded global mutual fund that focuses on alternative investment strategies and a hedge fund of funds that invests both long and short using a variety of investment strategies. Devons hedge fund of funds is not actively traded and Devon is subject to redemption restrictions with regards to this investment. The fair value of this Level 3 investment represents the fair value as determined by the hedge fund manager.

Stockholders Equity The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of 1 billion shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and 4.5million shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, and the terms and rights of such stock will be determined by the Board of Directors.
Devons Board of Directors has designated 2.9million shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the Series A Junior Preferred Stock). At December31, 2011, there were no shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per share equal to the greater of $1.00 or 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends) declared on common stock since the immediately 81 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) preceding quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock are entitled to 100 votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Devon, at its option, may redeem shares of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in whole at any time and in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 times the current per share market price of Devons common stock on the date of the mailing of the notice of redemption. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but junior to all other classes of Preferred Stock.
Stock Repurchases During 2010, Devons Board of Directors announced a share repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to $3.5 billion of its common shares. Devon completed the repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2011. In total, Devon repurchased 49.2million shares for $3.5 billion, or $71.18 per share. The following table summarizes Devons repurchases under the 2010 program by year (amounts and shares in millions).

Commitments and Contingencies Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, Devons estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Devons financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ materially from managements estimate.
Royalty Matters Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with respect to such royalty matters.
Environmental Matters Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss accruals primarily consist of estimated uninsured costs associated with remediation. Devons monetary exposure for environmental matters is not expected to be material.
82 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Chief Redemption Matters In 2006, Devon acquired Chief Holdings LLC (Chief) from the owners of Chief, including Trevor Rees-Jones, the majority owner of Chief. In 2008, a former owner of Chief filed a petition against Rees-Jones, as the former majority owner of Chief, and Devon, as Chiefs successor pursuant to the 2006 acquisition. The petition claimed, among other things, violations of the Texas Securities Act, fraud and breaches of Rees-Jones fiduciary responsibility to the former owner in connection with Chiefs 2004 redemption of the owners minority ownership stake in Chief.
On June20, 2011, a court issued a judgment against Rees-Jones for $196 million, of which $133 million of the judgment was also issued against Devon. Both Rees-Jones and Devon are appealing the judgment. However, if the appeal is unsuccessful, Devon can and will seek full payment of the judgment and any related interest, costs and expenses from Rees-Jones pursuant to an existing indemnification agreement between Rees-Jones, certain other parties and Devon. Devon does not expect to have any net exposure as a result of the judgment. However, because Devon does not have a legal right of set off with respect to the judgment, Devon has recorded in its December31, 2011, balance sheet both a $133 million liability relating to the judgment with an offsetting $133 million receivable relating to its right to be indemnified by Rees-Jones and certain other parties pursuant to the indemnification agreement.
Other Matters Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devons knowledge, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.
Commitments The following is a schedule by year of Devons commitments that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2011.

Devon entered into these agreements because the condensate is an integral part of the heavy oil production process and any disruption in Devons ability to obtain condensate could negatively affect its ability to produce and transport heavy oil at these locations. Devons total obligation related to condensate purchases expires in 2021. The value of these purchase obligations presented in the table above is based on the contractual volumes and Devons internal estimate of future condensate market prices.
83 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under contractual agreements with third-party service providers to procure drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities construction.
Devon has certain operational agreements whereby Devon has committed to transport or process certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to aid the movement of its production to market.
Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and administrative expenses under operating leases, net of sub-lease income, was $42 million, $57 million and $56 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements The following tables provide carrying value and fair value measurement information for Devons financial assets and liabilities. The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, other current receivables, accounts payable, other payables and accrued expenses included in the accompanying balance sheets approximated fair value at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010. These assets and liabilities are not presented in the following table. Additionally, information regarding the fair values of Devons pension plan assets is provided in Note 16.

Level 1 Fair Value Measurements Cash equivalents and short-term investments Amounts consist primarily of U.S. and Canadian Treasury bills and money market investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.
84 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Level 2 Fair Value Measurements Cash equivalents and short-term investments Amounts consist primarily of commercial paper investments. The fair value is based upon quotes from brokers, which generally approximate the carrying value.
Commodity and interest rate derivatives The fair values of commodity and interest rate derivatives are estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and quotes obtained from brokers for contracts with similar terms or quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements.
Debt Devons debt instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The fair values of its fixed-rate debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity. The fair value of Devons variable-rate commercial paper borrowings is the carrying value.
Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Debt Devons Level 3 debt consisted of a non-interest bearing promissory note. Due to the lack of an active market, quoted marked prices for this note were not available. Therefore, Devon used valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of its promissory note. The fair value of this debt is estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon estimated future payment schedules and a 3.125% interest rate. As a result of using these inputs, Devon concluded the estimated fair value of its non-interest bearing promissory note approximated the carrying value as of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010.
Long-term investments Devons long-term investments presented in the tables above consisted entirely of auction rate securities. Due to auction failures and the lack of an active market for Devons auction rate securities, quoted market prices for these securities were not available. Therefore, Devon used valuation techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair values of its long-term auction rate securities. These inputs were based on the AAA credit rating of the securities, the probability of full repayment of the securities considering the U.S. government guarantees substantially all of the underlying student loans, the collection of all accrued interest to date and continued receipts of principal at par. As a result of using these inputs, Devon concluded the estimated fair values of its long-term auction rate securities approximated the par values as of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010.

Discontinued Operations For the three-year period ended December31, 2011, Devons discontinued operations included amounts related to its assets in Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Angola and other minor International properties. By the end of 2011, Devon had sold all these assets except for its assets in Angola. Devon has entered into an agreement to sell its Angolan assets. Upon closing, Devon will receive $70 million and the right to future contingent consideration based on achievement of certain objectives.
Revenues related to Devons discontinued operations totaled $43 million, $693 million and $945 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes totaled $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $322 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Earnings before income taxes in 2011 and 2010 were largely impacted by gains on divestiture transactions. The following table presents the gains on the divestitures by year.

This reduction resulted largely from an exploratory well drilled at the BM-BAR-3 block in the offshore Barreirinhas Basin that did not have adequate reserves for commercial viability.

Segment Information Devon manages its operations through distinct operating segments, or divisions, which are defined primarily by geographic areas. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. divisions into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of the businesses. However, Devons Canadian division is reported as a separate reporting segment primarily due to the significant differences in the regulatory environment. Devons segments are all primarily engaged in oil and gas producing activities, and certain information regarding such activities for each segment is included in Note 22. Following is certain financial information regarding Devons segments. Revenues are all from external customers.

This rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids reserves are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.
94 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Proved Undeveloped Reserves The following table presents the changes in our total proved undeveloped reserves during 2011 (in MMBoe).
U.S.Onshore Canada NorthAmerica Proved undeveloped reserves as of December31, 2010 411 420 831 Extensions and discoveries 118 30 148 Revisions due to prices (2 ) (14 ) (16 ) Revisions other than price (56 ) 5 (51 ) Conversion to proved developed reserves (68 ) (62 ) (130 ) Proved undeveloped reserves as of December31, 2011 403 379 782 At December31, 2011, Devon had 782 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves. This represents a 6% decrease as compared to 2010 and represents 26% of its total proved reserves. Drilling activities increased Devons proved undeveloped reserves 148 MMBoe and resulted in the conversion of 130 MMBoe, or 16%, of the 2010 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Additionally, revisions other than price decreased Devons proved undeveloped reserves 51 MMBoe primarily due to its evaluation of certain U.S. onshore dry-gas areas, which it does not expect to develop in the next five years. The largest revisions relate to the dry-gas areas at Carthage in east Texas and the Barnett Shale in north Texas.
A significant amount of Devons proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2011 largely related to its Jackfish operations. At December31, 2011 and 2010, Devons Jackfish proved undeveloped reserves were 367 MMBoe and 396 MMBoe, respectively. Development schedules for the Jackfish reserves are primarily controlled by the need to keep the processing plants at their 35,000 barrel daily facility capacity. Processing plant capacity is controlled by factors such as total steam processing capacity, steam-oil ratios and air quality discharge permits. As a result, these reserves are classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years. Currently, the development schedule for these reserves extends though the year 2025.
Price Revisions 2011 Reserves decreased 21 MMBoe due to lower gas prices and higher oil prices. The higher oil prices increased Devons Canadian royalty burden, which reduced Devons oil reserves.
2010 Reserves increased 72 MMBoe due to higher gas prices, partially offset by the effect of higher oil prices. The higher oil prices increased Devons Canadian royalty burden, which reduced Devons oil reserves. Of the 72 MMBoe price revisions, 43 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale and 22 MMBoe related to the Rocky Mountain area.
2009 Reserves increased 177 MMBoe due to higher oil prices, partially offset by lower gas prices. The increase in oil reserves primarily related to Devons Jackfish thermal heavy oil reserves in Canada. At the end of 2008, 331 MMBoe of reserves related to Jackfish were not considered proved. However, due to higher prices, these reserves were considered proved as of December31, 2009. Significantly lower gas prices caused Devons reserves to decrease 116 MMBoe, which primarily related to its U.S. reserves.
Revisions Other Than Price Total revisions other than price for 2011 primarily related to Devons evaluation of certain dry gas regions noted in the proved undeveloped reserves discussion above. Total revisions other than price for 2010 and 2009 primarily related to Devons drilling and development in the Barnett Shale.
95 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Extensions and Discoveries 2011 Of the 421 MMBoe of 2011 extensions and discoveries, 162 MMBoe related to the Cana-Woodford Shale in western Oklahoma, 115 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale, 39 MMBoe related to the Permian Basin, 30 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 19 MMBoe related to the Rocky Mountain area and 17 MMBoe related to the Granite Wash area in the Texas panhandle and western Oklahoma.
The 2011 extensions and discoveries included 168 MMBoe related to additions from Devons infill drilling activities, including 80 MMBoe at the Cana-Woodford Shale and 77 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale.
2010 Of the 354 MMBoe of 2010 extensions and discoveries, 101 MMBoe related to the Cana-Woodford Shale, 87 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale, 55 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 19 MMBoe related to the Permian Basin, 15 MMBoe related to the Rocky Mountain area and 14 MMBoe related to the Carthage area.
The 2010 extensions and discoveries included 107 MMBoe related to additions from Devons infill drilling activities, including 43 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale and 47 MMBoe at the Cana-Woodford Shale.
2009 Of the 458 MMBoe of 2009 extensions and discoveries, 204 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale, 118 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 49 MMBoe related to the Cana-Woodford Shale, 14 MMBoe related to the Rocky Mountain area, 11 MMBoe related to Deepwater Production in the Gulf, 8 MMBoe related to the Carthage area and 7 MMBoe related to the Haynesville Shale area in east Texas.
The 2009 extensions and discoveries included 371 MMBoe related to additions from Devons infill drilling activities, including 203 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale, 118 MMBoe at Jackfish and 24 MMBoe at the Cana-Woodford Shale.
Sale of Reserves The 2010 total primarily relates to the divestiture of Devons Gulf of Mexico properties.
SECs Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting At the end of 2009, Devon adopted the SECs Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting , as well as the conforming rule changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Upon adoption, the two primary rule changes that impacted Devons year-end reserves estimates were those related to assumptions for pricing and reasonable certainty.
The SECs prior rules required proved reserve estimates to be calculated using prices as of the end of the period and held constant over the life of the reserves. The revised rules require reserves estimates to be calculated using an average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding 12-month period.
The revised rules amend the definition of proved reserves to permit the use of reliable technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves. This revision includes provisions for establishing levels of lowest known hydrocarbons and highest known oil through reliable technology other than well penetrations. This revision also allows proved reserves to be claimed beyond development spacing areas that are immediately adjacent to developed spacing areas if economic producibility can be established with reasonable certainty based on reliable technologies. As a result of adopting these provisions of the new rules, Devons 2009 reserves increased approximately 65 MMBoe, or 2%. This increase is included in the 2009 extensions and discoveries total.
96 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Standardized Measure The tables below reflect Devons standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves.

For 2011, the prices averaged $67.31 per barrel of oil, $3.51 per Mcf of gas and $39.28 per barrel of natural gas liquids. Of the $11.5 billion of future development costs as of the end of 2011, $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion are estimated to be spent in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
97 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) Future development costs include not only development costs, but also future asset retirement costs. Included as part of the $11.5 billion of future development costs are $2.2 billion of future asset retirement costs. Future production costs include general and administrative expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect to permanent differences and tax credits but do not reflect the impact of future operations.
The principal changes in Devons standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are as follows: Year Ended December31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 16,352 $ 11,403 $ 9,393 Oil, gas and NGL sales, net of production costs (5,794 ) (4,982 ) (3,915 ) Net changes in prices and production costs 1,875 7,423 (1,672 ) Extensions and discoveries, net of future development costs 3,714 3,048 2,378 Purchase of reserves, net of future development costs 57 23 6 Development costs incurred that reduced future development costs 1,302 1,559 1,012 Revisions of quantity estimates (668 ) 287 4,051 Sales of reserves in place (2 ) (815 ) (37 ) Accretion of discount 2,248 1,487 1,281 Net change in income taxes (929 ) (2,663 ) (51 ) Other, primarily changes in timing and foreign exchange rates (311 ) (418 ) (1,043 ) Ending balance $ 17,844 $ 16,352 $ 11,403 The following table presents Devons estimated pretax cash flow information related to its proved reserves.
Year Ended December31, 2011 U.S.
Canada NorthAmerica (In millions) Pre-Tax Future Net Revenue(1) Proved Developed Reserves $ 30,473 $ 7,757 $ 38,230 Proved Undeveloped Reserves 5,798 9,288 15,086 Total Proved Reserves $ 36,271 $ 17,045 $ 53,316 Pre-Tax 10% Present Value(1) Proved Developed Reserves $ 15,165 $ 5,830 $ 20,995 Proved Undeveloped Reserves 1,404 2,508 3,912 Total Proved Reserves $ 16,569 $ 8,338 $ 24,907 (1) Estimated pre-tax future net revenue represents estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and development costs and site restoration and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not give effect to depreciation, depletion and amortization, or to non-property related expenses such as debt service and income tax expense.
The present value of after-tax future net revenues discounted at 10%per annum (standardized measure) was $17.8 billion at the end of 2011. Included as part of standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of $7.1 billion. Excluding these taxes, the present value of our pre-tax future net revenue 98 Table of Contents DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued) (pre-tax 10% present value) was $24.9 billion. Devon believes the pre-tax 10% present value is a useful measure in addition to the after-tax standardized measure. The pre-tax 10% present value assists in both the determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among peer companies. The after-tax standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company, while the pre-tax 10% present value is based on prices and discount factors, which are more consistent from company to company.
