BUSINESS (Continued) Status of New Products The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.The acquisition of Wild Flavors expands the Company's ability to serve the customers' evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products.  The Company does not expect any of its new products to have a significant impact on the Companys revenues in 2015.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials Substantially all of the Companys raw materials are agricultural commodities.In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.The Companys raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses The Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses, including approximately $240 million of trademarks from the Wild Flavors acquisition in 2014 (see Note 2 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Item 8)), but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses.
Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Companys principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa beans, sugarcane, and other grains.
The price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affects the Companys working capital requirements.Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.No material part of the Companys business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.
Competition The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, quality, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Companys asset portfolio.
Research and Development Expenditures The Companys research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers product development or formulation needs, improving processing efficiency, and developing food, feed, fuel, and industrial products from renewable agricultural crops.Research and development expense during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012, net of reimbursements of government grants, was approximately $79 million , $59 million , $28 million , $29 million , and $56 million , respectively.The increase in 2014 is due principally to research and development activities of the recently acquired Wild Flavors.
8 Item 1.
BUSINESS (Continued) The Company is working with the U.S. Department of Energys National Energy Technology Laboratory and other key academic and corporate partners on projects to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration as a viable option for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations.The first project, Illinois Basin Decatur Project led by Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium started operations in the first quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and successfully completed injecting 1 million tons of CO 2 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.The second project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture & Sequestration commenced construction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. This facility obtained the underground injection control permit in November 2014 and is expected to be operational in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015.
The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of industrial chemicals with an objective to produce key chemical building blocks that serve as a platform for producing a variety of commodity chemicals.The key chemical building blocks are derived from the Companys starch and oilseed-based feedstocks.Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis.The chemicals pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently produced from petrochemical resources as well as new-to-the-market bio-based products. The Companys current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. In an effort to further advance the development of bio-based chemical technologies, the Company has partnered with the Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis and has added research capabilities at the University of Kansas.
Environmental Compliance During the year ended December31, 2014 , $50 million was spent specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.
There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with federal, state, and local laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.
The Companys business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted regulations requiring the owners and operators of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. EPA has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary and mobile sources under the Clean Air Act.For example, the U.S. EPA has proposed rules regarding the construction and operation of boilers, which could indirectly affect the Company by limiting the construction of new coal-fired boilers and significantly increasing the complexity and cost of modifying any existing coal-fired boilers.  California is also moving forward with various programs to reduce greenhouse gases.Globally, a number of countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol have instituted or are considering climate change legislation and regulations. Most notable is the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System. The Company has several facilities in Europe that participate in this system. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.
Number of Employees The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 33,900 at December31, 2014 and 31,100 at December31, 2013 .The net increase in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to acquisitions.
Financial Information About Foreign and U.S. Operations Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 2, Properties, includes information relating to the Companys foreign and U.S. operations.Geographic financial information is set forth in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, and various other factors beyond the Companys control and could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.Additionally, the Company depends globally on farmers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the Company in its operations is maintained.  These factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and, consequently, in the Companys operating results and working capital requirements.Reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons could adversely affect the Companys profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Companys ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.For example, a drought in North America in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased.High and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the Companys ability to meet its liquidity needs.
10 Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.
The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors.The company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, workforce, and other materials and supplies.Additionally, competitors offer similar products and services, as well as alternative products and services, to the Companys customers.The Company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits, and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating, working capital, dividend, or capital expenditure needs.Competition impacts the Companys ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors.Pricing of the Companys products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring on-line idled capacity or to build new production capacity.Many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities.The markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution.In addition, continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the Company.  To compete effectively, the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market share, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions.Competition could increase the Companys costs to purchase raw materials, lower selling prices of its products, or reduce the Companys market share, which may result in lower and more inefficient operating rates and reduced gross profit.
Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Companys operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.The Companys processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.The Companys transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.Significant increases in the cost of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Companys production costs and operating results.
The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products.Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline and diesel fuel.A significant decrease in the price of gasoline or diesel fuel could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Companys ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.
The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While 54 percent of the Companys processing plants and 65 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the United States, the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe, Canada, Brazil) and emerging market areas (such as Eastern Europe, Asia, portions of South and Central America, the Middle East, and Africa).  One of the Company's strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Companys products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Companys suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows, local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability.Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Companys operating results and ability to execute its business strategies.
11 Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS (Continued) Government policies, mandates, and regulations, in general; government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; and political instability and other risks of doing business globally could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, the viability and volume of production of certain of the Companys products, and industry profitability.For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel, including but not limited to changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, can have a significant impact on the Companys operating results.International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.  Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, Consumer Protection Act, and European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company's agricultural commodity risk management practices as well as the Company's futures commission merchant business.  Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Companys products; restrict the Companys ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.
The Companys operating results could be affected by changes in other governmental policies, mandates, and regulations including monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, regulations, acquisition approvals, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations.These risks include but are not limited to changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Companys ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.
The Company's strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  Government policies, including anti-trust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, and other government regulations and mandates, can impact the Company's ability to execute this strategy successfully.
The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable farming practices; environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.In addition, negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage the Companys reputation.The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.
Certain of the Companys merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.The Company is subject to risks associated with economic or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry.An outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for the Companys products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.A decrease in demand for ingredients in livestock and poultry feed could adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.
12 Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Companys operating results and forward strategy.
The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in 147 countries.The Company is required to comply with the numerous and broad-reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state and local, and foreign governmental authorities.The Company must comply with other general business regulations such as accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, environmental, and handling and production of regulated substances.The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.As examples, the Company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company covering various prior periods.Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies including fines, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation.
The production of the Companys products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including greenhouse gas emissions.Although the Company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to guard against non-compliance, failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties as well as a negative impact on the Companys reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations.
In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations, for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws, may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.
The Company is exposed to potential business disruption, including but not limited to disruption of transportation services, supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and accidents which could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Companys operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services.A disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Companys facilities and impair the Companys ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively.If access to these navigable waters is interrupted, the Companys operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Companys processing operations, are not available, the Companys business could be disrupted.Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company's processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Companys control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.
The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism, for example, economic adulteration of the Company's products, or war, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and fires. The potential effects of these conditions could adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results.
13 Item 1A.
RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Companys business is capital-intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs. Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company requires significant capital, including access to credit markets from time to time, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy. The Companys working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations and changing safety standards in the industry. Moreover, the expansion of the Companys business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.Access to credit markets and pricing of the Companys capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access tier one commercial paper markets.  If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected.If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Companys current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Companys risk management strategies may not be effective.
The Companys business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company has processes in place to monitor exposures to these risks and engages in strategies to manage these risks.The Companys monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Companys exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Companys operating results.
The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures.
The Company has $3.9 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to the governance and management activities of these investments.Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December31, 2014 was $5.8 billion .The Company faces certain risks, including risks related to the financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investments activities; and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the investment partner.The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues or financial results related to these investments that may impact the Companys revenues and operating results.
The Companys information technology (IT) systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches, or failures which may affect the Companys ability to conduct its business.
The Companys operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users.These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, risk management activities, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business.Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company's IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company's data.  The Company has put in place security measures to protect itself against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.However, if the Companys IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Companys disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Companys revenues, operating results, and financial condition.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, including with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations relating to the environment and, at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.
On April 22, 2011, certain manufacturers and distributors of sugar cane and beet sugar products filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against the Company, other manufacturers and marketers of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and the Corn Refiners Association, alleging that the defendants falsely claimed that HFCS is "natural" and nutritionally equivalent to sugar.  The defendants have filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs.  The parties are currently engaged in pretrial proceedings.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Company Overview This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in 147 countries.The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, wheat and cocoa into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.
The Companys operations are organized, managed and classified into three reportable business segments: Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services.Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.The Companys remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Flavors and SCI for a total consideration of $2.9 billion, making the Company one of the worlds leading flavors and specialty ingredients companies.  Effective January 1, 2015, the Company has formed a fourth reportable business segment, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Results of Wild Flavors and SCI were reported in Other as the 2014 results were not material to the Company.
The Oilseeds Processing segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and industrial products industries.Crude vegetable oils produced by the segments crushing activities are sold as is or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.Salad oils are sold as is or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.In Europe and South America, the Oilseeds Processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.These activities include a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport grains and oilseeds.The Oilseeds Processing segment produces natural health and nutrition products and other specialty food and feed ingredients.The Oilseeds Processing segment is a major supplier of peanuts and peanut-derived ingredients to both the U.S. and export markets.In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also includes activities related to the procurement, transportation and processing of cocoa beans into cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa powder, chocolate, and various compounds in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa for the food processing industry.The Oilseeds Processing segment also includes the Companys share of the results of its equity investment in Wilmar and its share of results for its Stratas Foods LLC and Edible Oils Limited joint ventures.  Prior to December 2014, the Oilseeds Processing segment operated fertilizer blending facilities in South America.  In December 2014, the Company completed the sale of its fertilizer blending business.
27 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Companys Corn Processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities, with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the United States.The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches, and bioproducts.Its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.Dextrose and starch are used by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.By fermentation of dextrose, the Corn Processing segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other specialty food and animal feed ingredients.Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.Ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.Bioproducts also include amino acids such as lysine and threonine that are vital compounds used in swine feeds to produce leaner animals and in poultry feeds to enhance the speed and efficiency of poultry production.Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.Other Corn Processing products include citric and lactic acids, lactates, sorbitol, xanthan gum, and glycols which are used in various food and industrial products.The Corn Processing segment includes the activities of a propylene and ethylene glycol facility and the Companys Brazilian sugarcane ethanol plant and related operations.This segment also includes the Companys share of the results of its equity investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., Eaststarch C.V., and Red Star Yeast Company LLC.
The Agricultural Services segment utilizes its extensive U.S. grain elevator, global transportation network, and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.The Agricultural Services grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the Companys customers and agricultural processing operations. Agricultural Services transportation network capabilities include barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, and rail freight services.Agricultural Services segment also includes the activities related to the processing of wheat into wheat flour, the processing and distribution of formula feeds, animal health and nutrition products, and the procurement, processing, and distribution of edible beans.The Agricultural Services segment includes the activities of Toepfer, a global merchant of agricultural commodities and processed products.On June 6, 2014, the Company announced that it has completed its acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in Toepfer.  The Agricultural Services segment also includes the Companys 32.2% share of the results of its Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company LLC) joint venture and returns associated with the Company's 19.8% investment in GrainCorp.  Prior to December 2012, the Company had a 23.2% interest in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. (Gruma), the worlds largest producer and marketer of corn flour and tortillas.Additionally, the Company had joint ventures in corn flour and wheat flour mills with and through Gruma.In December 2012, the Company sold its 23.2% interest in Gruma and the Gruma-related joint ventures.
Other includes the activities of Wild Flavors, SCI, and the Companys remaining operations, primarily its financial business units, related principally to futures commission merchant and insurance activities.
Corporate results principally include the impact of LIFO-related inventory adjustments, unallocated corporate expenses, interest cost net of investment income, and the Companys share of the results of an equity investment.  Corporate results also include the after-tax elimination of income attributable to the minority shareholder of Toepfer except during the calendar year 2012 when the put options related to these interests expired and the results were included in noncontrolling interest.  The Company acquired the remaining 20% interest in Toepfer during the second quarter of 2014, thus no longer requiring the elimination of income attributable to the minority shareholder as of June 30, 2014.
Significant Ongoing Portfolio Management Actions The Company's recently announced additional significant actions in its portfolio management include:  completing the sale of its fertilizer blending business in Brazil and Paraguay on December 17, 2014 following the announcement of a signed agreement with The Mosaic Company to sell the business on April 15, 2014;  announcing the sale of its global chocolate business to Cargill, Inc. for $440 million on September 2, 2014;  announcing the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam International Limited for $1.3 billion on December 15, 2014; and  signing an agreement with Glencore plc to sell a 50 percent stake in its export terminal in Barcarena, in the northern Brazilian state of Par on February 3, 2015.
28 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The chocolate, cocoa, and export terminal transactions are expected to close in 2015, subject to completion of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, which are in process.  The chocolate and cocoa businesses are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014.
Operating Performance Indicators The Companys oilseeds processing and agricultural services operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.
The Companys corn processing operations and certain other food and animal feed processing operations also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.
The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in 79 countries.For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.For the majority of the Companys business activities in Brazil, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency.Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar can result in corresponding fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of revenues and expenses reported by the Company.
The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, and cost per metric ton.The Companys operating results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings,government programs and policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Year Ended December31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2013 As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results.  Demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong and steady.  Demand for export of North American corn and soybeans was strong, but logistical challenges during the winter months, including rail delays and river freezes, caused higher costs making U.S. exports less competitive.  Despite a large harvest in South America, U.S. grain exports continued for longer than normal in 2014 due to slow South American farmer selling.  U.S. corn and wheat storage and merchandising opportunities were limited for much of the year until the 2014 record fall harvest.  Corn sweetener demand was steady.  Strong U.S. ethanol demand from both domestic and export markets, combined with industry logistical and production challenges in the winter months, led to volatile but strong overall 2014 ethanol margins. South American grain and oilseed origination volumes and margins were challenged by the slow farmer selling.  Cocoa press margins have continued to improve from last year when margins were negatively impacted by excess capacity.
29 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.9 billion to $2.2 billion.   Segment operating profit was $3.9 billion , up 45%, due primarily to improved corn processing and grain merchandising and handling results.  Included in this year's segment operating profit was a gain of approximately $156 million upon the Company's effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, long-lived asset impairment charges of $35 million, and Wild Flavors restructuring charges and acquisition costs of $33 million.  In 2013, segment operating profit included a $155 million write-down related to the Company's GrainCorp investment, a $51 million impairment of certain long-lived assets at its Brazilian sugar mill, and approximately $27 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges principally in the Corn Processing segment.  Excluding these unique items, segment operating profit improved approximately 26% in 2014.  Corporate costs of $785 million in 2014 were higher by $101 million .  Included in 2014 costs were losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated Wild Flavors acquisition and $98 million of non-cash pension settlement charges.  The prior year period included $54 million of charges related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp acquisition, $21 million costs related to strategic projects, and costs of $32 million primarily related to asset write-downs and allocations of costs between corporate and the operating segments.  In 2014, LIFO inventory reserves declined resulting in pretax LIFO credits to earnings of $245 million compared to LIFO credits of $225 million in 2013.  Excluding  LIFO and these other items, corporate costs increased $68 million, which is primarily due to higher enterprise resource planning project, I.T., and other project-related costs.  Partially offsetting the increase was lower interest expense due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.
The Company's effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.0% compared to 33.1% for 2013.  The 2014 rate was positively impacted by $47 million of positive discrete tax adjustments and a slight favorable shift in the geographic mix of earnings.  The 2013 rate was negatively impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, partially offset by favorable discrete income tax benefits related to amounts received from the U.S. government in the form of biodiesel credits.  Excluding these factors, the effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 30%.
Analysis of Statements of Earnings Processed volumes by product for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in metric tons): (In thousands) 2014 2013 Change Oilseeds 32,208 31,768 440 Corn 23,668 23,688 (20 ) Milling and cocoa 7,318 7,226 92 Total 63,194 62,682 512 The Company continued to operate its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Revenues by segment for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: (In millions) 2014 2013 Change Oilseeds Processing Crushing and Origination $ 18,542 $ 20,522 $ (1,980 ) Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other 9,111 10,375 (1,264 ) Cocoa and Other 3,439 3,281 158 Asia 454 705 (251 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 31,546 34,883 (3,337 ) Corn Processing Sweeteners and Starches 3,749 4,717 (968 ) Bioproducts 7,937 8,422 (485 ) Total Corn Processing 11,686 13,139 (1,453 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising and Handling 33,061 36,968 (3,907 ) Milling and Other 4,001 4,284 (283 ) Transportation 265 228 37 Total Agricultural Services 37,327 41,480 (4,153 ) Other Processing 312  312 Financial 330 302 28 Total Other 642 302 340 Total $ 81,201 $ 89,804 $ (8,603 ) Revenues in 2014 decreased 10% to $81.2 billion due principally to lower average sales prices ($8.0 billion) related to a decrease in underlying commodity prices, lower overall sales volumes ($0.7 billion), and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.2 billion partially offset by higher revenues in Other ($0.3 billion) due to recent acquisitions.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on cost of products sold.  Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased 10% to $31.5 billion due principally to lower sales volumes for soybeans and soybean meal ($1.9 billion) and lower average sales prices ($1.4 billion).  Corn Processing revenues decreased 11% to $11.7 billion due principally to lower average sales prices ($1.6 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.1 billion).  Agricultural Services revenues decreased 10% to $37.3 billion due principally to lower average sales prices ($5.2 billion) and partially offset by higher sales volumes ($1.1 billion).
Cost of products sold decreased 11% to $76.4 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.   Included in 2014 cost of products sold is a credit of $245 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $225 million in 2013.  Manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion mostly due to higher energy costs and higher maintenance costs.  Higher energy costs were driven by unusually high volatility of natural gas prices during the winter months early in the year due primarily to supply interruptions impacted by the severe winter weather conditions.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $148 million to $1.9 billion due principally to a $98 million non-cash pretax pension settlement charge related to settling certain U.S. retiree liabilities with lump sum payments and incremental SG&A expenses of $73 million related to the acquired Wild Flavors and SCI businesses, partially offset by the absence of the prior year charge of $54 million related to an anti-corruption settlement.  In addition, salaries and benefits and enterprise resource planning project, information technology, and other project-related costs were higher year over year.
31 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs of $105 million include $16 million of costs associated with the relocation of  the Companys global headquarters to Chicago, Illinois, $48 million of restructuring charges related primarily to the Wild Flavors acquisition and Toepfer integration following the acquisition of the minority interest, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and property, plant, and equipment asset impairments of $35 million.  The 2013 charges of $259 million were comprised of other-than-temporary impairment charges of $155 million on the Company's GrainCorp investment, asset impairment charges of $51 million related to the Company's Brazilian sugar milling business, and other impairment charges principally for certain property, plant, and equipment assets totaling $53 million.
Interest expense decreased $76 million to $337 million primarily due to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.  During February 2014, the Company repaid $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes with available funds.
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $39 million to $372 million primarily due to lower earnings from the Companys investments in CIP and Wilmar.
Other income increased $194 million to $247 million due principally to a gain of $156 million upon the Company's effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the South American fertilizer business, and the absence of prior year losses of $40 million on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp acquisition, partially offset by current period losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the Wild Flavors acquisition.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $132 million to $1.6 billion .  Included in the current year operating profit is a charge of approximately $17 million for cocoa hedge timing effects compared to a charge of approximately $13 million in the prior year.  Crushing and Origination operating profit increased $33 million to $868 million .  Included in the current year results is a gain on sale of the fertilizer business of $126 million.  Excluding this gain the Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased by $93 million primarily due to lower South American grain origination results caused by year-over-year slower farmer-selling, reduced crush margins and lower fertilizer results partially offset by strong soybean and softseed volumes and margins in North America and Europe.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results improved $24 million to $478 million on good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and  improved European biodiesel results.  Cocoa and Other results, including the mark-to-market timing effects discussed above, improved $125 million to $92 million as cocoa press margins significantly increased.  Asia results declined $50 million to $167 million , principally reflecting a decrease from the Companys share of its results from its equity investee, Wilmar.
Corn Processing operating profit increased $374 million to $1.2 billion .  Included in the current period operating profit is a gain of approximately $25 million for corn hedge timing effects and $15 million of asset impairment charges; while the prior period included a charge of approximately $15 million for corn hedge time effects and $71 million of asset impairment charges.  Excluding these items, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit decreased $39 million primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by lower net corn costs.  Also contributing to the decrease were decreased co-products income, an additional $8 million in bad debt reserve and $7 million of startup costs related to the new sweetener facility in Tianjin, China.  Excluding corn hedge timing effects and asset impairment charges, Bioproducts profit in the current year improved by $317 million as solid demand for U.S. ethanol from domestic and export markets, lower net corn costs, and lower industry production volumes early in the year caused by logistical and production challenges combined to drive volatile but overall strong margins.
Agricultural Services operating profit increased $709 million to $1.1 billion .  Current year results in Merchandising and Handling include a gain of $156 million upon the Company's effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units and asset impairment charges of $14 million.  Prior year results included an approximately $30 million intercompany insurance-related gain and a $155 million asset impairment charge related to the other than temporary impairment of the Company's GrainCorp investment.  Excluding these items, Merchandising and Handling operating profit increased $353 million due principally to higher U.S. grain export volumes and improvement in international merchandising results.  Transportation operating profit improved $110 million to $187 million due to higher volumes and freight rates in barge operations.  Milling and Other results declined $21 million to $249 million on lower margins and volumes in the milling business for most of the year reducing opportunities for grain and feed merchandising.
Other processing operating profit reflects a loss of $46 million due primarily to the results of Wild Flavors and SCI which were acquired by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Wild Flavors' results include $33 million in restructuring charges and acquisition costs and $23 million in additional expense for the amortization of fair value adjustments primarily related to inventories.  Other financial operating profit increased $38 million to $79 million mainly due to the absence of an approximately $30 million insurance-related loss in the prior year which offset the insurance-related gain reported in the Agricultural Services segment.
Corporate results were a net charge of $785 million in the current year compared to a net charge of $684 million in the prior year.  The effects of decreasing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $245 million in the current year compared to a credit of $225 million in the prior year.  Interest expense - net declined $90 million due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.  Unallocated corporate costs increased $83 million primarily due to higher expenses related to the enterprise resource planning project, special strategic projects, and compensation accruals.  Other charges in the current year of $228 million consisted of losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated Wild Flavors acquisition, global headquarters relocation costs of $16 million, Toepfer integration and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million.  Other charges in the prior year of $147 million consisted of a $54 million provision related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp acquisition, $21 million of costs related to strategic merger and acquisition projects, and $32 million of costs primarily related to asset write-downs and reallocations of costs from the operating segments to corporate.  Minority interest and other expense increased $47 million primarily due to changes in the elimination of the income attributable to the minority shareholder of Toepfer.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Six Months Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2011 (Unaudited) Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $152 million to $692 million.Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs in the 2012 period decreased $115 million after tax ($206 million pretax).The 2012 period results also include gains of $49 million after tax related to the Companys interest in GrainCorp and a gain of $24 million after tax related to the sale of certain of the Companys exchange membership interests, partially offset by charges of $44 million after tax related to pension settlements.
Income taxes increased $66 million due to higher earnings before income taxes.The effective income tax rate of 30.4% in 2012 compares to the rate of 30.3% in the prior period.
Segment operating profit in the 2012 period increased $243 million due to a $318 million improvement in operating results in the Oilseeds Processing segment, the absence of the prior period asset impairment charges of $339 million in the Corn Processing segment related primarily to the write-down of assets at its Clinton, IA bioplastics facility, and higher results of the Companys Financial operations of $76 million, in part due to a gain on sale of certain of the Companys exchange membership interests and favorable captive insurance loss reserve adjustments.Partially offsetting these improvements were lower results in the 2012 period in Corn Processings bioproducts business of $408 million, excluding the Clinton, IA asset impairment charge discussed above, and the 2012 period loss of $146 million in the Agricultural Services segment related to the disposal of Gruma.
Corporate expenses were $27 million higher in the 2012 period, due primarily to $68 million of pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher returns on the Company's equity method investment in CIP.
Analysis of Statements of Earnings Processed volumes by product for the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in metric tons): Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2012 2011 Change Oilseeds 15,868 15,209 659 Corn 12,307 12,408 (101 ) Milling and cocoa 3,603 3,736 (133 ) Total 31,778 31,353 425 The Company continued to operate its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Revenues by segment for the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: Six Months Ended December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 Change (Unaudited) Oilseeds Processing Crushing and Origination $ 10,784 $ 8,927 $ 1,857 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other 5,256 6,218 (962 ) Cocoa and Other 1,746 1,952 (206 ) Asia 266 240 26 Total Oilseeds Processing 18,052 17,337 715 Corn Processing Sweeteners and Starches 2,405 2,316 89 Bioproducts 3,762 4,135 (373 ) Total Corn Processing 6,167 6,451 (284 ) Agricultural Services Merchandising and Handling 20,159 19,061 1,098 Transportation 128 149 (21 ) Milling and Other 2,154 2,154  Total Agricultural Services 22,441 21,364 1,077 Other Financial 69 56 13 Total Other 69 56 13 Total $ 46,729 $ 45,208 $ 1,521 As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results.From a demand perspective, protein meal demand continued to increase, particularly for U.S. domestic and export markets.Demand for soybeans was solid.Weaker U.S. gasoline demand and unfavorable global ethanol trade flows resulted in continued excess industry ethanol capacity.From a supply perspective, following below-average harvests in the 2011/2012 crop year in North and South America, corn and soybean supplies were tight and commodity market prices were generally higher.In South America, farmers responded to high crop prices with record soybean plantings for the 2012/2013 crop year.The lower corn harvest in the U.S. due to the drought led to higher corn prices and higher demand for corn from South America.
Revenues increased $1.5 billion to $46.7 billion.Higher average selling prices increased revenues by $4.9 billion, primarily due to increases in underlying commodity prices,while lower sales volumes, inclusive of the effects of acquisitions, reduced revenues by $2.4 billion.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenues by $1.0 billion.Oilseeds Processing sales increased 4% to $18.1 billion due principally to higher average selling prices of protein meal and soybeans and higher sales volumes of corn, primarily in South America, and protein meal.Corn Processing sales decreased 4% to $6.2 billion due principally to lower average selling prices of ethanol.Agricultural Services sales increased 5% to $22.4 billion, due to higher average selling prices of soybeans and wheat partially offset by lower sales volumes of corn.
Cost of products sold increased $1.6 billion to $44.9 billion due principally to higher prices of agricultural commodities partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and $1.1 billion related to the effects of changing foreign currency rates.Manufacturing expenses decreased $102 million or 3%, due principally to lower energy and repairs and maintenance costs, and savings in employee and benefit-related costs.
36 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39 million to $869 million.Included in selling, general, and administrative expenses are pension settlement charges of $68 million for the six months ended December 31, 2012.Excluding these pension settlement charges, selling, general, and administrative expenses declined $29 million or 3% due principally to lower employee and benefit-related costs.
Asset impairment charges in the 2012 period represent impairments of $146 million related to the Companys divestment of its equity method investments in Gruma and Gruma-related joint ventures.The prior year charges relate to the Companys Clinton, IA bioplastics facility.Property, plant, and equipment were written down to estimated fair value resulting in impairment charges of $320 million.In addition, charges of $32 million were recognized for exit activities and to impair other assets.
Other income increased $97 million to $109 million due primarily to $62 million of gains related to the Companys interest in GrainCorp and $39 million of gains on the sale of certain of the Companys exchange membership interests.
Operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: Six Months Ended December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 Change (Unaudited) Oilseeds Processing Crushing and Origination $ 517 $ 227 $ 290 Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other 78 132 (54 ) Cocoa and Other 65 (28 ) 93 Asia 87 98 (11 ) Total Oilseeds Processing 747 429 318 Corn Processing Sweeteners and Starches 191 105 86 Bioproducts (120 ) (51 ) (69 ) Total Corn Processing 71 54 17 Agricultural Services Merchandising and Handling 299 315 (16 ) Transportation 67 81 (14 ) Milling and Other 29 167 (138 ) Total Agricultural Services 395 563 (168 ) Other Financial 93 17 76 Total Other 93 17 76 Total Segment Operating Profit 1,306 1,063 243 Corporate (309 ) (282 ) (27 ) Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 997 $ 781 $ 216 37 Item 7.

Corn Processing operating profit increased $17 million to $71 million.The prior period results include $339 million in asset impairment charges and exit costs related to the Companys Clinton, IA bioplastics facility.Excluding the bioplastics charges and exit costs, Corn Processing operating profit declined $322 million.Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $86 million to $191 million, as tight sweetener industry capacity supported higher average selling prices.The prior period Sweeteners and Starches results were negatively impacted by higher net corn costs related to the mark-to-market timing effects of economic hedges.Bioproducts profit decreased $69 million to a $120 million loss.Excluding the $339 million prior year asset impairment charges, Bioproducts profit decreased $408 million.Weak domestic gasoline demand and unfavorable global ethanol trade flows resulted in continued excess industry capacity, keeping ethanol margins negative.
Agricultural Services operating profit, including the 2012 period $146 million Gruma asset impairment charge and $62 million gain on the Companys interest in GrainCorp, decreased $168 million to $395 million.Merchandising and Handling earnings decreased $16 million mostly due to weaker U.S. merchandising results impacted by the smaller U.S. harvest.Merchandising and Handling earnings in the 2012 period include the $62 million gain on the Companys interest in GrainCorp.Earnings from transportation operations decreased $14 million to $67 million due to increased barge operating expenses caused by low water on the Mississippi River partially offset by higher freight rates.Milling and Other operating profit decreased $138 million to $29 million due principally to a $146 million impairment charge on the disposal of the Companys equity method investments in Gruma and Gruma-related joint ventures.Milling results remained strong, and the Companys feed business saw improved margins amid stronger demand.
Other financial operating profit increased $76 million to $93 million mainly due to asset disposal gains for certain of the Companys exchange membership interests and improved results of the Companys captive insurance subsidiary.
Corporate expenses increased $27 million to $309 million in the 2012 period.The Company incurred $68 million in pension settlement charges related to a one-time window for lump sum distributions in the U.S. and the conversion of a Dutch pension plan to a multi-employer plan.Excluding these pension charges, corporate expenses declined by $41 million.Corporate interest expense - net increased $22 million mostly due to the absence of interest income received in the prior period related to a contingent gain settlement.Unallocated corporate costs were lower by $15 million primarily due to lower employee and employee benefit-related costs.The increase in other income of $56 million is primarily due to improved equity earnings from corporate affiliate investments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Year Ended June 30, 2012 Compared to Year Ended June 30, 2011 As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Companys operating results.From a demand perspective, global protein meal consumption has continued to grow although at a slower rate.Excess industry crushing production capacity has pressured oilseeds margins, and the Company has adjusted production rates regionally to balance supply with current market demand.Biodiesel markets supported global demand for refined and crude vegetable oils.In the U.S., high biodiesel inventories associated with the December 31, 2011, expiration of blenders incentives dampened margins in the second half of the fiscal year.U.S. corn sweetener exports continue to support sales volumes and margins.Ethanol sales volumes were supported by favorable gasoline blending economics in the U.S.However, excess industry production of ethanol, together with recently reduced U.S. ethanol export demand, has negatively impacted ethanol margins.From a supply perspective, crop supplies in certain key growing regions at the beginning of fiscal 2012, including South America and the Black Sea region, were adequate, but a smaller-than-normal harvest in North America in the fall of 2011 resulted in low U.S. carryover stocks for corn and soybeans.Because of the smaller than expected South American harvest, global supplies of corn and soybeans were more dependent on the North American harvest.While plantings of corn increased in the U.S. during fiscal 2012, the drought conditions late in the fiscal year decreased expectations for the size of the harvest.These factors, combined with concerns about the European debt situation and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, contributed to volatile commodity market price movements during fiscal 2012.
Net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.8 billion to $1.2 billion.Segment operating profit declined $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion amid more challenging conditions generally affecting all reportable segments.Segment operating profit in fiscal 2012 included $349 million of asset impairment charges and exit costs comprised of $335 million to exit the Companys Clinton, IA, bioplastics plant and $14 million to shut down its Walhalla, ND, ethanol dry mill.Earnings before income taxes included a credit of $10 million from the effect on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, including the liquidation of LIFO inventory layers, partially offset by increasing agricultural commodity prices, compared to charges of $368 million in the prior year.Fiscal 2012 unallocated corporate expenses included $71 million of charges related to the Companys global workforce reduction program.
Income taxes decreased $0.5 billion due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective income tax rate.The Companys effective income tax rate declined to 29.6% compared to 33.1% in the prior year primarily due to income tax benefits associated with foreign currency re-measurement of non-monetary assets partially offset by a geographic mix of earnings that shifted more to foreign jurisdictions.
Analysis of Statements of Earnings Processed volumes by product for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in metric tons): (In thousands) 2012 2011 Change Oilseeds 31,161 29,630 1,531 Corn 24,618 23,412 1,206 Milling and cocoa 7,156 7,179 (23 ) Total 62,935 60,221 2,714 The Company continued to operate its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.

Oilseeds Processing sales increased 16% to $34.7 billion due principally to higher average selling prices of vegetable oils, merchandised commodities, protein meal, and biodiesel and increased sales volumes of biodiesel, protein meal, and peanuts, in part due to the acquisition of Golden Peanut in December 2010.Corn Processing sales increased 22% to $12.1 billion due principally to higher average selling prices of ethanol and sweeteners as well as higher sales volumes of sugar and ethanol.Agricultural Services sales increased 3% to $42.1 billion, due to higher average selling prices of corn and wheat flour partially offset by lower sales volumes, in part due to lower export volumes from the U.S.
Cost of products sold increased 12% to $85.4 billion due principally to higher prices of agricultural commodities and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volumes.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced fiscal 2012 cost of products sold by $0.7 billion.Manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion due to higher costs for maintenance, employee and benefit-related expenses, energy, and chemicals.These higher costs were primarily due to higher production volumes, acquisitions, and higher unit costs for fuels and certain chemicals.Partially offsetting these higher costs was lower depreciation expense, in part due to the Companys change in estimated service lives for machinery and equipment during the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses remained steady at $1.6 billion.Loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award in the Companys Agricultural Services operating segment were partially offset by lower overhead expenses.
Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs of $449 million were comprised of $349 million in the Corn Processing segment related to the Companys exit from its Clinton, IA, bioplastics business and ethanol dry mill in Walhalla, ND, $71 million in Corporate for the global workforce reduction, and $29 million in Corporate for investment write-downs and other facility exit-related costs.
40 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Interest expense decreased 9% to $441 million primarily due to lower long-term debt balances, higher interest expense capitalized on construction projects in progress, and lower interest expense related to uncertain income tax positions.
Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased 13% to $472 million principally due to decreased equity earnings from the Companys equity investee, Gruma, which included a $78 million gain in the prior year related to Grumas disposal of certain assets.
Interest income declined 18% to $112 million primarily related to the sale and deconsolidation of the Hickory Point Bank and Trust Company, fsb, effective September 30, 2011.
Other income  net declined $101 million to $17 million due primarily to the absence of income recognized in the prior year period of $71 million for the Golden Peanut Gain and $30 million for gains on interest rate swaps.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $0.4 billion to $1.3 billion.Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased $284 million to $641 million primarily due to weaker results in European softseeds, lower results in North American softseeds, and lower North American positioning results.Partially offsetting these lower results, were higher grain origination results in South America driven by higher volumes and favorable positioning.Poor European softseed results were driven by a small prior year rapeseed crop, positioning losses, and weaker demand for protein meal and oils.North American softseed results declined primarily as a result of lower margins generated from a tight cottonseed supply.Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results declined $47 million to $295 million due primarily to declines in biodiesel margins in South America and Europe and lower margins for specialty fats and oils in Europe. These declines were partially offset by improved North American protein specialties and natural health and nutrition results due to higher margins and volumes.Cocoa and Other results declined $57 million to $183 million.Fiscal 2012 results in Cocoa and Other were reduced by $100 million for net unrealized mark-to-market losses related to certain forward purchase and sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.The prior year included $9 million of net unrealized mark-to-market losses.Excluding these timing effects, cocoa results improved in fiscal 2012 driven by improved press margins caused by strong cocoa powder demand.The prior year included the $71 million Golden Peanut Gain which was partially offset in fiscal 2012 by higher earnings in the Companys peanut business in part due to the first full year of consolidated results for Golden Peanut being reported by the Company in fiscal 2012.Asia results remained steady at $183 million, principally reflecting the Companys share of its results from equity investee, Wilmar.
Corn Processing operating results decreased $818 million to $261 million due principally to poor ethanol margins and $349 million in asset impairment charges and exit costs.Excluding the asset impairment and exit costs related to the Companys bioplastics business and Walhalla, ND, ethanol dry grind facility, Corn Processing operating profit of $610 million in fiscal 2012 represented a decline of $469 million compared to the prior year.Processed volumes were up 5 percent while net corn costs increased compared to the prior year.Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $5 million to $335 million, as higher average selling prices more than offset higher net corn costs.Bioproducts profit decreased $823 million to a loss of $74 million, including the $349 million asset impairment and exit charges.Lower ethanol margins were caused by excess supply as previously offline production restarted while industry demand declined, in part due to slowing export demand.Prior year bioproducts results were enhanced by favorable corn ownership positions, which lowered net corn costs in that period.Bioproducts results in the prior year were negatively impacted by startup costs of $94 million related to the Companys new dry-grind ethanol, bioplastics, and glycol plants.
Agricultural Services operating profits decreased $376 million to $947 million.Merchandising and Handling earnings decreased primarily due to lower results from U.S. operations.Lower sales volumes were principally the result of the relatively higher cost of U.S. grains and oilseeds in the global market due to lower stocks caused by a smaller U.S. harvest in 2011.This relatively weaker position led to reduced U.S. grain exports.In the prior year, Merchandising and Handling results were positively impacted by higher quantities of U.S. grain exports by the Company.In addition, fiscal 2012 included $40 million of increased loss provisions mainly due to an unfavorable arbitration award.Earnings from Transportation were steady.Prior years operating results in Milling and Other operations included a $78 million gain related to Grumas disposal of certain assets.
Other financial operating profit decreased $24 million to $15 million mainly due to higher loss provisions at the Companys captive insurance subsidiary related to property and crop risk reserves.
Corporate expenses declined $356 million to $760 million in fiscal 2012.The effects of a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers partially offset by increasing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $10 million in fiscal 2012 compared to a charge of $368 million in the prior year primarily due to higher prices.Corporate interest expense decreased $22 million primarily due to lower interest expense on lower long-term debt balances.Unallocated corporate costs include $71 million of costs related to the global workforce reduction program.Excluding these costs, unallocated corporate costs declined $37 million due primarily to lower administrative costs.Corporate other income increased due to higher investment income partially offset by $29 million for investment writedown and facility exit-related costs. Also, in the prior year the Company recognized $30 million of gains on interest rate swaps.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.The Company's strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the Companys control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures.  The primary source of funds to finance the Companys operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.
Cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 billion for 2014 compared to $5.2 billion in 2013 .  Working capital changes increased cash by $2.3 billion in the current year and by $2.9 billion in the prior year.  Inventories declined approximately $1.3 billion at December31, 2014 compared to December31, 2013 due to lower prices.  Cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion this year compared to $0.6 billion last year primarily due to capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired of $3.7 billion this year compared to $1.0 billion last year.  Cash used in financing activities was $3.6 billion this year compared to $3.2 billion last year.  In the current period, long-term debt payments increased as the $1.15 billion convertible debt matured in February 2014 and was paid with available cash.
At December31, 2014 , the Company had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.7 to 1.Included in working capital is $5.9 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.At December31, 2014 , the Companys capital resources included shareholders' equity of $19.6 billion and lines of credit totaling $6.6 billion which was unused.The Companys ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at December31, 2014 and 21% at December31, 2013 .The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Companys long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.The Companys ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders equity) was 17% at December31, 2014 and 14% at December31, 2013 .Of the Companys total lines of credit, $4.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2014 .
As of December31, 2014 , the Company had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.  Based on the Company's historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $4.0 billion , the Company has asserted that these funds are permanently reinvested outside the U.S.
The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs ( the Programs) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  The Programs provide the Company with up to $1.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Companys access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 20 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs).  As of December31, 2014 , the Company utilized $1.6 billion of its facility under the Programs.
On November 5, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2014.The Company has acquired approximately 59.8 million shares under this program, including 25.4 million shares acquired in 2014.  On November 5, 2014, the Companys Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019.
The Company expects capital expenditures of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion during 2015.  In 2015, the Company expects an additional cash outlay of approximately $0.7 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in share repurchases target, subject to strategic capital requirements.
The Companys credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December31, 2014 .

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company's credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.
Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.The following table sets forth the Companys significant future obligations by time period.Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Companys normal business activities.The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $72 million as of December31, 2014 as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.Where applicable, information included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.

At December31, 2014 , the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.7 billion through fiscal year 2019 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.
The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $980 million at December31, 2014 .
The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments.The Companys liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.At December31, 2014 , these contingent obligations totaled approximately $27 million .
44 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs Since March 2012, the Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the Program) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers).Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC (ADM Receivables).ADM Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $1.2 billion , as amended, billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Program terminates on June 26, 2015, unless extended.
In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the Second Program) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the Second Purchasers).  Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (ADM Ireland Receivables).  ADM Ireland Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.    In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $0.4 billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Second Program terminates on March 20, 2015, unless extended.
Under the Program and Second Program (collectively, the Programs), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables.
The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.At December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.
As of December31, 2014 and 2013 , the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Companys consolidated balance sheet was $2.1 billion , and $1.9 billion , respectively.  In exchange for the transfer, as of December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company received cash of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets of $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion , respectively.  Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $36.4 billion , $39.8 billion , $21.9 billion , and $8.9 billion for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012, respectively.  Of this amount, $35.1 billion , $39.8 billion , $21.9 billion , and $8.9 billion pertain to cash collections on the deferred consideration for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, the six months ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended June 30, 2012, respectively.  Deferred consideration is paid to the Company in cash on behalf of the Purchasers and Second Purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as these are revolving facilities, cash collected from the Companys customers is reinvested by the Purchasers and Second Purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the Programs.
The Companys risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the Program is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding.The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant.
Transfers of receivables under the Program during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012, resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $5 million , $4 million , $4 million , and $4 million , respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
45 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The Company reflects all cash flows related to the Program as operating activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Companys trade receivables.
Synthetic Leasing Program The Company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its U.S. barge and trucking assets for periods ranging from 5 to 7 years.  As of December31, 2014 , outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying assets of $143 million, were off-balance sheet.  These agreements provide the Company with the right to use these assets for specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments.  The agreements are accounted for as operating leases, such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.  The future lease payments pertaining to these lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in Item 7.  These leasing programs are utilized primarily to diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility.  The Company recorded $5 million and $3 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease payments for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 .
Critical Accounting Policies The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.These estimates and judgments are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.Certain of the Companys accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Companys financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.Management has discussed with the Companys Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Companys financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives Certain of the Companys inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December31, 2014 are valued at estimated fair values, including $4.7 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.9 billion of derivative assets, $0.9 billion of derivative liabilities, and $0.7 billion of inventory-related payables.Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities.  Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.The Companys inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $1.7 billion of assets and $0.3 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 3 in Item 8.Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.
Derivatives  Designated Hedging Activities The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Companys anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.These designated hedging programs principally relate to the Companys Corn Processing operating segment.Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.See Note 4 in Item 8 for additional information.
46 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Investments in Affiliates The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 17.3% investment in Wilmar.These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.If management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the Company recognizes may materially differ.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company.The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).
Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Companys income statement.The realization of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.  Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely.  During 2014, the Company increased valuation allowances by approximately $18 million primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards.  To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Companys effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.
Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and the Companys share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $8.6 billion at December31, 2014 , are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
47 Item 7.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Property, Plant, and Equipment and Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.Both the availability of the Companys raw materials and the demand for the Companys finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Companys raw materials and finished products.Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Companys assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.Management evaluates the Companys property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.During the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $35 million , $84 million , $0 million , $337 million , and $367 million , respectively (see Note 19 in Item 8 for additional information).
Business Combinations The Companys acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended .
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations , are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Although managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  As of December 31, 2014, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.  For fiscal years ended on June 30, 2012 and prior, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on April 1 (see Note 1 in Item 8 for additional information regarding this change in accounting policy).Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 25 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.
Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.The Company provides eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage while others are provided with Health Care Reimbursement Accounts).In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.These estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience combined with managements knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.At December31, 2014 , a new mortality table was used to estimate anticipated mortality rates that contributed to an increase in projected benefit obligations of approximately $0.2 billion .  See Note 15 in Item 8 for additional information.
48 Item 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in the Companys market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Companys net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below.
Commodities The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.
The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, its business operations, by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Companys overall short or long commodity position.Additionally, the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.
The Companys commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements, net of sales.
The fair value of the Companys commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period.Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.
In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows: December31, 2014 December31, 2013 Long/(Short) Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk (In millions) Highest position $ (97 ) $ (10 ) $ 660 $ 66 Lowest position (1,672 ) (167 ) (1,833 ) (183 ) Average position (837 ) (84 ) (959 ) (96 ) The decrease in fair value of the average position for December31, 2014 was the result of the decrease in commodity prices and the decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position.
49 Item 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) Currencies The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in 79 countries.For the majority of the Companys subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland and Brazil where the Euro and U.S. dollar are the functional currencies, respectively.To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real currencies.These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.The Company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options.The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.
The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is $8.0 billion at December31, 2014 , and $7.8 billion at December31, 2013 .This increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar of $0.9 billion.The potential loss in fair value, which would principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $802 million and $779 million for December31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.Actual results may differ.
Interest The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates.Actual results may differ.
December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (In millions) Fair value of long-term debt $ 6,872 $ 6,272 Excess of fair value over carrying value 1,314 925 Market risk 337 326 The increase in fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2014 is primarily due to decreased interest rates.

56 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.
Change in Fiscal Year On May3, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company determined that, in accordance with its Bylaws and upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Companys fiscal year shall begin on January1 and end on December31 of each year, starting on January1, 2013. The required transition period of July1, 2012 to December31, 2012 is included in this Form 10-K report.Amounts included in this report for the six months ended December 31, 2011 are unaudited.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.The Companys portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Companys year end and are consistent from period to period.
The Company consolidates Alfred C. Toepfer International (Toepfer), a wholly owned subsidiary, in which prior to June 6, 2014, the Company had an 80% interest, for which the minority interest was subject to a mandatorily redeemable put option.As a result of the put option, the associated minority interest was reported in other long-term liabilities.On December 31, 2011, the put option expired and the Company reclassified $174 million of minority interest from other long-term liabilities to noncontrolling interests in shareholders equity at that date.  During 2013, Toepfer became subject to a new mandatorily redeemable put option; and as a result, the Company reclassified $180 million of noncontrolling interest in shareholders' equity to long-term liabilities.  On June 6, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in Toepfer for $157 million .  The excess of the purchase price over the carrying value of the associated noncontrolling interest of $12 million was recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Affiliates goodwill of $198 million in 2013, previously included in goodwill and other intangible assets, have been reclassified to investments in and advances to affiliates.  There was no change in total investments and other assets as a result of this reclassification.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
57 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Segregated Cash and Investments The Company segregates certain cash and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, insurance arrangements, and lending arrangements.These segregated balances represent deposits received from customers of the Companys registered futures commission merchant, securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash and securities pledged as security under certain insurance or lending arrangements.Segregated cash and investments primarily consist of cash, United States government securities, and money-market funds.
Receivables The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts of $81 million at December31, 2014 and 2013 , to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances.The Company estimates this allowance based on its history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its relationships with, and the economic status of, its customers.Portions of the allowance for uncollectible accounts are recorded in trade receivables, other current assets, and other assets.
Credit risk on receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Companys worldwide customer base.The Company manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.Collateral is generally not required for the Companys receivables.
Accounts receivable due from unconsolidated affiliates as of December31, 2014 and 2013 was $15 million and $73 million , respectively.
Inventories Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, or market.
The following table sets forth the Company's inventories as of December31, 2014 and 2013 .
December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (In millions) LIFO inventories FIFO value $ 1,199 $ 1,408 LIFO valuation reserve (53 ) (297 ) LIFO inventories carrying value 1,146 1,111 FIFO inventories 3,058 3,741 Market inventories 4,699 6,059 Supplies and other inventories 471 530 Total inventories $ 9,374 $ 11,441 58 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Fair Value Measurements The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
Based on historical experience with the Companys suppliers and customers, the Companys own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the contract in Level 3.
In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
The Companys policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.
Derivatives The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.The majority of the Companys derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments; and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument that is in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion), hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the underlying are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.
59 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Marketable Securities The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income.The Company monitors its investments for impairment periodically, and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other-than-temporary.  The Company uses the specific identification method when securities are sold or reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.The Company considers marketable securities maturing in less than one year as short-term.All other marketable securities are classified as long-term.
Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 10 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 30 years.The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of $18 million , $16 million , $12 million , $9 million , and $21 million for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012, respectively.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 25 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Prior to the fiscal year end change transition period, the Companys accounting policy was to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on April 1 of each fiscal year or whenever there were indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.Effective in the transition period ended December 31, 2012, the Company voluntarily changed its accounting policy to begin conducting the annual goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment tests on October 1.  The change to the annual goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment testing date is preferable under the circumstances as the new impairment testing date is better aligned with the timing of the Companys annual strategic, planning, and budgeting process, and the timing is more closely aligned with the Companys annual financial reporting process as a result of the change in year end.The resulting change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge of the Companys goodwill.As it is impracticable to objectively determine the estimates and assumptions necessary to perform the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 for periods prior to October 1, 2012, the Company  prospectively applied the annual goodwill impairment testing date effective October 1, 2012.During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill of $9 million related to the Company's Brazilian sugar milling business.  There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014, the six months ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended June 30, 2012.
60 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Company's ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.During the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the year ended June 30, 2012, impairment charges were $35 million , $84 million , $0 million , $337 million , and $367 million , respectively (see Note 19 for additional information).
Payables to Brokerage Customers Payables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Company's futures commission merchant with credit or positive balances.  Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purpose as required by the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties.  Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets.
Revenues The Company follows a policy of recognizing sales revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.The Company has sales contracts that allow for pricing to occur after title of the goods has passed to the customer.In these cases, the Company continues to report the goods in inventory until it recognizes the sales revenue once the price has been determined.Freight costs and handling charges related to sales are recorded as a component of cost of products sold.
Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012, were $5.8 billion , $6.9 billion , $4.0 billion , $4.5 billion , and $7.7 billion , respectively.
Stock Compensation The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.The Companys stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options.The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively.These valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award.
Research and Development Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were $79 million , $59 million , $28 million , $29 million , and $56 million for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012, respectively.
Per Share Data Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method.
61 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Business Combinations The Companys acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended .
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations , are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded with a corresponding offset to goodwill.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted the amended guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes , which requires the Company to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.  In situations where a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction or if the Company does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability in the financial statements and should not be combined with deferred tax assets.  The adoption of this amended guidance does not have an impact on the Companys financial results.
Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830), which requires the Company to transfer currency translation adjustments from other comprehensive income into net income in certain circumstances.  The amended guidance aims to resolve diversity in practice as to whether ASC Topic 810, Consolidation or Topic 830 applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on the Companys current period results.  If the Company disposes all or part of a qualifying foreign entity, it will be required to release the portion of cumulative translation adjustment applicable to the disposed entity.
Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 405, Liabilities , which addresses the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements, for which the total amount under the arrangement is fixed at the reporting date.  The amended guidance aims to resolve diversity in practice among companies that are subject to joint and several liabilities.  The retrospective adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on current and prior period results and is not expected to have any material impact on the Companys financial results.
Effective October 1, 2014, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , which limit the definition of discontinued operations as only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results.  The amended guidance also expands the definition of discontinued operations to include a business or nonprofit activity that, on acquisition, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale and a disposal of an equity method investment that meets the definition of discontinued operations. The amended guidance requires the Company to report discontinued operations if (1) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity meets the criteria in Topic 205 to be classified as held for sale; (2) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of by sale; or (3) the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed other than by sale.  As a result of  the prospective adoption of this amended guidance, the global chocolate and cocoa businesses that were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2014 (see Note 18 for more information) were not reported as discontinued operations.  The Company does not believe the sale of these businesses to have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results.
62 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Pending Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2016, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which seeks to resolve the diversity in practice that exists when accounting for share-based payments.  The amended guidance requires a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period to be treated as a performance condition.  The Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance either prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding  as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to impact financial results.
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition .  Topic 606 requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance requires the Company to apply the following steps:  (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  The Company will be required to adopt Topic 606 either on a full retrospective basis to each prior reporting period presented or on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application.  If the Company elects the modified retrospective approach, it will be required to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes.  The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 2.Acquisitions Operating results of acquisitions are included in the Companys financial statements from the date of acquisition and are not significant to the Companys consolidated operating results.
Fiscal Year 2014 acquisitions On October 1, 2014 and November 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of the WILD Flavors businesses (Wild Flavors) and Specialty Commodities Inc. (SCI), respectively.  Both acquisitions are in line with the Company's strategy to increase returns and reduce earnings volatility through the growth of its specialty ingredient offerings.  The 2014 post acquisition financial results of Wild Flavors and SCI are reported in the Other segment.
63 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2.Acquisitions (Continued) During theyearended December31, 2014, the Company acquired six businesses, including Wild Flavors and SCI, for a total cost of $3.0 billion .  The purchase price net of cash acquired of $280 million was preliminarily allocated as follows: (In millions) Wild Flavors SCI Others Total Trade receivables $ 176 $ 48 $ 8 $ 232 Inventories 286 72 25 383 Other current assets 64 2  66 Goodwill 1,698 59 15 1,772 Other intangible assets 1,103 46 35 1,184 Property, plant, and equipment 423 10 30 463 Other assets 68 6  74 Short-term debt (215 )  (1 ) (216 ) Trade payables (128 ) (25 ) (1 ) (154 ) Accrued expenses and other payables (214 ) (14 ) (10 ) (238 ) Long-term debt (238 )  (3 ) (241 ) Deferred income taxes (378 ) (16 )  (394 ) Other liabilities (173 )   (173 ) Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 2,472 $ 188 $ 98 $ 2,758 Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the Companys acquisition of the businesses.
Of the $1.8 billion preliminarily allocated to goodwill, $15 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The following table sets forth the preliminary fair values and weighted average useful lives of the other intangible assets acquired.
Weighted Average Useful Life Wild Flavors SCI Others Total (In years) (In millions) Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Trademarks/brands $ 238 $  $ 12 $ 250 Intangible assets with finite lives: Patents 15  3  3 Customer lists 15 552 36 21 609 Recipes and other 15 313 7 2 322 Total other intangible assets acquired $ 1,103 $ 46 $ 35 $ 1,184 The Company's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the post acquisition results of Wild Flavors which were immaterial.
64 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2.Acquisitions (Continued) Fiscal Year 2013 acquisitions During theyearended December31, 2013, the Company acquired four businesses for a total cost of $44 million and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.  The net cash purchase price for the acquisitions of $44 million was preliminarily allocated to working capital, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other long-term assets for $6 million , $29 million , $2 million , and $7 million , respectively.  The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions did not result in material adjustments.
Transition Period 2012 Acquisitions During the six months ended December 31, 2012, the Company made eight acquisitions for a total cost of $26 million in cash and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.The net cash purchase price for these eight acquisitions of $26 million was preliminarily allocated to working capital, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other long-term assets for $4 million , $24 million , $2 million , and $(4) million , respectively.  The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions did not result in material adjustments.
Fiscal Year 2012 Acquisitions During fiscal year 2012, the Company made nine acquisitions for a total cost of $241 million in cash and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.The net cash purchase price for these nine acquisitions of $241 million was allocated to working capital, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, other long-term assets, and long-term liabilities for $(12) million , $199 million , $51 million , $6 million , and $3 million , respectively. The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions did not result in material adjustments.There was no single material acquisition during the year.
65 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.Fair Value Measurements The following tables set forth, by level, the Companys assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2014 and 2013 .
Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2014 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (In millions) Assets: Inventories carried at market $  $ 3,208 $ 1,491 $ 4,699 Unrealized derivative gains: Commodity contracts  487 203 690 Foreign exchange contracts  186  186 Interest rate contracts  21  21 Cash equivalents 491   491 Marketable securities 860 80  940 Segregated investments 2,158   2,158 Deferred consideration  511  511 Total Assets $ 3,509 $ 4,493 $ 1,694 $ 9,696 Liabilities: Unrealized derivative losses: Commodity contracts $  $ 564 $ 212 $ 776 Foreign exchange contracts  150  150 Inventory-related payables  612 40 652 Total Liabilities $  $ 1,326 $ 252 $ 1,578 66 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.Fair Value Measurements (Continued) Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2013 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total (In millions) Assets: Inventories carried at market $  $ 4,247 $ 1,812 $ 6,059 Unrealized derivative gains: Commodity contracts 31 540 279 850 Foreign exchange contracts 30 88  118 Interest rate contracts  1  1 Cash equivalents 2,518   2,518 Marketable securities 881 26  907 Segregated investments 1,707   1,707 Deferred consideration  757  757 Total Assets $ 5,167 $ 5,659 $ 2,091 $ 12,917 Liabilities: Unrealized derivative losses: Commodity contracts $ 45 $ 343 $ 261 $ 649 Foreign exchange contracts  166  166 Interest rate contracts  9  9 Inventory-related payables  708 34 742 Total Liabilities $ 45 $ 1,226 $ 295 $ 1,566 Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets, broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.Market valuations for the Companys inventories are adjusted for location and quality because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.
67 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.Fair Value Measurements (Continued) Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies.Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.The majority of the Companys exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables.Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.These differences are generally determined using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expensenet.The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur.
The Company's cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1.
The Companys marketable securities are comprised of  equity investments, U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government agencies, and other debt securities.Publicly traded equity investments and U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.U.S. government agency obligations and corporate and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and substantially all are classified in Level 2.Unrealized changes in the fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) unless a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings.
The Company's segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.
The Company has deferred consideration under its accounts receivable securitization programs (the Programs) which represents a note receivable from the purchasers under the Programs.This amount is reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see Notes 6 and 20).The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received.The fair value is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant.
68 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.Fair Value Measurements (Continued) The following tables present a rollforward of the activity of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 .

For all periods presented, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10%  threshold.Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2.
70 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.Fair Value Measurements (Continued) In some cases, the price components of inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable.These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms.In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as Basis.  The changes in unobservable price components are determined by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these unobservable price components.
The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Companys Level 3 valuations as of December31, 2014 and 2013 .The Companys Level 3 measurements may include Basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components.As an example, for Level 3 inventories with Basis, the unobservable component is a weighted average 23.4% of the total price for assets and 43.4% for liabilities.
Weighted Average % of Total Price December31, 2014 December31, 2013 Component Type Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Inventories Basis 23.4% 43.4% 21.9% 13.2% Transportation cost 4.9% 15.2% 12.3% % Commodity Derivative Contracts Basis 13.5% 13.6% 22.8% 17.6% Transportation cost 10.2% 19.5% 32.5% 12.3% In certain of the Companys principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts.These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price.In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources.In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100 percent unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3.
Note 4.Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The majority of the Company's derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.Derivatives, including exchange traded contracts and physical purchase or sale contracts, and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.Inventory is not a derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below.
71 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4.Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued) The following table sets forth the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of December31, 2014 and 2013 .

During December 2012, the Company entered into two transactions with investment bank counterparties resulting in an economic interest in GrainCorp shares.  The purpose of these transactions was to facilitate the Companys  planned acquisition of GrainCorp, which was rejected by the Australian Federal Treasurer in November 2013.One of the transactions was accounted for as an unfunded derivative instrument.The other transaction was a hybrid financial instrument, as defined by applicable accounting standards, whereby the accounting rules required the Company to account for a funded host instrument and a separate embedded derivative instrument. In December 2012, the Company settled the derivative instruments known as Total Return Swaps, and recognized pre-tax gains reported as Other Contracts in the table above.After the settlement of these transactions, the interest in GrainCorp is recorded as a long-term marketable security.
72 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4.Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued) Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately.
Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedging Strategies As of December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company has certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.
The Company uses interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to protect the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying fixed-rate debt are recorded in other (income) expense - net.   The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt resulting in no ineffectiveness.    At December31, 2014 , the Company has $21 million in other current assets representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding increase in the underlying debt for the same amount with no impact to earnings.
For each of the commodity hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.Assuming normal market conditions, the changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains/losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues, cost of products sold, interest expense or other (income) expense  net, as applicable.As of December31, 2014 , the Company has $30 million of after-tax gains in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash flow hedge transactions.The Company expects to recognize the $30 million of gains in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months.
The Company uses futures or options contracts to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Companys forecasted purchases of corn.The Companys corn processing plants currently grind approximately 76 million bushels of corn per month.During the past 12 months , the Company hedged between 24% and 71% of its monthly anticipated grind.At December31, 2014 , the Company has designated hedges representing between 0.3% to 23% of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 12 months .
The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts.  The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Companys sales of ethanol.  During the past 12 months , the Company hedged between 9 million and 121 million gallons of ethanol sales per month under these programs.At December31, 2014 , the Company has designated hedges representing between 1 million to 30 million gallons of ethanol sales per month over the next 6 months .
The following tables set forth the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments as of December31, 2014 and 2013 .

As an example, if the change in the price of a corn futures contract is strongly correlated to the change in the cash price paid for corn, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred and recognized at the time the corn grind occurs.

86 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13.Income Taxes (Continued) The Company has $76 million and $26 million of tax assets related to excess foreign tax credits at December31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which begin to expire in 2015.The Company has $70 million and $74 million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal tax benefit, at December31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which will expire at various times through fiscal 2034. The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the excess foreign tax credits at December31, 2014 .Due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $51 million and $53 million related to state income tax assets net of federal tax benefit as of December31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2013 and 2014.
Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and the Companys share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $8.6 billion at December31, 2014 , are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these undistributed earnings.
The following table sets forth a rollforward of activity of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December31, 2014 and 2013 as follows: Unrecognized Tax Benefits December31, 2014 December31, 2013 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 66 $ 77 Additions related to current years tax positions 5  Additions related to prior years tax positions 7 7 Reductions related to prior years tax positions (3 )  Reductions related to lapse of statute of limitations  (6 ) Settlements with tax authorities (3 ) (12 ) Ending balance $ 72 $ 66 The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table include effects related to net income and shareholders equity.The changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Companys net income or cash flow.
At December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $21 million and $18 million , respectively.
The Company is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world.Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete.Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions.However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Companys effective income tax rate in any given period.If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a reduction of $62 million on the tax expense for that period.
87 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13.Income Taxes (Continued) The Company is subject to routine examination by domestic and foreign tax authorities and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiation with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential additional tax owed by the Company in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.However, the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations.
The Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil), has received three separate tax assessments from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (BFRS) challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses for the tax years 2004, 2006 and 2007.  As of December31, 2014 , these assessments, updated for estimated penalties, interest, and variation in currency exchange rates, totaled approximately $493 million .  ADM do Brasils tax return for 2005 was also audited and no assessment was received.The statute of limitations for 2005 and 2008 has expired.  If the BFRS were to challenge commodity hedging deductions in tax years after 2008, the Company estimates it could receive additional tax assessments of approximately $57 million (based on currency exchange rates as of December31, 2014 ).
ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains, which are included in ADM do Brasils calculations of taxable income in Brazil, and losses, which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore, the Company has continued to recognize the tax benefit from hedging losses in its financial statements and has not recorded any tax liability for the amounts assessed by the BFRS.
ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the appeal panel found in favor of the BFRS on the 2004 assessment and ADM do Brasil filed a second level administrative appeal, which is still ongoing.  In January of 2012, the appeal panel found in favor of the BFRS on the 2006 and 2007 assessments and ADM do Brasil filed a second level administrative appeal, which is still ongoing.  If ADM do Brasil continues to be unsuccessful in the administrative appellate process, it intends to file appeals in the Brazilian federal courts.  While the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of, and expense for, income tax and the associated interest and penalties.
The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2008.
The Companys subsidiaries in Argentina have received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports totaling $93 million (inclusive of interest and adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates) for the tax years 2004 through 2007.The Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  While the Company believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws, it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2007, and estimates that these potential assessments would be approximately $325 million (as of December31, 2014 and subject to variation in currency exchange rates). The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2007.  The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax position would be sustained, and accordingly, the Company has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments.
In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based upon their technical merits.  The Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability for these assessments partly because the taxing jurisdictions' processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company's consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted, may take many years to resolve, and could result in financial impacts of up to the entire amount of these assessments.
88 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14.Leases The Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real estate, transportation assets, and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, the majority of which expire at various dates through the year 2044. Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012 was $224 million , $199 million , $106 million , $103 million , and $209 million , respectively.Additional amounts incurred for charges pertaining to time charters of ocean going vessels accounted for as leases for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the year ended June 30, 2012 were $136 million , $147 million , $62 million , $76 million , and $164 million , respectively.Future minimum rental payments for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows: Minimum Rental Payments (In millions) 2015 $ 226 2016 198 2017 158 2018 106 2019 59 Thereafter 240 Total minimum lease payments $ 987 Note 15.Employee Benefit Plans The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain foreign subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.The Company provides eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are grandfathered into subsidized coverage while others are provided with Health Care Reimbursement Accounts as described below).
On August 5, 2014, the Company amended its U.S. qualified pension plans and began notifying certain eligible individuals of its offer to pay those individuals pension benefit in a lump sum.  Individuals eligible for the voluntary lump sum payment option are generally those who are retirees, surviving joint annuitants, beneficiaries, and alternate payees of the U.S. qualified pension plans who are currently receiving a payment and commenced their benefit prior to June 30, 2014.  The voluntary lump sum which amounted to $296 million reduced the Company's global pension benefit obligation by $336 million resulting in a net improvement of its pension underfunding by $40 million .  The Company incurred a non-cash pre-tax income statement charge of $98 million in the quarter ended December31, 2014 as a result of the requirement to expense the unrealized actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) pertaining to liabilities settled at December31, 2014.
The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 1% of pay to eligible participants.Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in ADM stock as part of their own investment elections.The employer contributions are expensed when paid.Assets of the Companys 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.The Companys 401(k) plans held 11 million shares of Company common stock at December31, 2014 , with a market value of $596 million .Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the year ended December31, 2014 were $12 million .

The prior service cost and actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during 2015 is $2 million and $68 million , respectively.
92 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Included in accumulated other comprehensive income for postretirement benefits at December31, 2014 , are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $85 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $80 million .Prior service credit of $18 million and actuarial loss of $7 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during 2015.
The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing net periodic pension cost: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December31 2014 December31 2013 December31 2014 December31 2013 Discount rate 4.6% 3.9% 4.4% 3.6% Expected return on plan assets 7.0% 7.0% N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 3.9% 3.9% N/A N/A The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing the year-end actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits December31 2014 December31 2013 December31 2014 December31 2013 Discount rate 3.5 % 4.6 % 3.8% 4.4% Rate of compensation increase 3.8 % 3.9 % N/A N/A At December31, 2014 , a new mortality table was used to estimate anticipated mortality rates that contributed to an increase in projected benefit obligations of approximately $0.2 billion .
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2.9 billion , $2.6 billion , and $1.7 billion , respectively as of December31, 2014 , and $2.2 billion , $2.0 billion , and $1.6 billion , respectively, as of December31, 2013 .The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2.8 billion , $2.5 billion , and $1.7 billion , respectively, as of December31, 2014 and $2.1 billion , $1.9 billion , and $1.6 billion , respectively, as of December31, 2013 .The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of December31, 2014 and 2013 , was $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion , respectively.
For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.25% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the year ended December31, 2014 .The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by 2024 and remain at that level thereafter.  The credits used to fund certain retirees with Health Reimbursement Accounts are indexed up to a maximum of 3% per year.
A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 1% Increase 1% Decrease (In millions) Effect on combined service and interest cost components $ 1 $ (1 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligations $ 8 $ (7 ) 93 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) Plan Assets The Companys employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments: Common stock: Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
Mutual funds: Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
Common collective trust (CCT) funds: The fair values of the CCTs are based on the cumulative net asset value (NAV) of their underlying investments. The investments in CCTs are comprised of international equity funds, a small cap U.S. equity fund, large cap U.S. equity funds, fixed income funds, and other funds.The fund units are valued at NAV based on the closing market value of the units bought or sold as of the valuation date and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The CCTs seek primarily to provide investment results approximating the aggregate price, dividend performance, total return, and income stream of underlying investments of the funds.Issuances and redemptions of certain of the CCT investments may be restricted by date and/or amount.
Corporate debt instruments: Corporate debt instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
U.S.Treasury instruments: U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds: U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
94 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of plan assets as of December31, 2014 and 2013 .

96 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) The following table sets forth the actual asset allocation for the Companys global pension plan assets as of the measurement date: December 31 2014 (1)(2) December 31 2013 (2) Equity securities 51% 54% Debt securities 48% 45% Other 1% 1% Total 100% 100% (1) The Companys U.S. pension plans contain approximately 62% of the Companys global pension plan assets.The actual asset allocation for the Companys U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities.The target asset allocation for the Companys U.S. pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.The actual asset allocation for the Companys foreign pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 38% equity securities, 60% debt securities, and 2% in other investments.The target asset allocation for the Companys foreign pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.
(2) The Companys pension plans did not hold any shares of Company common stock as of the December31, 2014 and 2013 measurement dates.
Investment objectives for the Companys plan assets are to:  Optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk.
Maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers.
Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.
Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.
Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable.In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.
The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Companys plan assets.To develop the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.
Contributions and Expected Future Benefit Payments Based on actuarial calculations, the Company expects to contribute $38 million to the pension plans and $12 million to the postretirement benefit plan during 2015.The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period.
97 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.Employee Benefit Plans (Continued) The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the benefit plans: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits (In millions) 2015 $ 97 $ 12 2016 103 13 2017 108 13 2018 115 13 2019 122 14 2020  2024 721 75 Note 16.Shareholders' Equity The Company has authorized one billion shares of common stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, each with zero par value.No preferred stock has been issued.At December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had approximately 79.4 million shares and 57.5 million shares, respectively, of its common shares in treasury.Treasury stock of $2.7 billion and $1.6 billion at December31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, is recorded at cost as a reduction of common stock.

On December 15, 2014, the Company also announced that it has reached an agreement to sell its global cocoa business to Olam International Limited for $1.3 billion , subject to customary conditions.  Both transactions are expected to close in 2015.  Assets and liabilities subject to the purchase and sale agreements have been classified as held for sale in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014.  The global chocolate and cocoa businesses do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations at December 31, 2014 under the amended guidance of ASC Topics 205 and 360 which the Company early adopted on October 1, 2014 because these businesses do not comprise a major component of the Company's operations.  Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell.  As of December 31, 2014. the carrying value of the cocoa and chocolate assets were less than fair value less costs to sell, and accordingly, no adjustment to the asset value was necessary.  The gain or loss on disposal, along with the continuing operations of the disposal group, will be reported in the Oilseeds Processing segment.

Note 20.Sale of Accounts Receivable Since March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program (the Program) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers).Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC (ADM Receivables).ADM Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $1.2 billion , as amended, and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Program terminates on June 26, 2015, unless extended.
In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the Second Program) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the Second Purchasers).  Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (ADM Ireland Receivables).  ADM Ireland Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.    In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $0.4 billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Second Program terminates on March 20, 2015, unless extended.
Under the Program and Second Program (collectively, the Programs), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables.
The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.  The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.  At December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.
107 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 20.Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued) As of December31, 2014 and 2013 , the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Companys consolidated balance sheet was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion , respectively.In exchange for the transfer as of December31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company received cash of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion , respectively.Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $36.4 billion , $39.8 billion , $21.9 billion , and $8.9 billion for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012, respectively.Of this amount, $35.1 billion , $39.8 billion , $21.9 billion , and $8.9 billion pertain to cash collections on the deferred consideration for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012, respectively.  Deferred consideration is paid to the Company in cash on behalf of the Purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as this is a revolving facility, cash collected from the Companys customers is reinvested by the Purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the Program.
The Companys risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the Program is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding.The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement under the applicable accounting standards) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant.
Transfers of receivables under the Program during the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012 resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $5 million , $4 million , $4 million , and $4 million , respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
The Company reflects all cash flows related to the Program as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Companys trade receivables.
Note 21.Legal Proceedings, Guarantees, and Commitments The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, including with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations relating to the environment and, at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.
On April 22, 2011, certain manufacturers and distributors of sugar cane and beet sugar products filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against the Company, other manufacturers and marketers of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and the Corn Refiners Association, alleging that the defendants falsely claimed that HFCS is natural and nutritionally equivalent to sugar.  The defendants have filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs.  The parties are currently engaged in pretrial proceedings.
108 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 21.Legal Proceedings, Guarantees, and Commitments (Continued) The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligations.The Company has not recorded a liability for payment of these contingent obligations, as the Company believes the fair value of these contingent obligations is immaterial.The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.These contingent obligations totaled $27 million at December31, 2014 .

110 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Decatur, Illinois We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) as of December31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six-month period ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company at December31, 2014 and 2013 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Archer-Daniels-Midland Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February20, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP St. Louis, Missouri February20, 2015 111 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Decatur, Illinois We have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Companys (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Archer-Daniels-Midland Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of WILD Flavors Gmbh and Specialty Commodities Inc., which are included in the 2014 consolidated financial statements of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and constituted 6.4% and 9.1% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December31, 2014 and  0.4% and 2.8% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of WILD Flavors Gmbh and Specialty Commodities Inc.
In our opinion, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company as of December31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013 , the six months ended December 31, 2012, and the year ended June 30, 2012, of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, and our report dated February20, 2015 , expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Item 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of December31, 2014 , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)).Based on that evaluation, the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
On October 1, 2014 and November 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of WILD Flavors Gmbh (Wild Flavors)and Specialty Commodities, Inc. (SCI), respectively.  As a result of the acquisitions, the Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structures of Wild Flavors and SCI and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as the Company incorporates its controls and procedures into the acquired businesses.  Except for these acquisitions, there have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Archer-Daniels-Midland Companys (ADMs) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).ADMs internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, ADMs management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).  Based on this assessment, management concluded that ADMs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2014 .
Management's assessment of the effectiveness of ADM's internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Wild Flavors and SCI.  In accordance with the SEC guidance regarding the reporting of internal control over financial reporting in connection with an acquisition, management may omit an assessment of an acquired business' internal control over financial reporting from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition.  Management's assessment of the effectiveness of ADM's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 will include the internal controls of Wild Flavors and SCI.  Wild Flavors and SCI are included in ADM's consolidated financial statements and constituted 6.4% and 9.1% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2014, and 0.4% and 2.8% of revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended.
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 .That report is included herein.
