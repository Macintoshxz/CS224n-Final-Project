Business OVERVIEW CVS Corporation is a leader in the retail drugstore industry in the United States with net sales of $24.2 billion in 2002, making us the second largest retail drugstore chain based on sales. As of December 28, 2002, we operated 4,087 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia, making us the largest retail drugstore chain in the nation based on store count. We currently operate in 67 of the top 100 U.S. drugstore markets and hold the number one market share in 32 of these markets. Overall, we hold the number one or number two market share in 67% of the markets in which we operate. During 2002, we filled over 316 million prescriptions, or approximately 11% of the U.S. retail market. Our current operations are grouped into two businesses: Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM).
Retail Pharmacy ~ As of December 28, 2002, the Retail Pharmacy business included 4,054 retail drugstores, of which 3,957 operated a pharmacy, and the online retail website, CVS.com. The retail drugstores are located in 27 states and the District of Columbia, operating under the CVS or CVS/pharmacy name. CVS/pharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, greeting cards, film and photo finishing services, beauty products and cosmetics, seasonal merchandise and convenience foods, which we refer to as front store products. Existing stores generally range in size from approximately 8,000 to 12,000 square feet, although most new stores are based on either an approximately 10,000 or 12,000 square foot prototype building and typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. The Retail Pharmacy is our only reportable segment as it represented approximately 95% of consolidated net sales and operating profit in 2002.
Pharmacy Benefit Management ~ The PBM business provides a full range of prescription benefit management services to managed care and other organizations. These services include plan design and administration, formulary management, mail order pharmacy services, claims processing and generic substitution. The PBM business, which currently manages more than 14 million lives, operates under the PharmaCare Management Services name and ranks as one of the top ten full service PBMs in the nation. The PBM business also includes our Specialty Pharmacy operations, which represent the largest integrated retail and mail provider of specialty pharmacy services in the nation. Specialty pharmacy focuses on supporting individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies to treat conditions such as organ transplants, HIV/AIDS and genetic conditions such as infertility, multiple sclerosis and certain cancers. As of December 28, 2002, we operated 33 specialty pharmacies, located in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and two specialty mail order facilities. Specialty pharmacy stores, which operate under the CVS ProCare name, average 2,000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications, homeopathic remedies and vitamins.
On March 31, 1998, we completed a merger with Arbor Drugs, Inc., pursuant to which 37.8 million shares of CVS common stock were exchanged for all the outstanding common stock of Arbor. The aggregate value of this transaction, including the assumption of $17 million of existing Arbor debt, was $1.5 billion (based on stock market valuations at the time of the merger). The merger with Arbor made us the market share leader in metropolitan Detroit, the nations fourth largest retail drugstore market at the time, and strengthened our position as the nations top drugstore retailer in terms of store count and retail prescriptions dispensed.
CVS Corporation is a Delaware corporation. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, Rhode Island 02895, telephone (401) 765-1500. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol CVS. General information about CVS is available through our website at http://www.cvs.com. In addition, our financial press releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge on the investor relations portion of our website at http://investor.cvs.com.
2 RETAIL PHARMACY BUSINESS Operating Strategy ~ Our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use. We believe ease of use means convenience for the time-starved customer. As such, our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience (easy-to-access, clean, well-lit and well stocked). One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences is very important to our ability to maintain customer satisfaction.
Products ~ A typical CVS/pharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise. General merchandise categories include over-the-counter drugs, greeting cards, film and photo finishing services, beauty products and cosmetics, seasonal merchandise and convenience foods, which we refer to as front store products. We purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business. Consolidated net sales by major product group are as follows: Percentage   of Net Sales(1) 2002 2001 2000 Prescription   drugs 68 % 66 % 63 % Over-the-counter   and personal care 10 10 11 Beauty/cosmetics 6 7 7 General   merchandise and other 16 17 19 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Percentages are estimates based on store scanning data.
Pharmacy sales have been growing, and we believe will continue to grow, at a faster pace than front store sales. Pharmacy sales represented 67.6% of total sales in 2002, compared to 66.1% in 2001 and 62.7% in 2000. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers, favorable industry trends (an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness and the introduction and direct to consumer marketing of new drugs) and our on-going program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies. We believe our pharmacy success results from our investment in people and technology. Given the nature of prescriptions, people want their prescriptions filled fast by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology. Our continual investment in technology such as our Excellence in Pharmacy Innovation and Care (EPIC) system, our touch-tone telephone reorder system, Rapid Refill TM , and our online business, CVS.com, is driven by this belief.
Front store sales should continue to benefit from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences. A key component of this strategy is our ExtraCare card program, which is helping us to continue to build our loyal customer base. With 33 million members, ExtraCare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the United States. ExtraCare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks TM rewards and more. Another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings which include a full range of high-quality private label products that are only available through CVS. We currently carry over 1,500 CVS brand products, which accounted for approximately 12% of our front store sales during 2002. Due to the success of our private label program, we continue to assess opportunities to expand our range of private label product offerings such as our CVS Brand and Gold Emblem lines.
3 Store Development ~ The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a major role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient, freestanding sites. During 2002, we opened 174 new stores, relocated 92 stores and closed 278 stores of which 224 were as a result of the strategic restructuring announced in 2001. Our new store development during 2002 included 78 stores in new markets, including: Chicago, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; and several markets in Florida and Texas. During the last five years we opened more than 1,700 new and relocated stores. Approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years. During 2003, we expect to open approximately 150-175 new stores (including 80-100 in new markets), to relocate 100 stores and to close 50 stores. We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to competing effectively in the current managed care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry.
Information Systems ~ We have invested significantly in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency. We were one of the first in the industry to introduce Drug Utilization Review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies. We were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system, CVS Rapid Refill, which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touch-tone telephone. In 2001 we completed the rollout of EPIC, a multiyear project that reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions. The project included integrated workflow improvements, proprietary systems technology and automated pill-counting machines in high volume stores. We expect EPIC will continue to improve quality assurance and customer service, while reducing labor costs. In 2002, we completed the rollout of our Assisted Inventory Management (AIM) system for non-promotional front store merchandise. This system will more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces out-of-stock positions and lowers our investment in inventory. We also have several supply chain initiatives under way, including the expansion of our AIM system to include promotional merchandise.
Customers ~ During 2002, we served an average of 2.5 million customers per day. Since our sales are to numerous customers, including managed care organizations, the loss of any one customer would not have a material effect on the business. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of our total sales.
We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid plans. Total sales from all such plans were approximately 8% of consolidated net sales, or 12% of total pharmacy sales, during 2002.
Seasonality ~ The majority of our sales, particularly pharmacy sales, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, front store sales tend to be higher during the December holiday season. For additional information we refer you to the Note Quarterly Financial Information on page 39 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002.
Working Capital Practices ~ We fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations, commercial paper and long-term borrowings. For additional information on our working capital practices, we refer you to the caption Liquidity & Capital Resources on pages 16 and 17 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002, which is incorporated by reference herein. Due to the nature of the retail drugstore business, the majority of our non-pharmacy sales are in cash, while third party insurance programs, which typically settle in less than 30 days, represented 92.3% of our pharmacy sales in 2002. Our customer returns are not significant.
Associate Development ~ As of December 28, 2002, we employed approximately 105,000 associates, about 51,000 of whom are part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers and partners, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores and throughout our organization.
4 Intellectual Property and Licenses ~ We have registered or applied for registration of a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks and business licenses for use in our business. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of the Company and our stores. We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property. Our pharmacies and pharmacists must be licensed by the appropriate state boards of pharmacy. Our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Because of these licensing and registration requirements, we must comply with various statutes, rules and regulations, a violation of which could result in a suspension or revocation of these licenses or registrations.
Competition ~ The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety and (iv) price. In each of the markets we serve, we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers, discount merchandisers, membership clubs and internet pharmacies.
Item 2.
Properties We lease most of our stores under long-term leases that vary as to rental amounts, expiration dates, renewal options and other rental provisions. For additional information on the amount of our rental obligations for our leases, we refer you to the Note Leases on page 30 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002.
As of December 28, 2002, we owned approximately 2% of our 4,087 retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores. Net selling space for our retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores remained unchanged from prior year, at 31.5 million square feet as of December 28, 2002. Approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years.
We own four distribution centers located in Alabama, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee and lease five additional facilities located in, Indiana, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The nine distribution centers total approximately 5,000,000 square feet as of December 28, 2002. A new distribution center is under construction in Texas, which is currently projected to open during 2004.
We own our corporate headquarters building located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which contains approximately 568,000 square feet. We lease approximately 110,000 square feet of additional office space in Rhode Island. We also lease approximately 120,000 square feet in two mail order service facilities located in Fairfield, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, we continue to guarantee lease obligations for approximately 875 former stores. We are indemnified for these guarantee obligations by the respective purchasers. These guarantees generally remain in effect for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. For additional information, we refer you to the Note Commitments & Contingencies on page 35 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002.
Management believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the Companys anticipated needs. At the end of the existing lease terms, management believes the leases can be renewed or replaced by alternate space.

Legal Proceedings Beginning in August 2001, a total of nine actions were filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The actions were subsequently consolidated under the caption In re CVS Corporation Securities Litigation , No. 01-CV-11464 (D.Mass.) and a consolidated and amended complaint was filed on April 8, 2002. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the Company, its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer and asserts claims for alleged securities fraud under sections 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased shares of the Companys common stock between February 6, 2001 and October 30, 2001. On June 7, 2002, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. This motion was subsequently denied by the court on December 18, 2002. The Company believes the consolidated action is entirely without merit and intends to defend against it vigorously.
The Company is also a party to other litigation arising in the normal course of its business, none of which is expected to be material to the Company.
