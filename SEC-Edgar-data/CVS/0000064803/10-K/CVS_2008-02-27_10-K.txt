Business Overview CVS Caremark Corporation (CVS Caremark, the Company, we or us) is the largest provider of prescriptions and related healthcare services in the United States. We fill or manage more than one billion prescriptions annually. As a fully integrated pharmacy services company, we drive value for our customers by effectively managing pharmaceutical costs and improving healthcare outcomes through our approximately 6,200 CVS/pharmacy  retail stores; our pharmacy benefit management, mail order and specialty pharmacy division, Caremark Pharmacy Services; our retail-based health clinic subsidiary, MinuteClinic  ; and our online pharmacy, CVS.com  . We currently operate two business segments: Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services. Our business segments are operating units that offer different products and services and require distinct technology and marketing strategies.
The Caremark Merger Effective March22, 2007, we closed our merger with Caremark Rx, Inc. (Caremark). Following the Caremark Merger, we changed our name to CVS Caremark Corporation.
We believe CVS and Caremark are complementary companies and the merger is expected to yield benefits for health plan sponsors through more effective cost-management solutions and innovative programs and for consumers through expanded choice, improved access and more personalized services. We also believe we can operate the combined companies more efficiently than either company could have operated on its own. In that regard, the merger has enabled us to achieve significant synergies from purchasing scale and operating efficiencies. Purchasing synergies are largely comprised of purchase discounts and/or rebates obtained from generic and brand name drug manufacturers and cost efficiencies obtained from our retail pharmacy networks. Operating synergies include decreases in overhead expense, increases in productivity and efficiencies obtained by eliminating excess capacity, decreases in prescription dispensing costs and other benefits made possible by combining complementary operations.
Over the longer term, we expect the Caremark Merger will also create significant incremental revenue opportunities. These opportunities are expected to be derived from a variety of new programs and benefit designs that leverage our client relationships, our integrated information systems and the personal interaction of our more than 20,000 pharmacists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants with the millions of consumers who shop our stores on a daily basis. Examples of these programs include new prescription compliance and persistency programs, enhanced disease management programs, new ExtraCare card programs for plan beneficiaries, increased use of MinuteClinics by plan beneficiaries and flexible fulfillment options that afford plan beneficiaries the opportunity to pick-up maintenance medications in-store. While certain of these programs will commence in 2008, many are in their formative stage and require significant information system enhancements as well as changes in work processes. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the timing of the implementation of, or the amount of incremental revenues associated with, these kinds of programs.
Retail Pharmacy Segment As of December29, 2007, the Retail Pharmacy Segment included 6,245 retail drugstores, of which 6,164 operated a pharmacy, our online retail website, CVS.com  and our retail healthcare clinics. The retail drugstores are located in 40 states and the District of Columbia operating under the CVS  or CVS/pharmacy  names. We currently operate in 77 of the top 100 U.S. drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 58 of these markets. Overall, we hold the number one or number two market share position in 75% of the markets in which our retail drugstores operate. CVS/pharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods, which we refer to as front store products. Existing stores generally range in size from approximately 8,000 to 18,000 square feet, although most new stores range in size from approximately 10,000 to 13,000 square feet and typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. During fiscal 2007, we filled approximately 528million retail prescriptions, or approximately 17% of the U.S. retail pharmacy market.
3 Table of Contents As of December29, 2007, we operated 462 retail healthcare clinics in 25 states under the MinuteClinic  name, of which 437 are located within CVS retail drugstores. The clinics utilize nationally recognized medical protocols to diagnose and treat minor health conditions and are staffed by board-certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants.
Our Strategy ~ Our goal is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use. We believe that ease of use means convenience for the time-starved customer. As such, our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience (easy-to-access, clean, well-lit and well stocked). One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers needs and preferences is very important to our ability to continue to improve customer satisfaction.
Our Products ~ A typical CVS/pharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise. Front store categories include over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, film and photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods. We purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business. Consolidated net revenues by major product group are as follows: PercentageofNetRevenues (1) 2007 2006 2005 Prescription drugs 68 % 68 % 69 % Over-the-counter and personal care 13 13 10 Beauty/cosmetics 4 4 6 General merchandise and other 15 15 15 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Percentages are estimates based on store point-of-sale data.
Pharmacy ~ Pharmacy revenues represented 67.8% of Retail Pharmacy revenues in 2007, compared to 68.4% in 2006, and 68.6% in 2005. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers, favorable industry trends (e.g., an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness) the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products, a new federally funded prescription drug benefit, which was promulgated on January1, 2006 as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and our on going program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies. We believe our pharmacy business benefits from our investment in both people and technology. Given the nature of prescriptions, people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised, by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology. As such, our Pharmacy Service Initiative, which is designed to resolve potential problems at the point of drop-off that could delay a prescription being filled, has enabled us to improve our dispensing process resulting in improved customer service ratings. Further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continuing investment in technology, such as our Drug Utilization Review system that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies; our Rx Connect system; our touch-tone telephone reorder system, Rapid Refill TM ; and our online business, CVS.com.
Front Store ~ Front store revenues benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match our customers needs and preferences. For example, we were the first retail pharmacy to market with a digital photo solution throughout our chain, including being the first to offer printing from digital camera phones, the ability to upload digital photos to CVS.com and have them available for in store pickup the following day, and the first to offer a one-time-use digital camera. A key component of our front store strategy is our ExtraCare  card program, which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base. In addition, ExtraCare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the United States. ExtraCare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks TM rewards and other benefits. Another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings, which include a full range of high-quality CVS brand products that are only available through CVS. We currently carry over 2,100 CVS brand and proprietary brand products, which accounted for approximately 14% of our front store revenues during 2007.
4 Table of Contents Store Development ~ The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a major role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient, freestanding sites. During 2007, we opened 139 new stores, relocated 136 stores and closed 44 stores. During the last five years, we opened more than 1,300 new and relocated stores, and acquired more than 1,960 stores. Approximately two thirds of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years. During 2008, we expect to open between 300 and 325 new or relocated stores. We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to compete effectively in the current managed care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry.
Information Systems ~ We have continued to invest in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency. We were one of the first in the industry to introduce Drug Utilization Review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies. We were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system, CVS Rapid Refill TM , which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touch-tone telephone. In addition, we have installed Rx Connect, which reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions. Further, we have implemented our Assisted Inventory Management system, which is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces out-of-stock positions and lowers our investment in inventory. Most recently we rolled-out Visible Improvement in Profits, Execution and Results, a transaction monitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visibility to all transactions processed through our point-of-sale systems. In addition, we operate distribution centers with fully integrated technology solutions for storage, product retrieval and order picking.
Customers ~ Managed care and other third party plans accounted for 95% of our 2007 pharmacy revenues. Since our revenues relate to numerous payors, including employers and managed care organizations, the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on our business. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of our total revenues. We also fill prescriptions for many government funded programs, including State Medicaid plans and Medicare Part D drug plans.
Seasonality ~ The majority of our revenues, particularly pharmacy revenues, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, front store revenues tend to be higher during the December holiday season. For additional information, we refer you to the Note Quarterly Financial Information on page 68 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December29, 2007.
Competition ~ The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i)store location and convenience, (ii)customer service and satisfaction, (iii)product selection and variety and (iv)price. In each of the markets we serve, we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers, discount merchandisers, membership clubs, health clinics and Internet pharmacies.
5 Table of Contents Pharmacy Services Segment The Pharmacy Services business provides a full range of prescription benefit management (PBM) services including mail order pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy services, plan design and administration, formulary management and claims processing. Our customers are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. In addition, through our SilverScript Insurance Company (SilverScript) subsidiary, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the Federal Governments Medicare Part D program. Our specialty pharmacies support individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies. Our pharmacy services business operates a national retail pharmacy network with over 60,000 participating pharmacies (including CVS/pharmacy stores). We also provide health management programs, which include integrated disease management for 27 conditions through our Accordant  health management offering. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (the NCQA). Currently, the pharmacy services business operates under the Caremark Pharmacy Services  , PharmaCare Management Services  and PharmaCare Pharmacy  names. As of December29, 2007, the Pharmacy Services segment operated 56 retail specialty pharmacy stores, 20 specialty mail order pharmacies and 9 mail service pharmacies located in 26 states and the District of Columbia. Specialty pharmacy stores average 2,000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications, homeopathic remedies and vitamins.
Our Strategy ~ Our business strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality customer service in order to enhance clinical outcomes for the participants in our customers health benefit plans while assisting our customers in better managing their overall healthcare costs. We believe that our focus on management of our customers overall healthcare costs, our mail service, specialty pharmaceutical and health management expertise and the breadth and quality of our product and service offerings (which are expected to be significantly enhanced as a result of the Caremark Merger) distinguish us from many of our competitors.
Our Services ~ The PBM services we provide for our customers involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the cost and improving the safety, effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use.
Plan Design and Administration ~ Our customers sponsor pharmacy benefit plans which facilitate the ability of eligible participants in these plans to receive medications prescribed by their physicians. We assist our customers in designing pharmacy benefit plans that minimize the costs to the customer while prioritizing the welfare and safety of the customers participants. We also administer these benefit plans for our customers and assist them in monitoring the effectiveness of these plans through frequent, informal communications as well as through a formal annual customer review.
We make recommendations to our customers encouraging them to design benefit plans promoting the use of the lowest cost, most clinically appropriate drug, including generics when available. We believe that we help our customers control costs by recommending plans that encourage the use of generic equivalents of brand name drugs when such equivalents are available. Our customers also have the option, through plan design, to further lower their pharmacy benefit plan costs by setting different participant payment levels for different products on our drug lists.
Formulary Development ~ We utilize an independent panel of doctors, pharmacists and other medical experts, referred to as our Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, to select drugs that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy for inclusion on our drug lists. Our drug lists provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to ensure participant access to clinically appropriate alternatives under the customers pharmacy benefit plan. To improve clinical outcomes for participants and customers, we conduct ongoing, independent reviews of all drugs, including, but not limited to, those appearing on the drug list and generic equivalent products, as well as of our clinical programs.
6 Table of Contents Discounted Drug Purchase Arrangements ~ We negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on our drug lists, and the customers that choose to adopt our drug lists receive reduced costs from these negotiated discounts. The discounted drug purchase arrangements we negotiate typically provide for our receiving discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms. These discounts may take the form of a direct discount at the time of purchase, a discount for prompt payment of invoices or, when products are indirectly purchased from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy/chain), a retroactive discount, or rebate. We also receive additional discounts under our wholesale contracts if we exceed contractually-defined annual purchase volumes. We record these discounts, regardless of their form, as a reduction of our cost of revenues.
Prescription Management Systems ~ We dispense prescription drugs both directly, through our own pharmacies, and indirectly, through a network of third party retail pharmacies. All prescriptions, whether they are filled through one of our mail service pharmacies or through a pharmacy in our retail network, are analyzed, processed and documented by our proprietary prescription management systems. These systems assist staff and network pharmacists in processing prescriptions by automating tests for various items, including, but not limited to, plan eligibility, early refills, duplicate dispensing, appropriateness of dosage, drug interactions or allergies, over-utilization and potential fraud.
Mail Pharmacy Program ~ We currently operate 9 large, automated mail service pharmacies in the continental United States. Our customers or their physicians submit prescriptions, primarily for maintenance medications, to these pharmacies via mail, telephone, fax or the Internet. We also operate a network of 20 smaller mail service specialty pharmacies located throughout the United States and used for delivery of advanced medications to individuals with chronic or genetic diseases and disorders. Substantially all of the mail service specialty pharmacies have been accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). Additionally, we operate a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription amounts dispensed from our automated mail service pharmacies. Our staff pharmacists review mail service prescriptions and refill requests with the assistance of our prescription management systems. This review may involve communications with the prescribing physician and, with the physicians approval, can result in generic substitution, therapeutic interchange or other actions to affect cost or to improve quality of treatment. In these cases, we inform participants about the changes made to their prescriptions.
CareCenter  Pharmacies ~ We also operate a limited number of CareCenter pharmacies located at client sites, which provide participants with a convenient alternative for filling their prescriptions.
Retail Pharmacy Program ~ Our retail pharmacy program typically allows customers to fill prescriptions at more than 60,000 pharmacies nationwide (including CVS/pharmacy stores). When a customer fills a prescription in a retail pharmacy, the network pharmacist sends prescription data electronically to us from the point-of-sale. This data interfaces with our proprietary prescription management systems, which verify relevant customer data, including eligibility and participant information, perform drug utilization review to determine clinical appropriateness and safety and confirm that the pharmacy will receive payment for the prescription.
Quality Assurance ~ We have adopted and implemented clinical quality assurance procedures as well as policies and procedures to help ensure regulatory compliance under our quality assurance programs. Each new mail service prescription undergoes a sequence of safety and accuracy checks and is reviewed and verified by a registered pharmacist before shipment. We also analyze drug-related outcomes to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care.
Health Management Programs ~ Our clinical services utilize advanced protocols and offer customers convenience in working with healthcare providers and other third parties. Our AccordantCare  health management programs include integrated disease management, which includes over 20 diseases such as asthma, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hemophilia, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The majority of these integrated programs are accredited by the NCQA.
7 Table of Contents Information Systems ~ We currently operate primary information systems platforms to support our PBM services, which are supplemented by additional information systems to support our pharmacy operations. These information systems incorporate integrated architecture that centralizes the data generated from filling mail service prescriptions, adjudicating retail pharmacy claims and fulfilling other customer service contracts.
Customers ~ Our customers are primarily sponsors of health benefit plans (employers, unions, government employee groups, insurance companies and managed care organizations) and individuals located throughout the United States. We dispense pharmaceuticals to eligible participants in benefit plans maintained by our customers and utilize our information systems to perform safety checks, drug interaction screening and generic substitution. In addition, we are a national provider of drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal governments Medicare Part D program. We generate substantially all of our net revenue from dispensing prescription drugs to eligible participants in benefit plans maintained by our customers. During the year ended December29, 2007, we managed over 490million prescriptions for individuals from over 4,000 organizations, and our largest customer, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, accounted for approximately 7% of our Pharmacy Services segment net revenue.
In 2005, we were approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to participate in the drug benefit added to the Medicare program through Part D (Medicare Drug Benefit) of the MMA. We participate in the administration of the Medicare Drug Benefit through the provision of PBM services to our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Caremark also participates (i)by offering Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits through its subsidiary, SilverScript, which has been approved by CMS as a prescription drug plan under Medicare Part D in all regions of the country, and (ii)by assisting employer, union and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under Medicare Part D by collecting and submitting eligibility and/or drug cost data to CMS in order for them to obtain the subsidy. In addition, PharmaCare, through a joint venture with Universal American Insurance Corp., also participates in the offering of Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits by affiliated entities of Universal American that have qualified as Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. In February 2008, the Company and Universal American agreed to dissolve this joint venture at the end of the 2008 plan year and to divide responsibility for providing Medicare Part D services to the affected Universal American plan members beginning with the 2009 plan year. The terms of this agreement are subject to regulatory approval.
Competition ~ We believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include: (i)the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers; (ii)the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (iii)responsiveness to customers needs; (iv)the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies; (v)the ability to develop and utilize preferred drug lists; (vi)the ability to market PBM products and services; (vii)the commitment to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to customers; and (viii)the quality, scope and costs of products and services offered to customers and their participants. The Pharmacy Services segment competes with a number of large, national PBM companies, including Medco Health Solutions, Inc. and Express Scripts, Inc. as well as many smaller local or regional PBMs. We also compete with several large health insurers/managed care plans (e.g. Wellpoint, Aetna, CIGNA) and retail pharmacies, which have their own PBM capabilities, as well as with several other national and regional companies which provide services similar to ours.
8 Table of Contents Working Capital Practices We fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations, sale-leaseback transactions, commercial paper and long-term borrowings. For additional information on our working capital practices, we refer you to the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 28 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December29, 2007, which is incorporated by reference herein. The majority of our non-pharmacy revenues are in cash, while managed care and other third party insurance programs, which typically settle in less than 30 days, represented approximately 98% of our pharmacy revenues in 2007. Our customer returns are not significant.
Associate Development As of December29, 2007, we employed approximately 200,000 associates, which included more than 20,000 pharmacists and more than 1,000 nurse practitioners and physician assistants. In addition, approximately 80,000 were part-time employees who work less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores, clinics and throughout our organization.
Intellectual Property We have registered or applied to register a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks and business licenses for use in our business. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value in both our segments. We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property.
Government Regulation of Healthcare Matters Overview ~ As a participant in the healthcare industry, our retail and pharmacy services businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern the purchase, sale and distribution of prescription drugs and related services, including administration and management of prescription drug benefits. Many of our PBM clients, including insurers and managed care organizations (MCOs), are themselves subject to extensive regulations that affect the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans that they sponsor. The application of complex standards to the detailed operation of our business creates areas of uncertainty. Moreover, regulation of the healthcare industry continues to evolve, and there are numerous proposed healthcare laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, many of which could adversely affect our business if they are enacted. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on us. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or any adverse applications of, or changes in, the laws and regulations affecting our business, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Among the existing federal and state laws and regulations that affect aspects of our business are the following: Anti-Remuneration Laws ~ Federal law prohibits, among other things, an entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors, any remuneration to induce the referral of individuals or the purchase, lease or order (or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase, lease or order) of items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs. A number of states have similar laws, some of which are not limited to services for which government-funded payment may be made. State laws and exceptions or safe harbors vary and have been infrequently interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies. Sanctions for violating these federal and state anti-remuneration laws may include imprisonment, criminal and civil fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs. The federal anti-remuneration law has been interpreted broadly by some courts, the Office of Inspector General (the OIG) within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and administrative bodies. Because of the federal statutes broad scope, HHS established certain safe harbor regulations that specify various practices that are protected from criminal or civil liability. Safe harbors exist for certain discounts offered to purchasers, certain personal services arrangements, certain payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations, in certain cases the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians, and certain other 9 Table of Contents transactions and relationships. A practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful but may be subject to challenge by HHS.
In April 2003, the OIG issued a Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (the OIG Guidance). In the OIG Guidance, the OIG identifies potential risk areas for pharmaceutical manufacturers and also discusses a number of traditional relationships between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs, such as discount payments, service offerings and data sales, and recommends that such relationships be structured wherever possible to fit within an applicable safe harbor.
The federal anti-remuneration law has been cited as a partial basis, along with state consumer protection laws, for investigations and multi-state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs. Additionally, certain governmental entities have commenced investigations of companies in the pharmaceutical services industry and have identified issues concerning development of preferred drug lists, therapeutic substitution programs, pricing of pharmaceutical products and discounts from prescription drug manufacturers.
Antitrust ~ Numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the United States under various state and federal antitrust laws by retail pharmacies against drug manufacturers challenging certain brand drug pricing practices. These suits allege, in part, that the pharmaceutical manufacturers offered, and we and certain other PBMs knowingly accepted, rebates and discounts on purchases of brand-name prescription drugs in violation of the federal Robinson-Patman Act and the federal Sherman Act. The Robinson-Patman Act generally prohibits discriminatory pricing practices. The Sherman Act generally prohibits contracts and combinations that unreasonably restrain trade or facilitate monopolization of any part of interstate commerce. An adverse outcome in any of these lawsuits could require defendant drug manufacturers to provide the same types of discounts on pharmaceuticals to retail pharmacies and buying groups as are provided to PBMs and managed care entities, to the extent that their respective abilities to influence market share are comparable. This practice, if generally followed in the industry, could impact the purchase discounts we negotiate for our business.
In addition, several lawsuits have been filed against us and some of our PBM competitors by certain retail pharmacies and pharmacy-supported interest groups alleging that PBM practices relating to maintaining retail pharmacy networks constitute antitrust violations under the Sherman Act. To the extent that we appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market, our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties. See Item3, Legal Proceedings for further information.
Comprehensive PBM Regulation ~ Legislation seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner has been introduced or enacted in a number of states. This legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that: (i)impose certain fiduciary duties upon PBMs to customers and plan participants; (ii)require PBMs to remit to customers or their plan participants certain rebates, discounts and other amounts received by PBMs related to the sale of drugs; (iii)regulate product substitution and intervention; and/or (iv)impose broad disclosure obligations upon PBMs to customers and their plan participants. To the extent states or other government entities enact legislation regulating PBMs that survive legal challenges to their enforceability, such legislation could adversely impact our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms in locations where the legislation is in effect.
In addition, certain quasi-regulatory organizations, including the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) have issued model regulations or may propose future regulations concerning PBMs and/or PBM activities, and NCQA, the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) or other credentialing organizations may provide voluntary standards regarding PBM activities. In 2007, for example, URAC finalized PBM accreditation standards for PBMs serving the commercially insured market, and Caremark has been accredited as a PBM by URAC. URAC has stated that it also intends to develop standards for the Medicare and health plan markets. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory organizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence customer requirements for PBM services. Moreover, any standards established by these organizations could also impact our health plan customers and/or the services we provide to them.
10 Table of Contents In addition to state statutes and regulations, we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to PBMs through judicial interpretation or otherwise. Potential common law claims could involve, for example, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, fraud or unjust enrichment. The application of these common laws to PBMs and/or PBM activities could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms.
Consumer Protection Laws ~ The federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations, lawsuits and multi-state settlements relating to, among other matters, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic substitution programs. See Item3, Legal Proceedings for further information concerning a multi-state consumer protection settlement affecting Caremark.
Corporate Integrity Agreement ~ In September 2005, Caremarks subsidiary, AdvancePCS (now known as CaremarkPCS, L.L.C.), entered into a settlement agreement with the federal government relating to certain alleged PBM business practices, pursuant to which AdvancePCS agreed, among other things, to adhere to certain business practices pursuant to a consent order and to maintain a compliance program in accordance with a corporate integrity agreement for a period of five years. Our PBM subsidiaries have agreed, with limited exceptions, to comply with the requirements of the corporate integrity agreement applicable to AdvancePCS.
The corporate integrity agreement requires that we maintain our current compliance program; complete additional training requirements; report and return any overpayments received from federal health care programs; notify the OIG of any new investigations or legal proceedings initiated by a governmental entity involving an allegation of fraud or criminal conduct against us; engage an independent review organization to perform limited annual audits; and submit regular compliance reports to the OIG. Failure to meet our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could result in stipulated financial penalties. In addition, failure to comply with material terms could lead to exclusion of our PBM business from participation in federal health care programs.
Customer Audit ~ We are subject to customer audits of our PBM services pursuant to certain provisions in our customer contracts that grant audit rights. These contract provisions are customary in our PBM contracts, and the audits are typically conducted by or on behalf of our customers. Because some of our customer contracts are with state or federal governments, audits of these agreements are often regulated by the federal or state agencies responsible for administering federal or state benefits programs maintained by our customers, including those which operate prescription drug plans or Medicare Advantage organizations under the MMA. The audits generally focus on, among other things, compliance with the applicable terms of our customer contract and applicable legal requirements.
ERISA Regulation ~ The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), provides for comprehensive federal regulation of certain employee pension and health benefit plans, including self-funded corporate health plans and certain other plans that contract with us to provide PBM services. In general, we assist plan sponsors in the administration of the prescription drug portion of their health benefit plans, in accordance with the plan designs adopted by the plan sponsors. We do not believe that the conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, except when we have specifically contracted with a plan sponsor to accept limited fiduciary responsibility for the adjudication of initial prescription drug benefit claims and/or the appeals of denied claims under a plan. We and other PBMs have been named in lawsuits alleging that we act as a fiduciary, as such term is defined by ERISA, with respect to health benefit plans and that we have breached certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA. See Item3, Legal Proceedings for further information.
In addition to its fiduciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to covered health plans and certain other persons, if certain forms or excessive amounts of remuneration are paid or received. These provisions of ERISA are similar, but not identical, to the healthcare anti-remuneration statutes discussed elsewhere in this Government Regulation section, and they do not contain the statutory and regulatory safe harbor exceptions included in other healthcare statutes. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written, and we cannot be certain of the extent to which they could be deemed applicable to the conduct of our business.
11 Table of Contents The Department of Labor has recently published proposed regulations that could potentially create disclosure requirements for service providers to ERISA plans regarding direct and indirect compensation and potential conflicts of interest. The proposed regulations are broadly written and are subject to public comment. We cannot be certain of the content of these regulations if and when they are finalized or the extent to which they could be deemed applicable to our business.
State laws discussed in this Government Regulation section that may be applicable to us or to plan sponsors that are our customers may be preempted in whole or in part by ERISA. However, the scope of ERISA preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings.
False Claims and Fraudulent Billing Statutes ~ A range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities. One of the most significant of these laws is the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from a government-sponsored program. Some states have passed substantially similar acts. In recent years, federal and state governments have launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws. The Federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), for example, requires certain entities that receive or make annual Medicaid payments over a certain amount to provide their employees and certain contractors and agents with certain information regarding the federal and state false claims acts, whistleblower protections, and the entitys processes for detecting and preventing fraud, waste and abuse. Claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or whistleblower action, as discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Government Regulation section.
In addition, federal and state governments have commenced numerous investigations of various pharmaceutical manufacturers, PBMs, pharmacies and healthcare providers in recent years with respect to false claims, fraudulent billing and related matters. The federal government has entered into settlement agreements with several companies in the pharmaceutical services industry following claims by the federal government that such parties violated the Federal False Claims Act by: (i)improperly marketing and pricing drugs; (ii)overstating the average wholesale prices of products; (iii)paying illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of drugs; and/or (iv)failing to accurately report best price under the Medicaid program.
FDA Regulation ~ The FDA generally has authority to regulate drug promotional information and materials that are disseminated by a drug manufacturer or by other persons on behalf of a drug manufacturer. We operate a FDA-regulated repackaging facility in which we repackage certain drugs into the most common prescription quantities dispensed from our mail service pharmacies. The FDA also may inspect facilities in connection with procedures implemented to effect recalls of prescription drugs.
Formulary Regulation ~ A number of states have begun to regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits. For example, some states have passed laws mandating coverage for off-label uses of drug products where those uses are recognized in peer-reviewed medical journals or reference compendia. Other states have enacted laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers, MCOs and other third party payors. These laws have included requirements on the development, review and update of formularies, the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees, the disclosure of formulary information to health plan members, and a process for allowing members to obtain non-preferred drugs without additional cost-sharing when they are medically necessary and are determined to be clinically appropriate. Additionally, the NAIC has developed a model law, the Health Carriers Prescription Drug Benefit Management Model Act, that addresses formulary regulation issues for risk-bearing entities regulated by state insurance commissioners. The MMA also regulates how formularies are developed for, and administered to, beneficiaries of the Medicare Drug Benefit. To the extent that such legislation would be applicable to our business, increasing government regulation of formularies could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our insurer, MCO and other customers.
Health Management Services Regulation ~ We provide customers with clinical services in the form of health management programs, and we employ nurses and other clinicians, where needed, to develop and implement our health management programs. All states regulate the practice of medicine and the practice of nursing, and employees engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements.
12 Table of Contents Managed Care Reform ~ Proposed legislation has been considered on both the federal and state level, and legislation has been enacted in several states, aimed primarily at providing additional rights and access to drugs to individuals enrolled in managed care plans. This legislation may impact the design and implementation of prescription drug benefit plans sponsored by our PBM health plan customers and/or the services we provide to them. Some of these initiatives would, among other things: (i)require that health plan members have greater access to drugs not included on a plans formulary; (ii)give health plan members the right to sue their health plans for malpractice if they have been denied care; and/or (iii)mandate the content of the appeals or grievance process when a health plan member is denied coverage. Both the scope of the managed care reform proposals considered by Congress and state legislatures and reforms enacted by states to date vary greatly, and the scope of future legislation that may be enacted is uncertain.
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit ~ The MMA created the Medicare Drug Benefit starting in January 2006. Medicare beneficiaries entitled to Medicare benefits under Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B are eligible for the Medicare Drug Benefit under Medicare Part D. The MMA also created a subsidy available to certain employer, union and other group plans that provide retiree coverage to Part D eligible individuals that is at least equivalent to Part D coverage (the retiree drug subsidy). Regulations implementing the Medicare Drug Benefit were published beginning in January 2005 and include, without limitation, requirements relating to developing and administering formularies, establishing pharmacy networks, processing and adjudicating claims at point of sale and compliance with electronic prescribing standards. Government rules and regulations, which continue to evolve, impact the funding available for Medicare programs, PBM contracting arrangements with retail pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers or other parties related to the Medicare Drug Benefit and other terms and conditions affecting the Medicare Part D services we provide. For instance, the MMA-mandated risk corridor thresholds and the level of risk-sharing by the federal government will change in 2008, resulting in Part D sponsors, including SilverScript, assuming an increased level of drug cost risk. Therefore, to the extent that SilverScripts actual drug costs are higher or lower than estimated in its bids for 2008 and subsequent years, the federal government will share a smaller portion of the losses or gains, respectively. During 2007, CMS promulgated rules and regulations impacting calculation of the retiree drug subsidy of Part D sponsors. In addition, regulations have been issued or proposed that would impact, beginning in 2009, whether the differential between the drug price charged to Part D sponsors by a PBM and the drug price paid by the PBM to the dispensing pharmacy would constitute an administrative cost, rather than a drug cost, to the Part D sponsor for purposes of calculating reinsurance and risk corridor subsidy payments by the government.
Network Access Legislation ~ A majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting the ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Certain any willing provider legislation may require us or our customers to admit a non-participating pharmacy if such pharmacy is willing and able to meet the plans price and other applicable terms and conditions for network participation. These laws vary significantly from state to state in regard to scope, requirements and application. ERISA plans and payors have challenged the application of such laws on the basis of ERISA preemption. However, the scope of ERISA preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings. In addition, the MMA contains an any willing provider requirement for pharmacy participation in the Medicare Drug Benefit, and CMS has interpreted this as requiring that a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan must, for each type of pharmacy in its Part D network, allow participation by any pharmacy that meets the applicable terms and conditions for participation by that type of pharmacy that the plan has established. To the extent any state or federal any willing provider laws are determined to apply to us or to certain of our customers or to the pharmacy networks we manage for our PBM customers, such laws could negatively impact the services and economic benefits achievable through a limited pharmacy provider network.
Some states also have enacted due process legislation that may prohibit the removal of a provider from a pharmacy network except in compliance with certain procedures. Other state legislation prohibits days supply limitations or copayment differentials between mail service and retail pharmacy providers. In addition, under Medicare Part D, CMS requires that if a Part D sponsor offers a 90-day supply at mail, it must allow retail pharmacies to also offer a 90-day supply on the same terms.
Pharmacy Licensure and Regulation ~ We are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of retail and mail pharmacies, repackaging of drug products, wholesale distribution, dispensing of controlled substances and medical waste disposal. Federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances. Federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and our repackaging facility with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and to comply with security, recordkeeping, inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances.
13 Table of Contents We also are subject to certain federal and state laws affecting on-line pharmacies because we dispense prescription drugs pursuant to refill orders received through our Internet websites, among other methods. Several states have proposed new laws to regulate on-line pharmacies, and federal regulation of on-line pharmacies by the FDA or another federal agency has also been proposed.
Other statutes and regulations may affect our mail service operations. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising, to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold, to fill mail service orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate. In addition, the United States Postal Service has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail.
Our pharmacists are subject to state regulation of the profession of pharmacy and employees engaged in a professional practice must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements.
Plan Design Legislation ~ Some states have enacted legislation that prohibits a health plan sponsor from implementing certain restrictive design features, and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans, including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits. For example, some states have adopted freedom of choice legislation, which provides that: (i)members of a plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use non-network providers or (ii)a plan participant may sue his or her health plan if care is denied. Various states have enacted, or have considered enacting, legislation regarding plan design mandates, including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic substitution, requires coverage of all drugs approved by the FDA or prohibits denial of coverage for non-FDA approved uses. Some states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions. Such legislation does not generally apply to us, but it may apply to certain of our customers (generally, MCOs and health insurers). Other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans not covered by ERISA from requiring or offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies. Legislation imposing plan design mandates may apply to certain of our customers and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through PBM services we provide.
Privacy and Confidentiality Legislation ~ Many of our activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure by us of confidential health information, including disclosure of the confidential information to a participants health benefit plan, as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy laws. In addition, we use and disclose de-identified data for analytical and other purposes. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively HIPAA) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses (known as covered entities) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (PHI), including requirements to protect the integrity, availability and confidentiality of electronic PHI. HIPAA gives individuals the right to know how their PHI is used and disclosed, the right to access, amend and obtain information concerning certain disclosures of PHI. Covered entities, such as pharmacies and health plans, are required to provide a written Notice of Privacy Practices to individuals that describes how the entity uses and discloses PHI, and how individuals may exercise their rights with respect to their PHI. For most uses and disclosures of PHI other than for treatment, payment, healthcare operations or certain public policy purposes, HIPAA generally requires that covered entities obtain a valid written individual authorization. In most cases, use or disclosure of PHI must be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with HIPAA standards.
In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted health care information confidentiality laws, which limit the disclosure of confidential medical information. These state laws supersede HIPAA to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA.
In addition to establishing privacy and security standards for PHI, HIPAA established national standards for conducting certain healthcare transactions electronically (known as standard transactions), as well as national identifiers for employers and health care providers. The National Provider Identifier (NPI) Rule requires that all health care providers that conduct standard transactions apply for and obtain an NPI, and that all covered entities use this NPI in any standard transaction where that health care providers identifier is required. This Rule will have a significant operational 14 Table of Contents impact on our business in that all electronic pharmacy claims will have to reflect the pharmacys NPI and, to the extent the prescriber is a covered entity, the prescribers NPI, instead of current identifiers such as the National Council for Prescription Drug Program numbers. CMS has stated that it will not impose penalties on covered entities through May 2008 if they deploy contingency plans and have made reasonable and diligent efforts to become compliant with the Rule.
In response to concerns about identity theft, many states have passed security breach notification laws, including laws requiring notification to consumers of security breaches involving personal information. These laws generally require an entity conducting business in the state to notify consumers when their personal information has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. In some cases, the law applies only to unencrypted computerized information, but in others it applies to personal information in any form. In addition to requiring notification to the affected individuals without unreasonable delay, many state laws also require notification to government agencies, such as the state attorney general or consumer protection agencies.
Reimbursement ~ A portion of our net revenue is derived directly from Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs, and we are therefore subject to, among other laws and regulations, federal and state anti-remuneration laws, the Stark Law and/or federal and state false claims laws discussed elsewhere in this section. Sanctions for violating these federal and/or state laws may include, without limitation, criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Also, we provide products and services to managed care entities that provide services to beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs, as well as employers that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy.
The federal government and numerous state governments have given increased attention to how pharmaceutical manufacturers develop and report pricing information, which, in turn, is used in setting payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. One element common to most payment formulas, Average Wholesale Price (AWP), has come under criticism for allegedly inaccurately reflecting prices actually charged and paid at the wholesale level. The calculation and reporting of AWP have been the subject of investigations by federal and state governments and litigation brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers and data services that report AWP. We are not responsible for calculations, reports or payments of AWP; however such investigations or lawsuits could impact our business because many of our customer contracts, pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts and other agreements use AWP as a pricing benchmark. In October 2006, First DataBank (FDB), one of two primary sources of AWP price reporting, announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement relating to its AWP reporting, subject to final court approval. Under the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, FDB agreed to reduce the reported AWP of certain drugs by four percent and to discontinue the publishing of AWP at a future time. In May 2007, Medi-Span, the other primary source of AWP price reporting, entered into a similar settlement agreement, also subject to final court approval. In January 2008, the court denied approval of the FDB and Medi-Span settlements as proposed, and the outcome of the pending litigation remains uncertain.
Under the MMA, the Average Sales Price (ASP), has replaced AWP as the basis for reimbursing physicians, and sometimes pharmacies, for outpatient prescription drugs under Medicare Part B. For single source drugs, the payment will equal 106 percent of the lesser of: (i)the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of the product; or (ii)the ASP of the product. ASP is the weighted average of a manufacturers sales to all purchasers in a given quarter, after certain pricing adjustments such as discounts or rebates and excluding sales to certain government and other purchasers.
Further, the federal Medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state Medicaid programs. Manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of: (a)15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) paid by wholesalers for products distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade or (b)the difference between AMP and the best price available to essentially any customer other than the Medicaid program, with certain exceptions. Investigations have been commenced by certain governmental entities that question whether best price was properly calculated, reported and paid by the manufacturers to the Medicaid programs. We are not responsible for calculations, reports or payments of best price; however, these investigations could impact our ability to negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers.
During 2007, CMS issued a final rule implementing provisions under the DRA regarding prescription drugs under the Medicaid program. Among other things, the rule defines AMP and best price, and specifies the items that must be included and excluded in the calculation of each (AMP Rule). Under the AMP Rule, which became effective October1, 2007, sales to mail pharmacies would be included in the calculation of AMP, but rebates and other discounts 15 Table of Contents negotiated by PBMs in their capacity as PBMs would be excluded. The rule also implements the DRA provision establishing a new reimbursement formula for generic drugs under Medicaid and establishes federal upper limits (FULs) for generics based on 250 percent of the lowest AMP in a given drug class. Although the AMP Rule is final, CMS has asked for public comments on the AMP and FUL outlier provisions to assist it in fully considering the issues and developing policies, so changes to the AMP Rule or its interpretation could occur. In December 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia preliminarily enjoined CMS from implementing the AMP Rule to the extent such action affects Medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies and from posting online or disclosing any AMP data.
Certain state Medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state. While we believe that we can service our current Medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies, there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact in-state dispensing requirements for their Medicaid programs. Some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state Medicaid program give the state the best price that the pharmacy makes available to any third party payor. These requirements are sometimes referred to as most favored nation pricing payment systems. Other states have enacted unitary pricing legislation, which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives. A number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits, rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the states population.
Changes in reporting of AWP, or other adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of drug payments by Medicaid and Medicare, could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate discounts with manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs or retail pharmacies. In some circumstances, such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from Medicare or Medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from MCOs that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits.
Reimportation ~ The MMA amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by providing that the FDA should promulgate rules that would permit pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from Canada into the United States under certain circumstances. However, the promulgation of such rules is subject to a precondition that the FDA certify to Congress that such re-importation would not pose any additional risk to the publics health and safety and that it would result in a significant cost reduction. To date, the FDA has not provided such a certification. In the past, under certain defined circumstances, the FDA has used its discretion to permit individuals and their physicians to bring into the U.S. small quantities of drugs for treatment of a patients serious condition for which effective treatment is not available in the U.S. In September 2006, Congress expanded this personal use policy in very specific circumstances to allow individuals to personally transport from Canada for their personal use a 90-day supply of any prescription drug, regardless of availability in the U.S. The language does not allow purchases by mail order or via the Internet, and excludes biologics and controlled substances. The FDA continues to strongly oppose efforts to allow the widespread importation of drugs from Canada and elsewhere, citing concerns that such activities undermine the FDAs ability to oversee the quality and safety of the nations drug supply. If the FDA changes its position and permits the broader importation of drugs from Canada in the future or if new legislation or regulations permit the importation of drugs from the European Union or other countries in the future, our pharmacy services could be impacted.
Self-Referral Laws ~ The federal law commonly known as the Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for designated health services (which include, among other things, outpatient prescription drugs, home health services and durable medical equipment and supplies) to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship and prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to Medicare or Medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral. Possible penalties for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment, refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute, civil monetary penalties and Medicare and Medicaid program exclusion. The Stark Law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships, including certain physician consulting arrangements, fair market value purchases by physicians and the provision of electronic prescribing technology to physicians.
State statutes and regulations also prohibit payments for the referral of individuals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Some of these state statutes and regulations apply to services reimbursed by governmental as well as private payors. Violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of pharmacy or healthcare provider licenses, fines and criminal penalties. The laws 16 Table of Contents and exceptions or safe harbors may vary from the federal Stark Law and vary significantly from state to state. The laws are often vague, and, in many cases, have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies.
State Insurance Laws ~ Fee-for-service prescription drug plans and our PBM service contracts, including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guaranties or similar arrangements, are generally not subject to insurance regulation by the states. However, if a PBM offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits, laws and regulations in various states may be applicable. Such laws may require that the party at risk become licensed as an insurer, establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability. Laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing MCOs and limited prepaid health service plans.
Pursuant to the MMA, SilverScriptmust be licensed as a risk-bearing entity under state laws or have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from CMS.SilverScriptreceived a license in 2006 from the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insuranceto operate as ahealthinsurance company under the applicable laws and regulations of the State of Tennessee.SilverScriptalso has filed expansion applications for licensure as an insurance company in other jurisdictions where it may seek to do business, and to date SilverScript has received licenses to operate as an insurance company in41 other states and the District of Columbia and has maintained waivers of such licensing requirements in all remaining states in accordance with CMS requirements. As a licensed insurance company, SilverScript is subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require, among other things, maintenance of capital and surplus requirements, review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial and operational reports. If SilverScript is unable either to acquire all necessary insurance licenses or to maintain waivers of such licensing requirements, there may be a materially adverse impact on SilverScripts ability to participate in the Medicare Drug Benefit as a prescription drug plan.Pursuant to the MMA, state insurance licensing, insurance agent/broker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to prescription drug plans, but the application of other state laws to the Medicare Drug Benefit are generally preempted by Medicare Part D to the extent that Medicare Part D regulates the issue.
Some states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance company. These state laws vary, and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, several states have passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that requires, among other things, that health plans and payors pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties. These laws vary from state to state in regard to scope, requirements and application, and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our customers or to us. Certain health plans and payors may be exempt from such laws on the basis of ERISA preemption, but the scope of ERISA preemption is unclear.
State Prescription Drug Assistance Programs ~ Many states have established or modified their drug assistance programs for the elderly so that they constitute qualified state pharmacy assistance programs (SPAPs) that supplement the Medicare Drug Benefit. Payments by qualified SPAPs on behalf of a Medicare Part D enrollee are treated under Medicare Part D as if they were made by the enrollees themselves, thereby counting towards the enrollees true out-of-pocket costs and helping them qualify for catastrophic coverage sooner. Prescription drug plans under Medicare Part D are required to coordinate benefits with SPAPs, including allowing SPAPs to subsidize the Medicare Part D premiums of their members and/or their Medicare Part D cost sharing. Some qualified SPAPs have also received permission from CMS to auto-assign their enrollees that do not choose their own Medicare Part D plans into Medicare Part D plans. We have been and continue to be in active discussions with SPAPs to coordinate benefits with our Medicare Drug Benefit offerings and, where applicable, enrollment by SPAP members into our prescription drug plan under Medicare Part D.
Telemarketing ~ Certain federal and state laws give the FTC and state attorneys general law enforcement tools to regulate telemarketing practices. These laws may require disclosures of specific information, prohibit misrepresentations, limit when consumers may be called, require transmission of Caller ID information, prohibit certain abandoned outbound calls, prohibit unauthorized billing, set payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services and require the retention of specific business records.
Third Party Administration and Other State Licensure Laws ~ Many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of administrative organizations, such as preferred provider organizations, third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services. Several states also have licensure or registration laws governing the organizations that provide or administer consumer card programs (also known as cash card or discount card programs). The scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state, and the application of such laws to our activities often is unclear.
17 Table of Contents Whistleblower Statutes ~ Certain federal and state laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, contain provisions permitting the filing of qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits alleging violations of such laws. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government, and there is generally no minimum evidentiary or legal threshold required for bringing such a lawsuit. These lawsuits are typically filed under seal with the applicable federal or state enforcement authority, and such authority is required to review the allegations made and to determine whether it will intervene in the lawsuit and take the lead in the litigation. If the government intervenes in the lawsuit and prevails, the whistleblower plaintiff filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the lawsuit, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently. Because a qui tam lawsuit typically is filed under seal pending a government review of the allegations, the defendant generally may not be aware of the lawsuit until the government determines whether or not it will intervene or until the lawsuit is otherwise unsealed, a process which may take years. See Item3, Legal Proceedings, for further information.
We believe that we are in material compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our retail and PBM businesses. We have implemented standard operating procedures, internal controls and a compliance and integrity program designed to help ensure such compliance, and we monitor legislative and judicial developments that could impact our business practices in an effort to ensure future compliance.
We can give no assurance, however, that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected, or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices, based on: (i)future enactment of new healthcare or other laws or regulations; (ii)the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relate to our business or the retail or pharmacy services industry; (iii)pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services industry; (iv)institution of government enforcement actions against us; (v)adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against us, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against us; or (vi)adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services industry.

Inability to realize the cost savings and other benefits of the Caremark Merger.
We may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of the Caremark Merger. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the merger could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock.
Efforts to reduce reimbursement levels and alter healthcare financing practices could adversely affect our businesses.
The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, other PBM companies, government entities, and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability. In particular, increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs), has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to retail and mail order pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in the generic profit rate. In addition, during the past several years, the U.S. healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are underway at the federal and state government levels. Changing political, economic and regulatory influences may affect healthcare financing and reimbursement practices. If the current healthcare financing and reimbursement system changes significantly, the combined companys business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
On February8, 2006, the President signed into law the DRA. The DRA seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, retail pharmacies are expected to negotiate with individual states for higher dispensing fees to mitigate the adverse effect of these changes. These changes were expected to begin to take effect in 2007 and to result in reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies. During 2007, CMS issued a final rule implementing the new reimbursement formula. Subsequent to issuance of this rule, a group of retail pharmacy industry trade groups filed suit in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin CMS from implementing the rule. On December14, 2007, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia preliminarily enjoined CMS from implementing the final rule to the extent such action affects Medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies. As a result, implementation has been delayed indefinitely. Accordingly, the extent of any reductions and the impact on the Company cannot be determined at this time.
The possibility of customer loss and/or the failure to win new business may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Our PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related healthcare services to plan participants. PBM client contracts generally have terms approximating 3 years in duration.
19 Table of Contents Accordingly, approximately one third of a PBMs customer base typically is subject to renewal each year, and therefore we face challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business. Although none of our PBM clients are expected to represent more than 10% of our Companys consolidated revenues in 2008, our top 10 clients are expected to represent approximately 33.2% of such revenues in 2008. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to the Company as the present terms. Accordingly, our failure to renew or win PBM business could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Risks related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of new prescription drugs as well as generic alternatives to brand name prescription products.
The profitability of retail and mail order pharmacy businesses are dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. Utilization trends are affected by the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products. Accordingly, a slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals and/or generic alternatives (the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margins than brand name equivalents) could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Risks of declining gross margins in the PBM industry.
The PBM industry has been experiencing margin pressure as a result of competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices, enhanced service offerings and/or higher service levels. In that regard, our Company maintains contractual relationships with generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our national retail network (including CVS/pharmacy stores) and by our mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Manufacturer rebates often depend on a PBMs ability to meet contractual market share or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturers products on the PBMs formularies. Competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused Caremark and other PBMs to share with clients a larger portion of rebates and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or to formulary management or other PBM services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. Accordingly, margin pressure in the PBM industry resulting form these trends could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Uncertainty regarding the impact of Medicare Part D may adversely affect our business, financial position and our results of operations.
Since its inception in 2006, the Medicare Drug Benefit has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates as higher margin business, such as cash and state Medicaid customers, migrated to Medicare Part D coverage. Further, as a result of the Medicare Drug Benefit, our PBM clients could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. If this occurs, the adverse effects of the Medicare Drug Benefit may outweigh any opportunities for new business generated by the new benefit. Since the program continues to evolve, we are not yet able to assess the full impact that Medicare Part D will have on clients decisions to continue to offer a prescription drug benefit to their Medicare-eligible members. In addition, if the cost and complexity of the Medicare Drug Benefit exceed managements expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; if the government alters Medicare program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of the MMA or for other reasons; if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants; or if we are not successful in retaining enrollees, or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the MMAs competitive bidding process, our Medicare Part D services and the ability to expand our Medicare Part D services could be materially and adversely affected, and our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
Changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Contracts in the prescription drug industry, including Caremarks network contracts and its PBM and specialty client contracts, generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs. These benchmarks include AWP, ASP and WAC. Most of our PBM client contracts utilize the AWP standard. Further, most of the contracts governing the participation of CVS stores in retail pharmacy networks also utilize the AWP standard.
20 Table of Contents Recent events, including the FDB and Medi-Span litigation described in the Government Regulation of Healthcare Matters section, have raised uncertainties as to whether payors, pharmacy providers, PBMs and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize AWP as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry.
Changes in reporting of AWP, or in the basis for calculating reimbursement proposed by the federal government and certain states, and other legislative or regulatory adjustments that may be made regarding the reimbursement of payments for drugs by Medicaid and Medicare, could impact our pricing to customers and other payors and could impact our ability to negotiate discounts with manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs or retail pharmacies. In some circumstances, such changes could also impact the reimbursement that we receive from Medicare or Medicaid programs for drugs covered by such programs and from MCOs that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits. In addition, it is possible that payors, pharmacy providers and PBMs will begin to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and PBM services in the future, and the effect of this development on the business of the Company cannot be predicted at this time.
The industries in which we operate are extremely competitive and competition could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
Each of the retail pharmacy business and the PBM business currently operates in a highly competitive environment. As a pharmacy retailer, we compete with other drugstore chains, supermarkets, discount retailers, membership clubs, Internet companies and retail health clinics, as well as other mail order pharmacies and PBMs. In regard, many pharmacy benefit plans have implemented plan designs that mandate or provide incentives to fill maintenance medications through mail order pharmacies. To the extent this trend continues, our retail pharmacy business could be adversely affected (although the effect of this would likely be mitigated by an increase in our own mail order business). In addition, some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As a result, competition could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Competitors in the PBM industry include large national PBM companies, such as Medco Health Solutions, Inc. and Express Scripts, Inc., as well as many local or regional PBMs. In addition, there are several large health insurers and managed care plans (e.g., Wellpoint, Aetna, CIGNA, UnitedHealthcare) and retail pharmacies (e.g., Walgreens, Longs and Rite Aid) which have their own PBM capabilities as well as several other national and regional companies that provide some or all of the same services. Some of these competitors may offer services and pricing terms that we, even if the anticipated benefits of our merger are realized in full, may not be able to offer. In addition, competition may also come from other sources in the future. As a result, competition could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Existing and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
The PBM business and retail drugstore business are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. See Business  Government Regulation of Healthcare Matters. Changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of licensure. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation of Healthcare Matters section; accounting standards; tax laws and regulations; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be affected by one or more of the following:  federal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, management, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, whether at retail or mail, and applicable licensing requirements; 21 Table of Contents  the effect of the expiration of patents covering brand name drugs and the introduction of generic products;  the frequency and rate of approvals by the FDA of new brand named and generic drugs, or of over-the-counter status for brand name drugs;  FDA regulation affecting the retail or PBM industry;  rules and regulations issued pursuant to the HIPAA; and other federal and state laws affecting the use, disclosure and transmission of health information, such as state security breach laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information;  administration of the Medicare Drug Benefit, including legislative changes and/or CMS rulemaking and interpretation;  government regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists;  state laws and regulations establishing or changing prompt payment requirements for payments to retail pharmacies;  impact of network access (any willing provider) legislation on ability to manage pharmacy networks;  managed care reform and plan design legislation;  insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering a prescription drug plan in connection with the Medicare Drug Benefit; and  direct regulation of pharmacies or PBMs by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies.
Risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.
Pharmacy services and retail pharmacy are highly regulated and litigious industries. Our Company is currently subject to various litigation matters and legal proceedings. Resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As such we refer you to Item3. Legal Proceedings for additional information.
Efforts to reform the U.S. healthcare system may adversely affect our financial performance Congress periodically considers proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system. These proposals may increase government involvement in healthcare and regulation of PBM or pharmacy services, or otherwise change the way the combined company or its clients do business. Health plan sponsors may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by reducing or delaying purchases of cost control mechanisms and related services that the combined company would provide. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, these proposals may have on its retail and pharmacy services businesses. Other legislative or market-driven changes in the healthcare system that the Company cannot anticipate could also materially adversely affect the combined companys consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position and/or consolidated cash flow from operations.
The health of the economy in general and in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business and our financial results.
Our business is affected by the economy in general including changes in consumer purchasing power, preferences and/or spending patterns. Our ability to attract, hire and retain suitable pharmacists, management, nurse practitioners and physicians assistants as well as establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs is directly impacted by the economic environment. Further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms and/or our ability to secure suitable store locations under acceptable terms.
The foregoing is not a comprehensive listing and there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting the business. As such, we refer you to the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which includes our Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements at the end of such section, on pages 18 through 36 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December29, 2007, which is incorporated by reference.

Legal Proceedings 1.
In 2006, a number of shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the Tennessee state court and the Tennessee federal court against Caremark and various officers and directors of Caremark containing allegations relating to Caremarks stock option granting practices. The cases brought in the Tennessee federal court were consolidated into one action in August 2006, and the consolidated action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiffs in March 2007. The cases brought in the Tennessee state court were also consolidated into one action in September 2006, and the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add CVS and its directors as defendants and to allege class action claims. A stipulation of settlement was entered into by the parties in July2007, which provided, among other things, that (i)the plaintiffs will dismiss the case and release the defendants from claims asserted in the action, (ii)a temporary restraining order issued by the court in March 2007 will be vacated, (iii)the Company will agree to maintain for at least four years a number of corporate governance provisions relating to the granting, exercise and disclosure of stock option awards and (iv)the defendants will not oppose plaintiffs petition for an award of attorneys fees and expenses not to exceed $7.5 million. As part of the settlement, the defendants specifically denied any liability or wrongdoing with respect to all claims alleged in the litigation, including claims relating to stock option backdating, and stated that they entered into the settlement solely to avoid the distraction, burden and expense of the pending litigation. The settlement was orally approved by the court, but it remains subject to final court approval. The settlement is also subject to a pending application for extraordinary appeal filed by plaintiffs counsel relating to the courts prior rulings concerning the settlement and the award of attorneys fees and expenses.

Caremarks subsidiary Caremark Inc. (now known as Caremark, L.L.C.) is a defendant in a qui tam lawsuit initially filed by a relator on behalf of various state and federal government agencies in Texas federal court in 1999. The case was unsealed in May 2005. The case seeks money damages and alleges that Caremarks processing of Medicaid and certain other government claims on behalf of its clients violates applicable federal or state false claims acts and fraud statutes. The U.S. Department of Justice and the States of Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana and California intervened in the lawsuit, but Tennessee and Florida withdrew from the lawsuit in August 2006 and May 2007, respectively. A phased approach to discovery is ongoing. The parties have filed cross motions for partial summary judgment, argued those motions before the court and final rulings are pending.
In December 2007, the Company received a document subpoena from the Office of Inspector General within the United States Department of Health and Human Services requesting certain information relating to the processing of Medicaid claims and claims of certain other government programs on an adjudication platform of AdvancePCS (acquired by Caremark in March 2004 and now known as CaremarkPCS, L.L.C.). The Company will cooperate with these requests for information and cannot predict the timing, outcome, or consequence of the review of such information.
3.
Caremarks subsidiary Caremark Inc. (now known as Caremark, L.L.C.) has been named in a putative class action lawsuit filed in July 2004, in Tennessee federal court by an individual named Robert Moeckel, purportedly on behalf of the John Morrell Employee Benefits Plan, which is an employee benefit plan sponsored by a former Caremark client. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief, alleges that Caremark acts as a fiduciary under ERISA and has breached certain alleged fiduciary duties under ERISA. In November 2007, the court granted Caremark Inc.s motion forpartial summary judgment finding thatit is not an ERISA fiduciary under the applicable PBM agreements and that the plaintiffmay not sustain claims for breach of fiduciary duty.
4.
In 2004, Caremark received Civil Investigative Demands or similar requests for information relating to certain PBM business practices of its Caremark Inc. (now known as Caremark, L.L.C.) and AdvancePCS (now known as CaremarkPCS, L.L.C.) subsidiaries under state consumer protection statutes from 28 states plus the District of Columbia. On February14, 2008, Caremark entered into a settlement concluding this investigation. Caremark agreed to pay $12 million in settlement on behalf of AdvancePCS, $10 million in settlement on behalf of Caremark Inc., $16.5 million in state investigative costs and up to $2.5 million to reimburse certain medical tests. In addition, Caremark entered into a consent order requiring it to maintain certain PBM business practices. Caremark has expressly denied all wrongdoing and entered into the settlement to avoid the uncertainty and expense of the investigation.
25 Table of Contents 5.
Caremark was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed on October22, 2003 in Alabama state court by John Lauriello, purportedly on behalf of participants in the 1999 settlement of various securities class action and derivative lawsuits against Caremark and others. Other defendants include insurance companies that provided coverage to Caremark with respect to the settled lawsuits. The Lauriello lawsuit seeks approximately $3.2 billion in compensatory damages plus other non-specified damages based on allegations that the amount of insurance coverage available for the settled lawsuits was misrepresented and suppressed. A similar lawsuit was filed on November5, 2003, by Frank McArthur, also in Alabama state court, naming as defendants Caremark, several insurance companies, attorneys and law firms involved in the 1999 settlement. This lawsuit was subsequently stayed by the court as a later-filed class action.
In 2005, the trial court in the Lauriello case issued an order allowing the Lauriello case to proceed on behalf of the settlement class in the 1999 securities class action. McArthur then sought to intervene in the Lauriello case and to challenge the adequacy of Lauriello as class representative and his lawyers as class counsel. The trial court denied McArthurs motion to intervene, but the Alabama Supreme Court subsequently ordered the lower court to vacate its prior order on class certification and allow McArthur to intervene. Caremark and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint in intervention filed by McArthur. In November 2007, the trial court dismissed the attorneys and law firms named as defendants in the McArthur complaint in intervention and denied the motions to dismiss that complaint filed by Caremark and the insurance company defendants. In January 2008, Lauriello filed a motion to dismiss McArthurs complaint in intervention, appealed the courts dismissal of the attorney and law firm defendants and filed a motion to stay proceedings pending his appeal.
6.
Various lawsuits have been filed alleging that Caremark and its subsidiaries Caremark Inc. (now known as Caremark, L.L.C.) and AdvancePCS (now known as CaremarkPCS, L.L.C.) have violated applicable antitrust laws in establishing and maintaining retail pharmacy networks for client health plans. In August 2003, Bellevue Drug Co., Robert Schreiber, Inc. d/b/a Burns Pharmacy and Rehn-Huerbinger Drug Co. d/b/a Parkway Drugs #4, together with Pharmacy Freedom Fund and the National Community Pharmacists Association filed a putative class action against AdvancePCS in Pennsylvania federal court, seeking treble damages and injunctive relief. The claims were initially sent to arbitration based on contract terms between the pharmacies and AdvancePCS.
In October 2003, two independent pharmacies, North Jackson Pharmacy, Inc. and C&C, Inc. d/b/a Big C Discount Drugs, Inc. filed a putative class action complaint in Alabama federal court against Caremark, Caremark Inc., AdvancePCS (acquired by Caremark in March 2004 and now known as CaremarkPCS, L.L.C.) and two PBM competitors, seeking treble damages and injunctive relief. The case against Caremark and Caremark Inc. was transferred to Illinois federal court, and the AdvancePCS case was sent to arbitration based on contract terms between the pharmacies and AdvancePCS. The arbitration was then stayed by the parties pending developments in Caremarks court case.
In August 2006, the Bellevue case and the North Jackson Pharmacy case were transferred to Pennsylvania federal court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated and consolidated proceedings with other cases before the panel, including cases against other PBMs. Caremark has appealed a decision which vacated the order compelling arbitration and staying the proceedings in the Bellevue case to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Motions for class certification in the coordinated cases within the multidistrict litigation, including the North Jackson Pharmacy case, remain pending. The consolidated action is now known as the In Re Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litigation.
7.
Caremark and its subsidiaries Caremark Inc. (now known as Caremark, L.L.C.) and AdvancePCS (acquired by Caremark in March 2004 and now known as CaremarkPCS, L.L.C.) have been named in a putative class action lawsuit filed in California state court by an individual named Robert Irwin, purportedly on behalf of California members of non-ERISA health plans and/or all California taxpayers. The lawsuit, which also names other PBMs as defendants, alleges violations of Californias unfair competition laws and challenges alleged business practices of PBMs, including practices relating to pricing, rebates, formulary management, data utilization and accounting and administrative processes. Discovery in the case is ongoing.

The Rhode Island Attorney Generals Office, the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, and the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Rhode Island have been investigating the business relationships between certain former members of the Rhode Island General Assembly and various Rhode Island companies, including Roger Williams Medical Center, Blue Cross& Blue Shield of Rhode Island and CVS. In connection with the investigation of these business relationships, a former state senator was criminally charged in 2005 by federal and state authorities and has pled guilty to those charges, and a former state representative was criminally charged in October 2007 by federal authorities and has pled guilty to those charges. In January 2007, two CVS employees on administrative leave from the Company were indicted on federal charges relating to their involvement in entering into a $12,000 per year consulting agreement with the former state senator eight years ago. The indictment alleges that the two CVS employees concealed the true nature of the Companys relationship with the former state senator from other Company officials and others. CVS will continue to cooperate fully in this investigation, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.
9.
The Company has been named in a putative class action lawsuit filed in California state court by Gabe Tong, purportedly on behalf of current and former pharmacists working in the Companys California stores. The lawsuit alleges that CVS failed to provide pharmacists in the purported class with meal and rest periods or to pay overtime as required under California law. In October 2007, the Company reached a conditional agreement, which is subject to approval by the court to resolve this matter. In addition, the Company is party to other employment litigation arising in the normal course of its business. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any of these employment litigation matters at this time, but none of these matters are expected to be material to the Company.
10.
As previously disclosed, the United States Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are investigating whether any civil or criminal violations resulted from certain practices engaged in by CVS and others in the pharmacy industry with regard to dispensing one of two different dosage forms of a generic drug under circumstances in which some state Medicaid programs at various times reimbursed one dosage form at a different rate from the other. The Company is in discussions with various governmental agencies involved to resolve this matter on a civil basis and without any admission or finding of any violation.
11.
The Company is also a party to other litigation arising in the normal course of its business, none of which is expected to be material to the Company. The Company can give no assurance, however, that our operating results and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, or that we will not be required to materially change our business practices, based on: (i)future enactment of new healthcare or other laws or regulations; (ii)the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, as they may relate to our business or the pharmacy services industry; (iii)pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of our business or the pharmacy services industry; (iv)institution of government enforcement actions against us; (v)adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against us, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against us; or (vi)adverse developments in other pending or future legal proceedings against us or affecting the pharmacy services industry.

(Caremark) was merged with and into a newly formed subsidiary of CVS Corporation, with the CVS subsidiary, Caremark Rx, L.L.C., continuing as the surviving entity (the Caremark Merger).

(2) In 2006, the Company adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No.108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Qualifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.

As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax adjustment of $65.9 million ($40.5 million after-tax) to operating expenses, which represents the cumulative effect of the adjustment for a period of approximately 20 years. Since the effect of this non-cash adjustment was not material to 2004, or any previously reported fiscal year, the cumulative effect was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure KPMG LLP (KPMG) was previously the principal accountants for the Company. On September26, 2007, KPMG was dismissed as the Companys principal accountants.
The decision to change accountants was made by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company at a meeting held on September25, 2007 and followed the Audit Committees review, as part of its corporate governance practices, of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm.
During the fifty-two week periods ended December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, and the subsequent interim period through September26, 2007, there were no: (i)disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure that, if not resolved to KPMGs satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement, or (ii)reportable events as defined in Item304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The audit reports of KPMG on the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the fifty-two week periods ended December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except as follows: KPMGs report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the fifty-two week periods ended December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 contained a separate paragraph stating that As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, CVS Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, effective January1, 2006.

At the same meeting, the Audit Committee determined to engage Ernst& Young LLP (Ernst& Young) as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm commencing with audit services for the fiscal quarter ending September29, 2007.
Ernst& Young served as the independent registered public accounting firm for Caremark Rx, Inc. (Caremark) prior to Caremarks merger with the Company in March 2007. Other than with respect to Ernst& Youngs role as independent registered public accounting firm for Caremark in the case of clause (i)below, during the fifty-two week periods ended December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, and the subsequent interim period through September26, 2007, neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted with Ernst& Young with respect to either (i)the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Companys consolidated financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided by Ernst& Young to the Company that Ernst& Young concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue or (ii)any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement as defined in Item304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in Item304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
