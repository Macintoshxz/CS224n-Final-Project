We are the largest retail drugstore chain in the nation based on store count and hold the number one market share in 34 of the top 100 U.S. drugstore markets, more than any other retail drugstore chain. We also filled more prescriptions than any other retail drugstore chain in America during fiscal 2000. Our current operations are grouped into four businesses: Retail Pharmacy, Pharmacy Benefit Management ("PBM"), Specialty Pharmacy and Internet Pharmacy.         RETAIL PHARMACY ~ As of December 30, 2000, the Retail Pharmacy business        included 4,087 retail drugstores, located in 24 states and the District        of Columbia, operating under the CVS or CVS/pharmacy name. CVS/pharmacy        stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general        merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, greeting cards, film and        photofinishing services, beauty products and cosmetics, seasonal        merchandise and convenience foods. Existing stores generally range in        size from approximately 8,000 to 12,000 square feet, although most new        stores are based on our standard 10,880 square foot freestanding        buildings, which typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. The Retail        Pharmacy is our only reportable segment as it represented approximately        97% of consolidated net sales and operating profit in fiscal 2000.         PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT ~ The PBM business provides a full range of        prescription benefit management services to managed care and other        organizations. These services include plan design and administration,        formulary management, mail order pharmacy services, claims processing and        generic substitution. The PBM business operates under the PharmaCare        Management Services name. One feature that sets PharmaCare apart from        other prescription benefit management providers is its proprietary        Clinical Information Management System. CIMS is a unique communication        system designed to help PharmaCare's clients manage pharmaceutical        utilization by facilitating clinical communications between the payer,        patient, physician and pharmacist. The improved communication enables        physicians to direct utilization to the more clinically effective        therapy. PharmaCare currently manages more than 9 million lives and ranks        as one of the top ten PBMs in the nation.         SPECIALTY PHARMACY ~ As of December 30, 2000, the Specialty Pharmacy        business includes mail order facilities and 46 retail pharmacies, located        in seventeen states and the District of Columbia, operating under the CVS        ProCare name. CVS ProCare is the leading player in the highly fragmented        $14 billion market for patients requiring complex and expensive drug        therapies for long-term health conditions, including treatments for        HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, infertility, and conditions such as multiple        sclerosis and growth hormone deficiency. With its September 2000        acquisition of Stadtlander Pharmacy of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, a        subsidiary of Bergen Brunswig Corporation, CVS ProCare established itself        as the leading specialty mail order pharmacy, and the only one offering        integrated retail and mail order services. Stores are typically 1,500        square feet and include a limited general merchandise offering targeted        to this specific patient population.         INTERNET PHARMACY ~ The Internet Pharmacy business includes a mail order        facility and a complete online retail pharmacy, operating under the        CVS.com name. CVS.com enables customers to order prescriptions and        general merchandise over the internet for in-store pickup or mail        delivery and receive the latest health news and general health        information.  CVS Corporation is a Delaware corporation. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, Rhode Island 02895, telephone (401) 765-1500.                                          2 CVS/PHARMACY STORES  OPERATING STRATEGY ~ Our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of high-quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience. One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to constantly improve service and explore ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We believe our continuing to be the first to market with new products and services, using innovative marketing, introducing more products which are unique to CVS and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences is very important in our ability to maintain customer satisfaction.  CUSTOMERS ~ During fiscal 2000, we served an average of 2.5 million customers per day. Since our sales are to numerous customers, including managed care organizations, the loss of any one customer would not have a material effect on the business. No single customer, including managed care organizations, accounts for more than ten percent of our total sales.  PRODUCTS ~ A typical CVS/pharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise. General merchandise categories include over-the-counter drugs, greeting cards, film and photofinishing services, beauty products and cosmetics, seasonal merchandise and convenience foods.  We centrally purchase most of our merchandise, including prescription drugs, directly from numerous manufacturers and distributors. This purchasing strategy allows us to take advantage of the promotional and volume discount programs that certain manufacturers and distributors offer to retailers. During fiscal 2000, approximately 85% of the merchandise we purchased was received by our distribution centers for redistribution to our stores, while the balance was shipped directly to the stores. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business.  To complement the national brand name products we offer, we also carry a full range of high-quality private label products that are only available through CVS. We carried over 1,500 CVS brand products, which accounted for approximately 12% of our front store sales during fiscal 2000. Due to the success of our private label program, we will continue to assess opportunities to expand our range of private label product offerings.  OPERATIONS ~ As of December 30, 2000, we operated 4,087 CVS and CVS/pharmacy stores, approximately a fourth of which operated on an extended hour or 24-hour basis. Store operations are divided into two areas, pharmacy and front store:           PHARMACY ~ Retail pharmacy sales increased 18.2% to $12.6 billion,          representing 63% of total sales in fiscal 2000, compared to 59% in          fiscal 1999 and 58% in fiscal 1998. During fiscal 2000, we filled 297          million prescriptions, or approximately 11% of the U.S. retail market,          which was more than any other retailer. We believe that our pharmacy          operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business          and strategy due to our ability to attract and retain managed care          customers, favorable industry trends and our on-going program of          purchasing patient prescription files from independent pharmacies.           The growth in managed care has substantially increased the use of          prescription drugs. Managed care providers have made the cost of          prescription drugs more affordable to a greater number of people and          supported prescription drug therapy as an alternative to more expensive          forms of treatment, such as surgery. Payments by third party managed          care providers under prescription drug plans represented 89% of our          total pharmacy sales in fiscal 2000, compared to 87% in fiscal 1999 and          84% in fiscal 1998.                                         3 In a typical third party payment plan, we contract with a third party          payer (such as an insurance company, a prescription benefit management          company, a governmental agency, a private employer, a health          maintenance organization or other managed care provider) that agrees to          pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription          purchases in exchange for reduced prescription rates. Although third          party payment plans provide a high volume of prescription drug sales,          these sales typically generate lower gross margins than other sales due          to the cost containment efforts of third party payers and the          increasing competition among pharmacies for this business. To address          this trend, we have dropped and/or renegotiated a number of third party          programs that fell below our minimum profitability standards. These          continuing efforts have resulted in a stabilization of third party          rates. However, in the event this trend were to continue and we elect          to drop additional programs and/or decide not to participate in future          programs that fall below our minimum profitability standards, we may          not be able to sustain our current rate of sales growth.           The U.S. retail pharmacy market is estimated to exceed $143 billion in          sales for 2000. The pharmacy market is expected to continue to be among          the fastest growing segments in the retail sector as it continues to          benefit from favorable industry trends. These trends include an aging          American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs,          pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for          managing illness and the introduction and aggressive marketing of          several successful new drugs. Each of these trends is contributing to a          strong prescription drug industry, which we believe will continue to          fuel the future growth of our pharmacy sales.           Our pharmacy business also benefits from a program, in which we          purchase prescription files from independent pharmacies. During fiscal          2000, we purchased patient prescription files from over 300 independent          pharmacies. We believe that these prescription files are productive          investments. In many cases, the independent pharmacist will join CVS,          thereby providing continuity in the pharmacist-patient relationship.           FRONT STORE ~ Front store sales, which are generally higher margin than          pharmacy sales, increased to $7.2 billion, representing 37% of total          sales in fiscal 2000, compared to 41% in fiscal 1999 and 42% in fiscal          1998. We believe that effective management of the mix of merchandise in          our stores has been a primary factor in our front store sales gains and          will continue to fuel front store sales growth and increase customer          satisfaction. We intend to continue our front store growth by          continuing to be the first to market with new products and services,          using innovative marketing, introducing more products which are unique          to CVS and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and          preferences. Examples of this are our aggressive expansion of unique          photo services, which has resulted in CVS becoming a leader in one-hour          and online photo services and one of Kodak's largest online customers.          After thorough testing in certain markets, we are currently beginning          the chain wide rollout of our new relationship marketing program, the          ExtraCare Card. Through the ExtraCare Card, we will offer special          promotions and incentives to our best customers to reward their          patronage and encourage increased loyalty.  STORE DEVELOPMENT ~ The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a major role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient, freestanding sites. During fiscal 2000, we opened 388 new stores, which included 35 CVS ProCare stores and 230 relocations. During the last three years we opened over 1,200 new and relocated stores, or over a quarter of our existing store base. We expect to open approximately 300 new stores during fiscal 2001 about half of which are expected to be relocations. During fiscal 2000, we entered four new markets: Chicago, the 2nd largest U.S. drugstore market; Tampa, Florida, the 16th largest U.S. drugstore market; Orlando, Florida, the 27th largest U.S. drugstore market and Grand Rapids, Michigan, the 69th largest U.S. drugstore market. During fiscal 2001, we plan to enter Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the 23rd largest U.S. drugstore market and Las Vegas, Nevada, the 38th largest U.S. drugstore market. Going forward, we expect to enter at least two to three new markets each year. As we open new stores, we maintain our objective of securing a strong position in each market that our stores serve. In fiscal 2000, we held the number one or number two market position in approximately 75% of the 59 top 100 U.S. drugstore markets we served. Our strong market positions provide us with several important advantages, including an ability to save on advertising and distribution costs and an ability to attract managed care providers, who want to provide their members with convenient access to pharmacy services.                                          4 A key part of our store development program is our relocation effort. Our relocation program actively seeks to relocate many of our strip shopping center locations to freestanding sites. Because of their more convenient locations and larger size, relocated stores have typically realized significant improvements in customer count and revenues, driven largely by increased sales of higher margin front store merchandise. We believe our relocation program offers a significant opportunity for future growth, as only 39% of our existing stores were freestanding as of December 30, 2000. We currently expect to have approximately 44% of our stores in freestanding locations by the end of fiscal 2001. Our long-term goal is to have approximately 80% of our stores located in freestanding sites. We cannot, however, guarantee that future store relocations will achieve similar results as those historically achieved.  We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to competing effectively in the current managed care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry.  WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES ~ We generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and our commercial paper program. We currently expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program during fiscal 2001 to support our working capital needs. In addition, we may elect to use additional long-term borrowings and/or other financing sources in the future to support our continued growth. Due to the nature of the retail drugstore business, the majority of our non-pharmacy sales are in cash, while third party insurance programs, which typically settle in less than 30 days, represented 89% of our pharmacy sales in fiscal 2000. Our customer returns are not significant.  INFORMATION SYSTEMS ~ We have invested significantly in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency. Our client-server based systems permit rapid and flexible system development to meet changing business needs, while our scaleable technical architecture enables us to efficiently expand our network to accommodate new stores.         PHARMACY SYSTEMS ~ The Rx2000 computer system enables our pharmacists to        fill prescriptions more efficiently, giving the pharmacists more time to        spend with customers. The system facilitates the management of third        party healthcare plans and enables us to provide managed care providers        with a level of information which we believe is unmatched by our        competitors. We also continue to make significant progress on our        Excellence in Pharmacy Innovation and Care ("EPIC") program. EPIC is a        multiyear project that is reengineering the way our pharmacies        communicate and fill prescriptions. The project includes integrated        workflow improvements, proprietary systems technology and automated        pill-counting machines in high volume stores. We expect EPIC to improve        quality assurance and customer service, while reducing labor costs. We        were one of the first in the industry to introduce Drug Utilization        Review technology that checks for harmful interactions between        prescription drugs, other-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal        remedies. We were also one of the first in the industry to install a        chain wide automatic prescription refill system, called Rapid Rx Refill,        which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day        using a touch-tone telephone. Together, these initiatives are expected to        continue to enhance pharmacy productivity, increase capacity, lower costs        and improve service by lowering customer wait times and enabling        pharmacists to spend more time with customers.         FRONT STORE SYSTEMS ~ Our point-of-sale scanning technology has enabled        us to develop an advanced retail database of information. We use this        information to quickly analyze data on a store-by-store basis to develop        targeted marketing and merchandising strategies. We can also analyze the        impact of pricing, promotion and mix on a category's sales and        profitability, enabling us to develop tactical merchandising plans for        each category by market. We believe that effective category management        increases customer satisfaction and that our category management approach        has been a primary factor in front store comparable sales gains. Our        supply chain initiatives, including our Promotional Forecasting and        Allocation system and an improved store-level Assisted Inventory        Management system, will more effectively link our stores and distribution        centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores        in a manner that both reduces out-of-stock positions and lowers our        investment in inventory. We have already begun to experience tangible        benefits from our supply chain initiatives and we expect to continue to        do so.                                          5 ASSOCIATE DEVELOPMENT ~ As of December 30, 2000, we employed approximately 99,000 associates, about 48,000 of whom are part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers and partners, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores and throughout our organization. Our pharmacists consistently rank among the best in the industry on measurements of trust, relationship building and accessibility. This high level of service and expertise has played a key role in the growth of our company.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSES ~ We have registered or applied for registration of a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks for use in our business. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of the Company and our stores. We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property.  Our pharmacies and pharmacists must be licensed by the appropriate state boards of pharmacy. Our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Because of these licensing and registration requirements, we must comply with various statutes, rules and regulations, a violation of which could result in a suspension or revocation of these licenses or registrations.  COMPETITION ~ The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety and (iv) price. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of independent and other retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, convenience stores and discount merchandisers. With respect to some products, we also compete with mail order providers and internet pharmacies.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ~ Certain statements we make in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (as well as in other public filings, our 2000 Annual Report and Letter to Our Shareholders, our web site, press releases and oral statements made by Company management and/or representatives), constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include information concerning:       o    our belief concerning future sales and net earnings growth;       o    our belief concerning the growth and profitability of CVS ProCare;       o    our belief concerning the growth of our free cash flow;       o    our ability to continue to reduce selling, general and administrative           expenses as a percentage of net sales;       o    our belief that we have sufficient cash flows to support working           capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements;       o    our planned store development, including store openings, number of           freestanding locations, new market entries and capital expenditures;       o    our belief that we can continue to improve sales and operating           performance by relocating existing in-line stores to freestanding           locations;       o    our belief concerning the profitability of CVS.com;       o    our belief that we can continue to reduce inventory levels and improve           inventory turnover; and       o    our future results of operations, including sales and earnings per           common share growth and cost savings and synergies following the Revco           and Arbor mergers.   In addition, statements that include the words "believes", "expects", "anticipates", "intends", "estimates" or similar expressions are forward-looking statements. For all of these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  You should understand that the following important factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report and in the documents which are incorporated by reference (and in our other public filings, press releases and oral statements made by Company management and/or representatives), could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:                                          6 WHAT FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS?  INDUSTRY AND MARKET FACTORS       o    changes in economic conditions generally or in the markets served by           CVS;       o    future federal and/or state regulatory and legislative actions           affecting CVS and/or the chain drugstore industry;       o    consumer preferences and spending patterns;       o    competition from other drugstore chains, from alternative distribution           channels such as supermarkets, membership clubs, mail order companies           and internet companies (e-commerce) and from other third party plans;       o    the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed           care organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies and other           third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs; and       o    changes in accounting policies and practices, including taxation           requirements.  OPERATING FACTORS       o    our ability to continue to implement new computer systems and           technologies;       o    our ability to continue to secure suitable new store locations at           favorable lease terms;       o    the creditworthiness of the purchasers of former businesses whose           store leases are guaranteed by CVS;       o    our ability to continue to purchase inventory on favorable terms;       o    adverse determinations with respect to litigation or other claims;       o    our ability to attract, hire and retain suitable pharmacists and           management personnel; and       o    our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and           promotional programs (including pricing strategies) in the different           geographic markets in which we operate.  ITEM 2. -- PROPERTIES  We lease most of our stores under long-term leases that vary as to rental amounts, expiration dates, renewal options and other rental provisions. We do not think that any individual store lease is significant in relation to our overall business. For additional information on the amount of our rental obligations for our leases, we refer you to the caption Leases on page 29 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000.  Following is a breakdown by state of our 4,133 retail and specialty pharmacy store locations as of December 30, 2000: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alabama*                         137       Maine                             19     Oregon*                         1 California*                        9       Maryland*                        172     Pennsylvania*                 342 Connecticut                      125       Massachusetts*                   324     Rhode Island*                  55 Delaware                           2       Michigan                         240     South Carolina*               177 District of Columbia*             50       Minnesota*                         1     Tennessee*                    141 Florida*                          31       Missouri*                          1     Texas*                          4 Georgia*                         280       New Hampshire                     29     Vermont                         2 Hawaii*                            1       New Jersey                       209     Virginia                      244 Illinois                          73       New York*                        404     Washington*                     1 Indiana                          274       North Carolina                   275     West Virginia                  55 Kentucky                          67       Ohio                             388 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *    State store totals include CVS ProCare stores, which totaled 46 stores      located in 17 States and the District of Columbia as of December 30, 2000.                                          7 As of December 30, 2000, we owned approximately two percent of our 4,133 retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores. Net selling space for our retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores increased from 30.3 million square feet as of January 1, 2000, to 30.8 million square feet as of December 30, 2000.  Our stores are supported by ten company-owned distribution centers, which are located in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Virginia, Indiana, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Michigan. These distribution centers contain an aggregate of approximately 5,400,000 square feet. In addition, we lease additional space near our distribution centers to handle certain distribution needs. We also lease approximately 199,000 square feet in mail order service facilities located in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  We own our corporate headquarters located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which contains an aggregate of approximately 552,000 square feet. We also lease approximately 352,000 square feet in office buildings in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Washington state.  In addition, in connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, we continue to guarantee lease obligations for approximately 1,300 former stores. We are indemnified for these guarantee obligations by the respective purchasers. These guarantees generally remain in effect for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. For additional information, we refer you to the caption Commitments & Contingencies on page 33 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000.  We believe that at the end of existing lease terms, our current leased space can be either re-leased or replaced by alternate space for lease or purchase that is readily available.  ITEM 3. -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We have litigation arising from the normal course of business. In the opinion of management and our independent counsel, we do not believe that any existing claims or litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or future cash flows.  ITEM 4. -- SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS  No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000.
