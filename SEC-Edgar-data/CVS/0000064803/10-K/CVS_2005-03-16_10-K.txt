Business OVERVIEW CVS Corporation is a leader in the retail drugstore industry in the United States with net sales of $30.6 billion in 2004. As of January 1, 2005, we operated 5,375 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 36 states and the District of Columbia, more pharmacy stores than any other retailer. We currently operate in 74 of the top 100 U.S. drugstore markets and hold the number one or number two market share in 51 of these markets. Overall, we hold the number one or number two market share in 73% of the markets in which our retail pharmacies operate. During fiscal 2004, we filled over 366 million prescriptions, or approximately 14% of the U.S. retail pharmacy market. Our current operations are grouped into two businesses: Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM).
Retail Pharmacy ~ As of January 1, 2005, the Retail Pharmacy business included 5,328 retail drugstores, of which 5,261 operated a pharmacy, and the online retail website, CVS.com. The retail drugstores are located in 34 states and the District of Columbia operating under the CVS or CVS/pharmacy name. CVS/pharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, film and photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods, which we refer to as front store products. Existing stores generally range in size from approximately 8,000 to 13,000 square feet, although most new stores range in size from approximately, 10,000 to 13,000 square feet and typically include a drive-thru pharmacy. The Retail Pharmacy is our only reportable segment as it represented approximately 94% of consolidated net sales and 91% of consolidated operating profit in 2004.
Pharmacy Benefit Management ~ The PBM business provides a full range of prescription benefit management services to managed care and other organizations. These services include mail order pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy services, plan design and administration, formulary management and claims processing. The PBM business, which, as of January 1, 2005, covered approximately 30 million lives, operates under the PharmaCare Management Services name, and ranks as the fourth largest, full service PBM in the nation. Our PBMs specialty pharmacy business represents the largest integrated retail and mail provider of specialty pharmacy services in the nation. Our specialty pharmacy focuses on supporting individuals that require complex and expensive drug therapies to treat conditions such as organ transplants, HIV/AIDS and genetic conditions such as infertility, multiple sclerosis and certain cancers. As of January 1, 2005, we operated 47 specialty pharmacies, operating under the PharmaCare Pharmacy name, located in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and three mail order facilities. Specialty pharmacy stores average 2,000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a limited assortment of front store items such as alternative medications, homeopathic remedies and vitamins.
On July 31, 2004 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including from Eckerd Corporation (Eckerd). The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed included 1,268 Eckerd retail drugstores and Eckerd Health Services, which includes Eckerds mail order and pharmacy benefit management businesses (collectively, the Acquired Businesses). We believe that the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses is consistent with our long-term strategy of expanding our retail drugstore business in high-growth markets and increasing the size and product offerings of our pharmacy benefits management business.
CVS Corporation is a Delaware corporation. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, Rhode Island 02895, telephone (401) 765-1500. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol CVS. General information about CVS is available through our website at http://www.cvs.com . Our financial press releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge on the investor relations portion of our website at http://investor.cvs.com .
2 Table of Contents RETAIL PHARMACY BUSINESS Operating Strategy ~ Our mission is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use. We believe ease of use means convenience for the time-starved customer. As such, our operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of quality merchandise at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation and convenience (easy-to-access, clean, well-lit and well stocked). One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more personalized product offerings and services. We believe that continuing to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences is very important to our ability to maintain customer satisfaction.
Products ~ A typical CVS/pharmacy store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and private label merchandise. Front store categories include over-the-counter drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, film and photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods. We purchase our merchandise from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the business. Consolidated net sales by major product group are as follows: PercentageofNetSales (1) 2004 2003 2002 Prescription drugs 70 % 69 % 68 % Over-the-counter and personal care 10 10 10 Beauty/cosmetics 5 6 6 General merchandise and other 15 15 16 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Percentages are estimates based on store scanning data.
Pharmacy sales have been growing, and we believe will continue to grow, at a faster pace than front store sales. Pharmacy sales represented 70.0% of total sales in 2004, compared to 68.8% in 2003 and 67.6% in 2002. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a critical part of our business due to our ability to attract and retain managed care customers, favorable industry trends (an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for managing illness, the proliferation of new pharmaceutical products, and a new federally funded prescription drug benefit to begin in 2006, promulgated as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which should increase utilization) and our on-going program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies. We believe our pharmacy success results from our investment in people and technology. Given the nature of prescriptions, people want their prescriptions filled accurately and ready when promised, by professional pharmacists using the latest tools and technology. During 2003, we introduced our Pharmacy Service Initiative (PSI). This initiative is designed to ensure that customers who bring in prescriptions, are greeted by a pharmacy technician who verifies insurance, medication availability and refill authorizations at the point of drop-off, resolving potential problems that could delay a prescription being filled. Further evidencing our belief in the importance of pharmacy service is our continual investment in technology such as our Excellence in Pharmacy Innovation and Care (EPIC) system, our touch-tone telephone reorder system, Rapid Refill TM and our online business, CVS.com.
Front store sales benefited from our strategy to be the first to market with new and unique products and services, using innovative marketing and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer needs and preferences. We were the first retail pharmacy to market with a digital photo solution throughout our chain, including being the first to offer printing from digital camera phones, the ability to upload digital photos to CVS.com and have them available for in store pickup the following day, and the first to offer a one-time-use digital camera. A key component of our strategy is our ExtraCare card program, which is helping us continue to build our loyal customer base. With over 50 million members as of January 1, 2005, ExtraCare is one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the United States. ExtraCare allows us to balance our marketing efforts so we can reward our best customers by providing them automatic sale prices, customized coupons, ExtraBucks TM rewards and other benefits. Another component of our front store strategy is our unique product offerings, which include a full range of high-quality private label products that are only available through CVS. We currently carry over 1,700 CVS brand products, which accounted for approximately 12% of our front store sales during 2004. In addition, CVS offers a unique front store focus on cosmetics, health and beauty by being a U.S. distributor of several European cosmetics and skin care lines, including Lumene, Avene and Vichy. In 2004, we added the exclusive Christophe hair care line.
3 Table of Contents Store Development ~ The addition of new stores has played, and will continue to play, a major role in our continued growth and success. Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets, adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient, freestanding sites. During 2004, we opened 129 new stores, acquired 1,268 stores, relocated 96 stores and closed 201 stores (including 160 stores of the Acquired Businesses). During the last five years, we opened more than 1,400 new and relocated stores. Approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years. During 2005, we expect to open approximately 275-300 new or relocated stores. We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in desirable geographic markets are essential components to competing effectively in the current managed care environment. As a result, we believe that our store development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our leadership position in the retail drugstore industry.
Information Systems ~ We have invested significantly in information systems to enable us to deliver a high level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating efficiency. We were one of the first in the industry to introduce Drug Utilization Review technology that checks for harmful interactions between prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies. We were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic prescription refill system, CVS Rapid Refill  , which enables customers to order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touch-tone telephone. In 2001, we completed the rollout of EPIC, a multiyear project that reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions. The project included integrated workflow improvements, proprietary systems technology and automated pill-counting machines in high volume stores. We expect EPIC will continue to improve quality assurance and customer service, while reducing labor costs. In 2002, we completed the rollout of our Assisted Inventory Management (AIM) system for non-promotional front store merchandise and expanded the system to include pharmacy items in 2003. This system is designed to more effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces out-of-stock positions and lowers our investment in inventory. In 2003, we began the rollout of VIPER, a transaction monitoring application designed to mitigate inventory losses attributable to process deficiencies or fraudulent behavior by providing visability to all transactions processed through our POS systems. Since this initial rollout, we have continued to implement modules for the pharmacy dispensing system and an application designed for our inventory replenishment systems. These latter applications are the first in the retail chain drug sector. All the store systems of the Acquired Businesses were converted to the CVS store systems as of January 1, 2005.
Customers ~ Managed care and third party plans account for 94% of our 2004 pharmacy sales. Since our sales are to numerous payors, including employers and managed care organizations, the loss of any one payor should not have a material effect on the business. Accordingly, no single customer accounts for 10% or more of our total sales.
We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid plans. Total sales from all such plans were approximately 9% of consolidated net sales, or 12% of total pharmacy sales, during 2004.
Seasonality ~ The majority of our sales, particularly pharmacy sales, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, front store sales tend to be higher during the December holiday season. For additional information, we refer you to the Note Quarterly Financial Information on page 45 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005.
Working Capital Practices ~ We fund the growth of our business through a combination of cash flow from operations, sale-leaseback transactions, commercial paper and long-term borrowings. For additional information on our working capital practices, we refer you to the caption Liquidity & Capital Resources on pages 20 and 21 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005, which is incorporated by reference herein. Due to the nature of the retail drugstore business, the majority of our non-pharmacy sales are in cash, while third party insurance programs, which typically settle in less than 30 days, represented 94% of our pharmacy sales in 2004. Our customer returns are not significant.
4 Table of Contents Associate Development ~ As of January 1, 2005, we employed approximately 145,500 associates; about 67,000 of them are part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service to our customers and partners, we devote considerable time and attention to our people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training friendly and helpful associates to work in our stores and throughout our organization.
Intellectual Property and Licenses ~ We have registered or applied for registration of a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks and business licenses for use in our business. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of the Company and our stores. We are not aware of any facts that could negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property. Our pharmacies and pharmacists must be licensed by the appropriate state boards of pharmacy. Our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Because of these licensing and registration requirements, we must comply with various statutes, rules and regulations, a violation of which could result in a suspension or revocation of these licenses or registrations.
Competition ~ The retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety and (iv) price. In each of the markets we serve, we compete with independent and other retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacy benefit managers and other mail order prescription providers, discount merchandisers, membership clubs and internet pharmacies.
Item 2. Properties We lease most of our stores under long-term leases that vary as to rental amounts, expiration dates, renewal options and other rental provisions. For additional information on the amount of our rental obligations for our leases, we refer you to the Note Leases on page 37 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005.
As of January 1, 2005, we owned approximately 3% of our 5,375 retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores. Net selling space for our retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores increased 33.3% to 43.5 million square feet as of January 1, 2005 compared to 32.6 million square feet as of January 3, 2004. During 2004 we acquired 1,268 retail locations for which approximately 300 remodels have been completed as of January 1, 2005, and we plan to complete the remainder by July of 2005. Approximately half of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five years.
We own five distribution centers located in Alabama, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas and lease eight additional facilities located in Florida, Indiana, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. The thirteen distribution centers total approximately 8,175,000 square feet as of January 1, 2005. During 2004, we began operating our newest distribution center in Ennis, Texas, which utilizes state of the art storage and retrieval systems and is the first of its kind in North America.
We own our corporate headquarters building located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which contains approximately 568,000 square feet. We lease approximately 110,000 square feet of additional office space in Rhode Island. We also lease approximately 97,000 square feet in two mail order service facilities located in Florida and Pennsylvania. In addition, we own one mail order facility located in Pennsylvania, which contains approximately 80,000 square feet.
In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, we continue to guarantee lease obligations for approximately 525 former stores. We are indemnified for these guarantee obligations by the respective purchasers. These guarantees generally remain in effect for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. For additional information, we refer you to the Note Commitments & Contingencies on page 42 in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005.
Management believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the Companys anticipated needs. At the end of the existing lease terms, management believes the leases can be renewed or replaced by alternate space.

Legal Proceedings Beginning in August 2001, a total of nine actions were filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts asserting claims under the federal securities laws. The actions were subsequently consolidated under the caption In re CVS Corporation Securities Litigation , No. 01-CV-11464 (JLT) (D. Mass.) (the Securities Action). On April 8, 2002, a consolidated and amended complaint was filed. The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the Company, its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, and asserts claims for alleged securities fraud under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder on behalf of a class of persons who purchased shares of the Companys common stock between February 6, 2001 and October 30, 2001.
6 Table of Contents On June 7, 2002, all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. This motion was denied by the court on December 18, 2002, and on January 24, 2003, defendants accordingly filed an answer to the consolidated amended complaint. Discovery on merits issues concluded in September 2004 and expert discovery concluded in December 2004. On January 14, 2005, all defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On March 8, 2005 this motion was denied and a trial date has been set for May 9, 2005. The Company believes the Securities Action is entirely without merit and intends to continue to defend the action vigorously.
On October 29, 2004, a class action lawsuit asserting claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act was filed under the caption Fescina v. CVS Corp., et. al.
, No. 04-CV-12309 (JLT) (D. Mass.) (the ERISA Action). The purported class includes persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of the CVS 401(k) plan between December 1, 2000 and October 30, 2001. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and designated as related to the Securities Action. The complaint names as defendants the Company, its chief executive officer, certain members of the CVS Board of Directors, and certain unnamed fiduciaries. The Company believes the ERISA Action is entirely without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously.
On December 17, 2004, Richard Krantz filed a shareholder derivative suit under the caption Krantz v. Ryan, et. al.
, No. 04-CV-12650 (REK) (D. Mass), based upon essentially the same allegations that underlie the Securities Action and the ERISA Action. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint names as defendants the Company (as nominal defendant), its chief executive officer, its chief financial officer, and certain members of its Board of Directors. The Company believes this action is entirely without merit and intends to defend the action vigorously.
As has been reported in the press, the Rhode Island Attorney Generals office, the Rhode Island Ethics Commission, and the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Rhode Island are investigating the business relationships between certain former members of the Rhode Island General Assembly and various Rhode Island companies, including CVS. CVS will continue to cooperate fully with these investigations.
The United States Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are investigating whether any civil or criminal violations resulted from certain practices engaged in by CVS and others in the pharmacy industry with regard to dispensing one of two different dosage forms of a generic drug under circumstances in which some state Medicaid programs at various times reimbursed one dosage form at a different rate from the other. The Company is in discussions with various governmental agencies involved and believes its conduct was lawful and justified.
The Company is also a party to other litigation arising in the normal course of its business, none of which is expected to be material to the Company.

(2) In 2004, the Company conformed its accounting for operating leases and leasehold improvements to the views expressed by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants on February 7, 2005. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax adjustment of $9.0 million ($5.4 million after-tax) to selling, general and administrative expenses and $56.9 million ($35.1 after-tax) to depreciation and amortization, which represents the cumulative effect of the adjustment for a period of approximately 20 years. Since the effect of this non-cash adjustment was not material to any previously reported fiscal year, the cumulative effect was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004.
(3) As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets at the beginning of 2002, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill amortization totaled $31.4 million pre-tax ($28.2 million after-tax) in 2001 and $33.7 million pre-tax ($31.9 million after-tax) in 2000.
(4) Operating profit includes the pre-tax effect of the charges discussed in Note (1) above and the following merger, restructuring, and other non-recurring charges and gains: (i) in 2004, $65.9 million ($40.5 after-tax) relating to conforming the Companys accounting for operating leases and leasehold improvements, (ii) in 2001, $346.8 million ($226.9 million after-tax) related to restructuring and asset impairment costs associated with the strategic restructuring and the $3.5 million ($2.1 million after-tax) net non-recurring gain resulting from the net effect of the $50.3 million of settlement proceeds received from various lawsuits against certain manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs and the Companys contribution of $46.8 million of these settlement proceeds to the CVS/pharmacy Charitable Trust, Inc. to fund future charitable giving, and (iii) in 2000, $19.2 million ($11.5 million after-tax) non-recurring gain representing partial payment of the Companys share of the settlement proceeds from a class action lawsuit against certain manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs.
(5) In 2004, the Companys assessment of tax reserves resulted in a reduction that was principally based on finalizing certain tax return years and on a recent court decision relevant to the industry. As a result, the Company reversed $60.0 million of previously recorded tax reserves through the income tax provision.
(6) Net earnings and net earnings per common share include the after-tax effect of the charges and gains discussed in Notes (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) above.

9 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk During 2004, the Company refinanced a portion of the short-term borrowings issued to finance the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses with, $650 million of 4.0% unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2009, and $550 million of 4.875% unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2004. To manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in market interest rates, the Company entered into Treasury-Lock Contracts (the Contracts) with total notional amounts of $600 million. The Contracts settled during the third quarter of 2004 in conjunction with the placement of the longer-term financing. The settlement of the Contracts resulted in an unrealized loss of $32.8 million net of a $12.0 million tax benefit.
As of January 1, 2005, the Company had no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in place and believes that its exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments, principally interest rate risk inherent in its debt portfolio is not material.
