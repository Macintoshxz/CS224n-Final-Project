4 Table of Contents ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview of Business The Clorox Company is a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer and professional products with approximately 8,200 employees worldwide as of June 30, 2014, and fiscal year 2014 net sales of $5.6 billion. Clorox sells its products primarily through mass retail outlets, e-commerce channels, distributors, and medical supply providers. Clorox markets some of the most trusted and recognized consumer brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products , Kingsford  charcoal, Pine-Sol  cleaners, Liquid-Plumr  , Poett  home care products, Fresh Step  cat litter, Glad  bags, wraps and containers, Hidden Valley  and KC Masterpiece  dressings and sauces, Brita  water-filtration products and Burts Bees  natural personal care products. The Company also markets brands for professional services, including Clorox Healthcare  and Dispatch  infection control products for the healthcare industry. The Company manufactures products in more than a dozen countries and markets them in more than 100 countries. More than 80% of the Companys brands hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share positions in their categories. The Company manufactures products in more than a dozen countries and markets them in more than 100 countries. The Company was founded in Oakland, Calif., in 1913 and is incorporated in Delaware.
The Companys strategy is focused on creating stockholder value by investing in new and existing sales channels and countries with profitable growth potential and attractive categories. In particular the Company continues to reshape its portfolio toward businesses aligned with consumer megatrends in the areas of health and wellness, sustainability, consumer fragmentation and affordability/value.
In fiscal year 2014, the Company introduced its 2020 Strategy, its strategic growth plan, which focuses on long-term, profitable growth and strong stockholder returns through the year 2020. These long-term financial goals include annual net sales growth of 3-5%, market share growth, annual EBIT margin growth between 25-50 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 10-12%. The Company faced a difficult environment in fiscal year 2014, including unfavorable foreign exchange rates, soft categories in U.S. retail and increased competitive activity. To address these challenges the Company introduced line extensions, new products and product improvements, including Clorox  Smart Seek bleach, which brightens white areas of mostly white striped or patterned clothes; Clorox  disinfecting wipes for glass and tub and shower, which expand the use of wipes into new areas of the home; Liquid-Plumr  hair clog eliminator; Clorox  Fraganzia scented bleach, which offers fresh new scents combined with splash-less technology; and Burts Bees  facial towelettes and lip crayons. In addition, the Company continued to expand its professional products business through product innovation and partnerships, including finalizing a partnership to offer ultraviolet technology for professional healthcare surface disinfection. Internationally, the Company focused on the expansion of its Burts Bees  brand, which continued its strong growth, and expanded its adjacent countries in various locations, including the Middle East and North Africa. In fiscal year 2014, the Company repurchased approximately three million shares of its common stock for $260 million, returned $368 million in dividends to stockholders and announced a 4% increase in its quarterly dividend payable in August 2014.
Finally, the Company continued its commitment to corporate responsibility by maintaining strong, transparent governance practices and continuing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, water and energy use and waste to landfills. The Company was also recognized as one of the most responsible companies by Corporate Responsibility magazine and one of the greenest companies in the 2014 Newsweek Green Rankings. In fiscal year 2014, The Clorox Company Foundation awarded approximately $4 million in cash grants, and the Company made product donations valued at approximately $9 million and contributed another $1 million to deserving nonprofits through cause marketing programs for social and charitable causes.

6 Table of Contents Information about the results of each of the Companys reportable segments for the last three fiscal years and total assets as of the end of the last three fiscal years, reconciled to the consolidated results, is set forth below. For additional information, refer to the information set forth under the caption Segment Results from Continuing Operations in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 7 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
(Dollars in millions) Fiscal Year Cleaning Household Lifestyle International Corporate Total Company Net sales 2014 $ 1,776 $ 1,709 $ 936 $ 1,170 $ - $ 5,591 2013 1,783 1,693 929 1,218 - 5,623 2012 1,692 1,676 901 1,199 - 5,468 Earnings (losses) from       continuing operations before       income taxes 2014 428 326 258 76 (227 ) 861 2013 420 336 259 96 (258 ) 853 2012 381 298 265 119 (272 ) 791 Total assets 2014 887 745 869 1,190 567 4,258 2013 905 799 878 1,202 527 4,311 2012 942 818 887 1,219 489 4,355 Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution In the United States, most of the Companys products are nationally advertised and sold to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, and dollar, military and other types of retail stores primarily through a direct sales force, and to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a combination of direct sales teams and a network of brokers . The Company sells institutional, janitorial, and food-service versions of many of its products through distributors, and sells healthcare products through a direct sales force and medical supply providers. Outside the United States, the Company sells products to the retail trade through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners. Additionally, the Company sells many of its products through online retailers and sells its Burts Bees  natural personal care products directly to consumers online.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations For detailed financial information about the Companys foreign and domestic operations, including net sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic area, see Note 19 Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 61 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials The Company purchases raw materials from numerous unaffiliated domestic and international suppliers, some of which are sole-source or single-source suppliers. Interruptions in the delivery of these materials could adversely impact the Company. Key raw materials used by the Company include resin, diesel, sodium hypochlorite, corrugate and agricultural commodities. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal year 2014 but costs for many materials continued to increase amid volatility and inflation in some key geographic and commodity markets, which the Company expects to continue in fiscal year 2015. The Company generally utilizes supply and forward-purchase contracts to help ensure availability and help manage the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations. However, the Company is nonetheless highly exposed over the short term to changes in the prices of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 17 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto and Risk Factors  Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Companys profits in Item 1.A herein.
7 Table of Contents Patents and Trademarks Most of the Companys brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks. The Companys brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business, and the Company vigorously protects its trademarks from apparent infringements. Maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the Companys success. The Companys patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted, where appropriate, against apparent infringements.
Seasonality Most sales of the Companys charcoal products occur in the first six months of each calendar year. A moderate seasonality trend also occurs in the net sales of the Companys Burts Bees  natural personal care products, with slightly more than half of the annual net sales occurring during the months of October through March. Short-term borrowings may be used to fund inventories of those products in the off season.
Customers Net sales to the Companys largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 26% of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012 and occurred in each of the Companys reportable segments. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years. During fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Companys five largest customers accounted for 45%, 45% and 44% of its net sales, respectively, and its ten largest customers accounted for 55% of its net sales for each of the three fiscal years.
Competition The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. Most of the Companys products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with private label brands. Competition comes from similar and alternative products, some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the Company. Depending on the product, the Companys products compete on product performance, brand recognition, price, value or other benefits to consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising support. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvements to maintain its relative market position.
Research and Development The Company conducts research and development primarily at its facility located in Pleasanton, Calif., which the Company has leased since 2011. The Pleasanton facility consists of approximately 357,000 square feet of leased space, utilizing state-of-the-art labs and open work spaces to encourage creativity, collaboration and innovation. In addition to the leased facility in Pleasanton, Calif., the Company conducts research and development activities in Meriden, Ct.; Kennesaw, Ga.; Willowbrook, Il.; Midland, Mi.; Durham, NC; Cincinnati, Oh.; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and consumer insight research to develop commercially viable consumer-preferred products with innovative and distinctive features. The Company incurred expenses of $125 million, $130 million and $121 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, on direct research activities relating to the development of new products and/or the maintenance and improvement of existing products. In addition, the Company also obtains technologies from third parties for use in its products. Royalties relating to such technologies are reflected in the Companys cost of sales. For further information regarding the Companys research and development costs, see Research and development costs in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 5 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

9 Table of Contents ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Report or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Companys business operations and financial results.
The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations.
In fiscal year 2014, approximately 20% of the Companys net sales were generated in international markets. The Company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: challenges in Venezuela, where   the Companys business and cash flows have been and continue to be adversely   impacted by governmental restrictions such as currency exchange, price and margin controls, as well as other difficult operating conditions; challenges in Argentina, where   the devaluation of the Argentine peso has negatively affected the Companys   net sales and net earnings; economic or political   instability, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina; price controls and related   government actions, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina; foreign currency fluctuations,   currency controls and inflation, which may adversely affect the Companys   ability to do business in certain markets and reduce the U.S. dollar value of   revenues, profits or cash flows it receives from non-U.S.   markets; difficulty in obtaining   non-local currency (e.g., U.S. dollars) to pay for the raw materials needed to   manufacture the Companys products and contract-manufactured products,   particularly in Venezuela and Argentina; restrictions on or costs   relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States,   including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations,   particularly in Venezuela and Argentina; the imposition of tariffs, trade   restrictions, import and export laws or other government actions generating a   negative impact on the Companys business; the possibility of   nationalization, expropriation of assets or other similar government actions,   particularly in Venezuela and Argentina; difficulties in hiring and   retaining qualified local employees; civil unrest, work stoppages and   labor disputes; difficulties in obtaining or   unavailability of raw materials; increased credit risk of local   customers, suppliers and distributors; difficulties in enforcing   intellectual property and contractual rights; and challenges relating to   enforcement of or compliance with laws.
Many of the risks described above are particularly acute in Venezuela. The operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with high inflation, political instability, governmental restrictions in the form of currency exchange, price and margin controls and the possibility of government actions such as further devaluations, business occupations and intervention or expropriation of assets. For nearly three years, more than two thirds of the Companys products in Venezuela have been subject to price controls despite significant double-digit inflation. In addition, the foreign exchange controls in Venezuela limit the Venezuela businesss ability to remit dividends and pay intercompany balances. For further information regarding Venezuela, see Venezuela in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 9 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Argentina also presents a difficult operating environment, including price controls on some of the Companys products, a devaluing currency and inflation. In addition, in July 2014, the Argentine government defaulted on debt payment agreements. For further information regarding Argentina, see Argentina in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 11 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
More broadly, the risks described above could have a significant adverse impact on the Companys ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position. For example, lower prices resulting from price controls could continue to adversely affect the Companys margins, profitability and cash flow, and make it difficult for the Company to offset other risks, such as high inflation. The Companys small sales volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.
10 Table of Contents In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales, profits and cash flow driven by movements of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. Although the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these hedges only offset a small portion of the Companys exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and, therefore, the Companys reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
Inflation is another risk associated with the Companys international operations. For example, Venezuela has been designated, for financial reporting purposes, as a highly inflationary economy, and Argentina could in the future be designated as such. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings. Other countries in which the Company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries currencies may be devalued, or both, which may negatively impact the Companys operations.
The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced net sales, profitability and cash flow.
The Company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the United States and in its international markets. Most of the Companys products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category. The Company also faces competition from retailers, including club stores, dollar stores and mass merchandisers, which are increasingly offering private label brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the Companys products in certain categories. During times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands. Increased purchases of private label products could reduce sales volumes of the Companys higher-margin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lower-margin offerings.
The Companys products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, price, value or other benefits to consumers. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions, and the Company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position. If the Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including its use of digital media to reach consumers, are not effective or adequate, the Companys sales and volume may be negatively impacted.
Some of the Companys competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company can. In addition, the Companys competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions and/or reduce prices, which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth.
Unfavorable worldwide, regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the Company and consumers of its products, which would negatively affect the Companys financial performance and liquidity.
Although the Company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands, unfavorable economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the Companys products. Consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending, which may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the Companys product mix from higher-margin to lower-margin products. Consumers may increase purchases of lower-priced or non-branded products and the Companys competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lower-priced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times, which may negatively impact the Companys sales and volume.
Global markets continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2014, and continuing volatility, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina, could continue to harm the Companys business. Although the Company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations overall and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities to meet its current needs, if the current credit conditions were to significantly worsen, the Company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms when needed, which could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and capital resources. Financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the Companys customers, suppliers and other business partners. If customers financial conditions are severely affected, customers may reduce their purchases of the Companys products or the Company may not be able to collect accounts receivable, each of which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results.
11 Table of Contents Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Companys profits and cash flow.
Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, including resin, sodium hypochlorite, linerboard, soybean oil, solvent, corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities, or increases in the cost of energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services may harm the Companys profits and operating results. The Company anticipates continued commodity and other cost increases in fiscal year 2015. If such increases occur or exceed the Companys estimates and the Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, its profits and operating results will be harmed. In addition, if the Company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, and commodity costs decline, the Company may not be able to sustain its price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. While the Company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume, its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity costs, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 17 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
To reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases, the Company uses derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. The extent of the Companys derivative position at any given time depends on the Companys assessment of the markets for these commodities, the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments. Many of the commodities used by the Company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments. If the Company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase, or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease, the Companys costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors costs and the Companys financial results could be adversely affected.
Sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve, and price increases, market and category declines and changes to the Companys product and geographic mix may adversely impact the Companys financial results.
A large percentage of the Companys revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition. During fiscal year 2014, approximately 80% of the Companys net sales were generated in U.S. markets. U.S. markets for cleaning products are generally characterized by high household penetration. The Companys ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation, investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product improvements, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and develop, acquire or successfully launch new products, it may not achieve its sales growth objectives. Even when the Company is successful in increasing sales within particular product categories, a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for its products can have a negative impact on the Companys financial results.
In addition, changes to the mix of products the Company sells, as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold, can adversely impact the Companys operating expenses, the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition, which could cause its profitability and cash flow to suffer. The Companys financial outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix of sales, and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix of sales, the Companys operations and results could be negatively affected.
Dependence on key customers could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
A limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Companys net sales. Net sales to the Companys largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 26% of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, and occurred in each of the Companys reportable segments. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years. During fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Companys five largest customers accounted for 45%, 45% and 44% of its net sales, respectively, and its ten largest customers accounted for 55% of its net sales for each of the three fiscal years. The Company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Companys largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label or competitors products, may harm the Companys sales and reduce the ability of the Company to bring new innovative and improved products to consumers.
12 Table of Contents In addition, the Companys business is based primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease their purchases from the Company, causing the Companys sales and profits to decline. Furthermore, unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the Companys customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell, resulting in lower purchases of the Companys products by these customers.
The Company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the United States and internationally. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers, who may change their business strategies, demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics, a shift in focus away from branded products toward private label or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Such consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on other customers of the Company, which could in turn negatively impact the Companys sales. If the Company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise, the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.
Government regulations could impose material costs.
Generally, the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and advertising of the Companys products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the Companys products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Companys product claims and advertising are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, among other regulatory agencies. Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. The Companys international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products. There is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls. Additionally, the Company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Companys operations or activities are not in compliance with the law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could expose the Company to significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the Company.
It is expected that federal, state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the Companys operations. For example, the Company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment, including as a result of evolving climate change standards, and new and increased regulation in other areas, such as with respect to conflict minerals. Such regulation could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs. In addition, pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits, executive compensation and corporate governance, could also increase the Companys costs. These risks may be increased by the Companys acquisitions of HealthLink and Aplicare, Inc., which manufacture products subject to additional regulations.
If the Company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, import detentions, injunctions, product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to its charcoal business, could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. As the Company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through Burts Bees  , HealthLink  , Aplicare  , Caltech Industries and Clorox  CareConcepts, an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices. In order to comply with these laws and regulations, the Company may be required to make changes to product formulation, labeling or marketing claims , perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims , make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken.
13 Table of Contents Reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the Companys business.
The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs, including sole-source and single-source suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies. New suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental, industry and Company standards, which can require additional investment and time. If the Company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the Companys key suppliers becomes insolvent, experiences financial distress or environmental, economic or other outside factors impact its operations, the Company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected.
Profitability and cash flow could suffer if the Company is unable to successfully implement its strategies, generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes.
The Company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets, and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities. The Company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions. If the Company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases, the Company may not realize all anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect its financial results. In addition, the Company establishes long-term strategies, such as the 2020 Strategy, which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 3-5%, market share growth, annual EBIT margin growth between 25-50 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 10-12%. The Company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product improvements. These goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results.
In addition, the Company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency, including occasionally closing facilities or plants. Gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time, there may be one-time costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the Companys strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results. If the Company is unable to implement its strategies or if its strategies do not achieve the intended effects, if it does not realize cost savings and other efficiencies or if it is unable to efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes, the Companys financial results could suffer. These plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the Companys relationships with employees or customers, which could also adversely affect the Companys financial results.
Product liability, commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the Companys sales and operating results, including cash flow.
The Company has in the past  paid, and may be required in the future to pay, for losses or injuries  purportedly caused by its products. Such claims may be based on allegations  that, among other things, the Companys products contain contaminants or provide  inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use, or damage property or  persons. Product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could  harm the Companys reputation, sales and operating results. In addition, if any  of the Companys products is found to be defective, the Company may recall it,  which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the  Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product  liability claims may be subject to a retention , exceed the amount of insurance  coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies.
In addition, the Company is, and may in the future become, a party to litigation and other disputes, including advertising disputes with competitors, consumer class actions, labor claims, securities litigation and litigation in foreign jurisdictions. In general, claims made by or against the Company in litigation, disputes or other proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, disputes or proceedings with which the Company currently is or may in the future become involved. The impact of these matters on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition could be material. See Contingencies in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 16 and Note 11 Other Contingencies and Guarantees of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 46 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto for additional information related to these matters, including litigation related to its discontinued operations in Brazil.
14 Table of Contents The Company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions or successfully expand into adjacent categories and countries, which could adversely impact its financial results.
The Companys future performance and growth depends on its innovation and ability to successfully develop or license and introduce new products, brands, line extensions and product improvements or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories, sales channels or countries. The Company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals. The development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. New product development and marketing efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include product development or launch delays, which could result in the Company not being first to market and the failure of new products, brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance. If product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful, costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the Companys profits could be adversely affected. In addition, if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the Companys existing products, the Companys financial results could be materially adversely affected.
Acquisitions, new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful, which could impact the Companys results.
In connection with the Companys strategy, the Company expects to continue to seek to increase growth through acquisitions. Not only is it difficult to identify good acquisition candidates and to compete successfully for such candidates, but these transactions also involve numerous risks, including risks relating to the Companys ability to: successfully integrate acquired   companies, products, systems or personnel into the Companys existing   business, especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside   of the United States; minimize any potential interruption to the ongoing business   of the Company or the acquired company; successfully enter categories and markets in which the   Company may have limited or no prior experience; achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial   or strategic benefits from acquisitions; retain key relationships with employees, customers, partners   and suppliers of acquired companies; and maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies   throughout acquired companies.
Acquired companies or operations or newly created ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow that justify the investments. Future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, including litigation, an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would increase, among other things, the Companys exposure to foreign exchange rate risks, local regulations and potential liabilities relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the Companys acquisitions diminish in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect its operating results.
The Company may also divest certain assets, businesses or brands that do not meet the Companys strategic objectives or growth targets. With respect to any divestiture, the Company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms. Any divestiture could affect the profitability of the Company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer (i.e., stranded costs) that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture. The Company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture.
Any potential future acquisitions, new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the business.
15 Table of Contents Cyber attacks, privacy breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the Companys ability to conduct business.
The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct its business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to communicating within the Company and with customers, consumers and other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business. The Company has made significant progress with its implementation of enterprise-wide upgrades to its hardware, software and operating systems, including its enterprise system in Latin America, which replaced legacy systems and is expected to streamline operations and enable future growth. However, legacy systems remain in countries where the Company conducts business outside of the United States and Latin America. If the Companys existing and/or future technology systems, third-party service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the Companys business, the Companys business may be adversely impacted.
Although the Company has network security measures in place, the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users or system failures, including Internet outages. While the Company has business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches or other similar events, and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business, which may adversely impact the Companys business. Furthermore, the Company sells its Burts Bees  and gd  natural personal care products and Kingsford  lifestyle products directly to consumers online and offers customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and it could experience cyber attacks or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or Company information. If the Company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology system or such a breach or other breakdown results in unauthorized disclosure of business, personal or stakeholder information, the Company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm and may be exposed to legal liability, which may adversely affect the Companys results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, if the Companys service providers, suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the Companys supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect the Companys operations.
Loss of, or inability to attract, key personnel could adversely impact the Companys business.
The Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to retain its key personnel, including its executive officers and senior management team. The unexpected loss of one or more of the Companys key employees could disrupt its business. The Companys success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Companys headquarters and largest research facility are located. As the Company expands into new categories or markets, including more regulated businesses, it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets. The Company may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business.
Harm to the Companys reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business.
Maintaining a strong reputation with consumers, customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the Companys business. The Company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the Companys reputation and the reputation of its brands. These programs include ethics and compliance, sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives. Despite these efforts, negative publicity about the Company, including product safety or similar concerns, whether real or perceived, could occur, and the Companys products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues. The Company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties, which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety, quality and other concerns. Negative publicity, posts or comments about the Company or its brands could also be widely disseminated through the use of social media. Such events, if they were to occur, could harm the Companys image and adversely affect its business, as well as require resources to rebuild the Companys reputation.
Environmental matters create potential liabilities.
The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations, and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the Company for other purposes.
16 Table of Contents The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities. In addition, some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the Company has sent waste, may be identified and become the subject of remediation. The Company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
The Company had a recorded liability of $14 million and $13 million as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters, including response actions at various locations. One matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability as of both June 30, 2014 and 2013. The Company has agreed to be liable for 24.3% of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a cost-sharing arrangement with a third party. With the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures, maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated 30-year remediation period. Currently, the Company cannot accurately predict the timing of future payments that may be made under this obligation. In addition, the Companys estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy of remediation efforts, changes in remediation requirements and the future availability of alternative clean-up technologies. Although it is reasonably possible that the Companys exposure may exceed the amount recorded, any amount of such additional exposures, or range of exposures, is not estimable at this time. See Contingencies in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 16 and Note 11 Other Contingencies and Guarantees of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 46 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto for additional information related to these liabilities.
The Company also handles and/or transports hazardous substances, including but not limited to chlorine, at some of its international plant sites. A release of such chemicals, whether in transit or at the Companys facilities, due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability and business disruptions.
The facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the Companys control.
Operations at facilities of the Company, its suppliers, service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, demonstrations, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. The Companys corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, temporary loss of access to critical data, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. Any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business.
Failure to maximize, successfully assert or successfully defend the Companys intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness.
The Company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its brands, products and packaging for its products. The Company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the Companys products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties infringe the Companys intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of the Companys brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Companys brands and harm its sales. The failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial condition.
If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impacted.
If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Companys business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. If holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, it could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, operating results and financial condition.
17 Table of Contents Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third partys intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Companys business. For example, if the Company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor, another vendor may claim the Company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals. The Company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims.
The Companys substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the Company from fulfilling its obligations, and the Company may incur substantially more debt in the future, which could exacerbate these risks.
As of June 30, 2014, the Company had $2.3 billion of debt, including $575 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in fiscal year 2015. The Companys substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could: require the Company to dedicate a   substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its   indebtedness, which would reduce   the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements,   capital expenditures, future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limit the Companys flexibility in   planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in   its business and the industries in   which it operates; place the Company at a competitive   disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and limit, along with the financial and other restrictive   covenants in the Companys debt documents, its ability to borrow additional   funds.
Additionally, failure by the Company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company. Further, certain terms of the agreements governing the Companys over-the-counter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Companys credit ratings, as assigned by Standard & Poors and Moodys to the Company and its counterparties, to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating. As of June 30, 2014, the Company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investment-grade ratings with both Standard & Poors and Moodys. However, if the Companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization.
The Company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes, subject to compliance with the Companys existing restrictive debt covenants. As of June 30, 2014, the Company could add approximately $1.7 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants, although the actual amount that the Company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify. In addition, the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the Companys credit rating, economic conditions or otherwise.
The Companys continued growth and expansion and reliance on third-party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting, which could harm its business and financial results.
Clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Companys continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, the Company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Companys ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud.
18 Table of Contents The Companys judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Companys earnings and cash flow.
Significant judgment is required to determine the Companys effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions. The Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards. Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Companys effective tax rate and the Companys financial results. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate, which would have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, refer to the information set forth in Note 17 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 53 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
The estimates and assumptions on which the Companys financial statement projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect the Companys future cash flows and stock price.
The Companys financial statement projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, category growth, market share projections, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, goodwill, market share projections, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase its shares, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. While the Companys projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, the Companys actual results may differ materially from its financial outlook. Any material variation between the Companys projections and its actual results may adversely affect the Companys stock price.
The Company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.
Although the Company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under a share repurchase program, any determinations to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its common stock will be based primarily upon the Companys financial condition, results of operations and business requirements, the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the Companys stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. The Companys ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon, among other things, its cash balances and future cash requirements, results of operations, financial condition and net earnings, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Companys control. In the event the Company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases, the Companys stock price could be adversely affected.
The Companys business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest.
In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies, including the Company. During fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the Company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist, which resulted in significant costs to the Company. If such a proposal were to be made again, the Company would incur significant costs, which would have an adverse effect on the Companys financial results. Stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt the Companys business and divert the attention of the Companys management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to the Companys future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, which could adversely affect the Companys business.
19 Table of Contents ITEM 1.B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Production and Distribution Facilities The Company owns or leases and operates 24 manufacturing facilities in North America and owns or leases and operates 15 manufacturing facilities outside North America. The Company also leases six regional distribution centers in North America and several other warehouse facilities. Management believes the Companys production and distribution facilities, together with additional facilities owned or leased and operated by various unaffiliated finished-product suppliers and distribution center service providers that serve the Company, are adequate to support the business efficiently, and that the Companys properties and equipment have generally been well maintained. The Company is continually performing a supply-chain efficiency analysis, which may lead to closures of domestic and international manufacturing facilities and the redistribution of production between its remaining facilities and contract manufacturers to optimize availability and capacity and to seek to reduce operating costs.
Offices and Research and Development Facilities Since 2011, the Company has leased a facility located in Pleasanton, Calif., which houses the Companys research and development group as well as other administrative and operational support personnel. The facility features state-of-the-art labs and open work spaces to encourage creativity, collaboration and innovation. The Company leases office space in Oakland, Calif., for its corporate headquarters. The Company owns a research and development facility located at its plant in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Company also conducts research and development activities and engineering research in leased facilities in Meriden, Ct.; Kennesaw, Ga.; Willowbrook, Il.; Midland, Mi.; Cincinnati, Oh.; and Durham, NC. Leased sales offices and other facilities are located at a number of other locations.
Encumbrances None of the Companys owned facilities are encumbered to secure debt owed by the Company.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to routine litigation incidental to its business in the United States and in international locations, including various lawsuits and claims relating to issues such as contract disputes, product liability, patents and trademarks, advertising, employee and other matters. Although the results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for or disclosed in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Exhibit 99.1 hereto, will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Companys consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
