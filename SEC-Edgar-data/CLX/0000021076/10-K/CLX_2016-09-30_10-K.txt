In this Report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms the Company and Clorox refer to The Clorox Company and its subsidiaries.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview of Business The Clorox Company is a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer and professional products with fiscal year 2016 net sales of $5.8 billion and approximately 8,000 employees worldwide as of June 30, 2016. Clorox sells its products primarily through grocery and mass retail outlets, e-commerce channels, wholesale distributors and medical supply distributors. Clorox markets some of the most trusted and recognized consumer brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products, Pine-Sol  cleaners, Liquid-Plumr  clog removers, Poett  home care products, Fresh Step  cat litter, Glad  bags, wraps and container products, Kingsford  charcoal, Renew Life  digestive health products, Hidden Valley  dressings and sauces, Brita  water-filtration products, and Burts Bees  natural personal care products. The Company also markets brands through professional services channels, including infection control products for the healthcare industry under Clorox Healthcare  and Clorox Commercial Solutions  . More than 80% of the Companys sales are generated from brands that hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share positions in their categories. The Company was founded in Oakland, California in 1913 and is incorporated in Delaware.
The Companys 2020 strategy focuses on delivering long-term, profitable growth and total shareholder return. The Companys long-term financial goals include annual net sales growth of 3-5%, annual EBIT margin growth of 25-50 basis points and annual free cash flow of 10-12% of net sales.
On May 2, 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the digestive health company Renew Life for $290 million. The purchase of the Renew Life business aligns with the Companys acquisition strategy to target leading brands with attractive margins in high-growth categories, particularly in health and wellness. Results for Renew Lifes domestic business are reflected in the Household reportable segment and results for Renew Lifes international business are reflected in the International reportable segment. Included in the Companys results for fiscal year 2016 was $21 million of Renew Lifes global net sales.
In fiscal year 2016, the Company delivered strong results including 2% net sales growth and an 8% increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations, despite a highly competitive environment in the U.S. and a difficult macro-environment, including unfavorable foreign exchange rates and challenging economies in International markets.
1 Table of Contents The Company focused on driving sales growth in its U.S. business, leveraging incremental demand building investments and innovation, to drive category growth and market share improvements. In particular, the Company launched new products in many categories in fiscal year 2016, including the Brita  Infinity pitcher, Burt's Bees  lipsticks, Clorox Healthcare  nasal antiseptic swabs, Clorox Healthcare  Optimum-UV Enlight, Fresh Step  with Febreze  , Glad  DualDefense  trash bags, Hidden Valley  Greek yogurt dressing.
In international markets, the Company focused on a number of measures to address economic challenges experienced in fiscal year 2016. Significant currency declines across the majority of countries and high inflation in several markets were partially offset by price increases and cost savings initiatives. Despite these challenges, the Companys international business continued to play an important strategic role, with No. 1 and No. 2 brands in multiple countries and strong growth of the Burts Bees  brand internationally.
In fiscal year 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock for $254 million, paid $398 million in dividends to stockholders and announced a 4% increase in its quarterly dividend from prior year, payable in August 2016.
Finally, the Company continued its commitment to corporate responsibility by maintaining strong and transparent environmental, social and governance practices. The Company remained committed to lowering water and energy use, solid waste to landfill and greenhouse gas emissions as part of its 2020 operational footprint reduction goals. The Company was recognized as one of the top corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine and named as one of the greenest companies in the 2016 Newsweek Green Rankings. In fiscal year 2016, together The Clorox Company Foundation and The Burts Bees Greater Good Foundation awarded approximately $5 million in cash grants, and the Company made product donations with a fair market value of approximately $8 million and contributed more than $1 million to deserving nonprofits through cause marketing programs for social and charitable causes.
In fiscal year 2017, Clorox anticipates ongoing challenges that may impact its sales and margins, including unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Argentina, and a continuation of challenging international economies. In addition, the Company is monitoring anticipated slower U.S. category growth, driven primarily by expected competitive activity and changes to commodity costs and manufacturing and logistics costs.
For additional information on recent business developments, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Exhibit 99.1, incorporated herein by reference.

2 Table of Contents Three of the Companys product lines have accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales during each of the past three fiscal years. In fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales of liquid bleach represented approximately 13%, 14% and 13% of the Companys consolidated net sales, respectively, approximately 25%, 26%, and 26% of net sales in the Cleaning segment for each such years, respectively, and approximately 27%, 27% and 28% of net sales in the International segment, respectively. Sales of trash bags represented approximately 13%, 14% and 13% of the Companys consolidated net sales in each of the fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and approximately 37%, 38% and 36% of net sales in the Household segment, respectively, for each such years. Sales of charcoal represented approximately 11% of the Companys consolidated net sales and approximately 34% of net sales in the Household segment in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Information about the results of each of the Companys reportable segments for the last three fiscal years and total assets as of the end of the last three fiscal years, reconciled to the consolidated amounts, is set forth below. Certain non-allocated administrative costs, interest income, interest expense and various other non-operating income and expenses are reflected in Corporate. For additional information, refer to the information set forth under the caption Segment Results from Continuing Operations in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Exhibit 99.1.

The Company sells institutional, janitorial, and food-service versions of many of its products through distributors using a network of brokers, and sells healthcare products through a direct sales force and medical supply distributors. Outside the United States, the Company sells products to the retail trade through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners. Additionally, the Company sells many of its products through online retailers.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations For detailed financial information about the Companys foreign and domestic operations, including net sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic area, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials The Company purchases raw materials from numerous unaffiliated domestic and international suppliers, some of which are sole-source or single-source suppliers. Interruptions in the delivery of these materials could adversely impact the Company. Key raw materials used by the Company include resin, diesel, sodium hypochlorite, corrugated cardboard and agricultural commodities. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal year 2016. Costs for resin and diesel decreased in fiscal year 2016.
However, costs for many materials continued to increase amid volatility and inflation in some key geographic and commodity markets, which the Company expects to continue in fiscal year 2017. The Company generally utilizes supply and forward-purchase contracts to help ensure availability and help manage the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations. However, the Company is nonetheless highly exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 99.1 and Risk Factors  Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed, and in the future may harm, the Companys net earnings and cash flow in Item 1.A.
3 Table of Contents Patents and Trademarks Most of the Companys brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks. The Companys brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business, and the Company vigorously protects its trademarks from apparent infringements. Maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the Companys success. The Companys patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted, where appropriate, against apparent infringements.
Seasonality Most sales of the Companys charcoal products occur in the first six months of each calendar year. A moderate seasonality trend also occurs in the net sales of the Companys Burts Bees  natural personal care products, with slightly more than half of the annual net sales occurring during the months of October through March. Short-term borrowings may be used to fund inventories of those products in the off season.
Customers Net sales to the Companys largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 27%, 26% and 27% of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and occurred in each of the Companys reportable segments. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Companys five largest customers accounted for 46%, 45%, and 45% of its consolidated net sales for each of the three fiscal years, respectively.
Competition The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. The Companys products compete with other nationally advertised brands and with private label brands within each category. Competition comes from similar and alternative products, some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the Company. The Companys products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, and price. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising support. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it typically requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvements to maintain its relative market position. For further information regarding the intense competition the Company faces, see Risk Factors  The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced net sales, net earnings and cash flow in Item 1.A.
Research and Development The Company conducts research and development primarily at its facility located in Pleasanton, CA, which the Company has leased since 2011. The Pleasanton facility consists of approximately 357,000 square feet of leased space, utilizing state-of-the-art labs and open work spaces to encourage creativity, collaboration and innovation. In addition to the leased facility in Pleasanton, CA, the Company conducts research and development activities in Meriden, CT; Willowbrook, IL; Durham, NC; Cincinnati, OH; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
4 Table of Contents The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and consumer insight research to develop commercially viable consumer-preferred products with innovative and distinctive features. The Company incurred expenses of $141 million, $136 million and $125 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on direct research activities relating to the development of new products and/or the improvement of existing products. In addition, the Company obtains technologies from third parties for use in its products. Royalties relating to such technologies are reflected in the Companys Cost of products sold. For further information regarding the Companys research and development costs, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 99.1.
Environmental Matters For information regarding noncapital expenditures related to environmental matters, see the discussions below under Risk Factors  Environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the Companys results of operations or financial condition in Item 1.A. No material capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance are presently anticipated.
Number of Persons Employed As of June 30, 2016, the Company employed approximately 8,000 people.

ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Report or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Companys business operations and financial results.
The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced net sales, net earnings and cash flow.
The Company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the United States and in its international markets. Most of the Companys products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category. The Company also faces competition from retailers, including club stores, grocery, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers, which are increasingly offering private label brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the Companys products in certain categories. During times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands. Increased purchases of private label products could reduce net sales of the Companys higher-margin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lower-margin offerings.
5 Table of Contents The Companys products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, and price. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have significant impacts on consumer purchasing decisions, and the Company is increasingly using digital media marketing and promotional programs to reach consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it typically requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position. If the Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including its use of digital media to reach consumers, are not effective or adequate, the Companys net sales may be negatively impacted.
Some of the Companys competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company can. In addition, the Companys competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions and/or reduce prices, which could lead to reduced net earnings and adversely affect growth.
Uncertain worldwide, regional and local economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the Company and consumers of its products, which would negatively affect the Companys financial performance and liquidity.
Although the Company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands, uncertain economic conditions may continue to negatively affect consumer demand for the Companys products. Consumers may also be sensitive to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions and reduce discretionary spending, which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in the Companys product mix from higher-margin to lower-margin products. Consumers may increase purchases of lower-priced or private label products, and the Companys competitors may increase levels of advertising and promotional activity for lower-priced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during uncertain economic times, which may negatively impact the Companys net sales.
Global markets continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2016, and continuing volatility could continue to harm the Companys business. In addition, financial market volatility could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and capital resources. Uncertain economic conditions and financial market volatility may also adversely affect the financial condition of the Companys customers, suppliers and other business partners. If customers financial conditions are severely affected, customers may reduce their purchases of the Companys products or the Company may not be able to collect accounts receivable, each of which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business operations or financial results.
Sales growth objectives may be difficult to achieve, and price increases, market and category declines and changes to the Companys product and geographic mix may adversely impact the Companys financial results.
A large percentage of the Companys revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition. During fiscal year 2016, approximately 83% of the Companys net sales were generated in U.S. markets. The Companys ability to achieve sales growth depends on its ability to drive growth through innovation, expansion into new product categories, channels and countries, investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product improvements, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories and/or develop, acquire or successfully launch new products or brands, it may not achieve its sales growth objectives. Even when the Company is successful in increasing market share within particular product categories, a decline in the markets for such product categories has had and can continue to have a negative impact on the Companys financial results.
In addition, changes to the mix of products the Company sells, as well as the mix of countries in which its products are sold, can adversely impact the Companys net sales, profitability and cash flow. The Companys financial outlook assumes a certain volume and product mix, and if actual results vary from this projected volume and product mix, the Companys business operations and financial results could be negatively affected.
6 Table of Contents Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed, and in the future may harm, the Companys net earnings and cash flow.
Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, including resin, sodium hypochlorite, linerboard, soybean oil, solvent, corrugated cardboard and other chemicals and agricultural commodities, or increases in the cost of energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed, and in the future may harm, the Companys profits and operating results. We distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by rail and truck. Reduced availability of rail or trucking could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials in a timely manner.
The Company believes commodity and other cost increases are possible in the future. If such increases occur or exceed the Companys estimates and the Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, its profits and operating results will be harmed. In addition, if the Company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, and commodity costs decline, the Company may not be able to sustain its price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. While the Company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume, its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.
To reduce the cost volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases, the Company uses derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. The extent of the Companys derivative position at any given time depends on the Companys assessment of the markets for these commodities, the cost volatility in the markets and the cost of the derivative instruments. Many of the commodities used by the Company in its products do not have actively traded derivative instruments. If the Company does not or is unable to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase, or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease, the Companys costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors costs and the Companys financial results could be adversely affected. For further information regarding the Companys use of derivative instruments, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 99.1.
Dependence on key customers could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
A limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Companys net sales. Net sales to the Companys largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 27%, 26% and 27% of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and occurred in each of the Companys reportable segments. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Companys five largest customers accounted for 46%, 45%, and 45% of its consolidated net sales for each of the three fiscal years, respectively. The Company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Companys largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label or competitors products, may harm the Companys net sales and reduce the ability of the Company to offer new innovative and improved products to consumers. In addition, any loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer, even if such loss or reduction relates to a key customer of a business unit of the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the Companys business is based primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease their purchases from the Company, causing the Companys net sales and net earnings to decline. Furthermore, unfavorable market conditions or competitive pressures may cause the Companys customers to reevaluate the number and mix of brands they sell, resulting in lower purchases of the Companys products by these customers.
7 Table of Contents The Company continues to see retailer consolidation both in the United States and internationally. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers, who have in the past changed, and may in the future change, their business strategies, demand lower pricing or special packaging or impose other burdensome requirements on product suppliers. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics, a shift in focus away from branded products toward private label or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. These large consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on the Companys other customers, which could in turn lead to such customers demanding lower pricing or special packaging or imposing other onerous requirements on the Company. If the Company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease due to customer inventory reductions or otherwise, the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.
Cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or a failure of key information technology systems could adversely impact the Companys ability to conduct business.
The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct its business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to communicating within the Company and with customers, consumers and other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and implementing other processes involved in managing the business. Although the Company has made progress with its implementation of enterprise-wide upgrades to its hardware, software and operating systems, legacy systems still remain. If the Companys existing and/or future technology systems, third-party service providers and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the Companys business, the Companys business may be adversely impacted.
Although the Company has  network security measures in place, the systems may be vulnerable to computer  viruses or other malicious codes, security breaches and other disruptions from  unauthorized users or system failures, including Internet outages. While the  Company has business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or  cease to function properly due to any number of causes, including catastrophic  events, power outages, security breaches or other similar events, and if the  business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely  basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct  business, which may adversely impact the Companys business. Furthermore, the  Company sells its Burts Bees  natural personal care products, Renew  Life  digestive health products and other products directly to  consumers online, provides websites, mobile apps and connected devices, and  offers promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it  may receive personal information, and it or its vendors could experience  cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that result in  unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or Company information.  In August 2015, the federal government brought an indictment against brokers and hackers for stealing advanced, nonpublic  press releases of various public companies from news wires and trading on  securities using the information from such press releases. If the Company  suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology,  including such cyber-attack, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incident  involving one of the Companys vendors, that result in unauthorized disclosure  or significant unavailability of business, financial, personal or stakeholder  information, the Company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business  harm and may be exposed to legal liability, which may adversely affect the  Companys results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, if the  Companys service providers, suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted  or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the  Companys supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect  the Companys business operations.
Government regulations could impose material costs.
Generally, the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and advertising of the Companys products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the Companys products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Companys product claims and advertising are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, among other regulatory agencies. Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. The Companys international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products. There is also a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls. Additionally, the Company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Companys operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the Company to significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the Company.
8 Table of Contents In particular, because of the Companys extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
It is expected that federal, state and foreign governments will continue to introduce new and expanded legislation affecting the Companys operations, which may require the Company to increase its resources, capabilities and expertise in such areas. For example, the Company is subject to regulations regarding the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment, including as a result of evolving climate change standards, and new and increased regulation in other areas, such as with respect to conflict minerals. Such regulation could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain raw materials or could increase its acquisition and compliance costs. In addition, pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits, executive compensation and corporate governance, could also increase the Companys costs. These risks may be increased by the Companys recent acquisition of Renew Life, which manufactures products subject to additional regulations.
If the Company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, import detentions, injunctions, product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to its charcoal business, could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. As the Company expands its natural personal care and healthcare businesses such as through Burts Bees  , HealthLink  , Aplicare  and Caltech Industries, an increasing number of its products have and will become subject to regulations and laws relating to drugs and medical devices. In addition, as the Company enters the digestive health space through its acquisition of Renew Life  , its products are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements. In order to comply with these laws and regulations, the Company may be required to make changes to product formulation, labeling or marketing claims, perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims, make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken.
9 Table of Contents The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations.
In fiscal year 2016, approximately 17% of the Companys net sales were generated in international markets, including approximately 3% of the Companys net sales in Argentina. The Company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with its foreign operations, including the following:  economic or political instability, particularly       in Argentina;  price controls and related government     actions;  foreign currency fluctuations, currency       controls and inflation, particularly in Argentina, which may adversely       affect the Companys ability to do business in certain markets and reduce       the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits or cash flows it generates in       non-U.S. markets;  difficulty in obtaining non-local currency       (e.g., U.S. dollars) to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture       the Companys products and contract-manufactured products;  restrictions on or costs related to the       repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible       taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations;  the imposition of tariffs, trade restrictions,       import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative       impact on the Companys business;  difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified       employees;  civil unrest, work stoppages and labor     disputes;  employment litigation related to employees,       contractors and suppliers, particularly in Argentina;  difficulties in obtaining or unavailability of       raw materials;  potential loss of distribution channels as a       result of retailer consolidation;  increased credit risk of customers, suppliers       and distributors;  potential harm to third parties, the Companys       employees and/or surrounding communities, and related liabilities and       damages to the Companys reputation, from the use, storage and       transportation of chlorine in certain international markets where chlorine       is used in the production of bleach, whether such actions are undertaken       by the Company or by the Companys business partners;  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property       and contractual rights;  lack of well-established or reliable, and       impartial legal systems in certain countries where the Company   operates;  challenges relating to enforcement of or       compliance with local laws and regulations and with U.S. laws affecting       operations outside of the United States, including without limitation, the       Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  the possibility of nationalization,       expropriation of assets or other similar government actions; and  risks related to the Companys discontinued       operations in Venezuela.
The risks described above could have a significant adverse impact on the Companys ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition. The Companys small sales volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.
In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to its net sales, net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. A weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow. Although the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these hedges only offset a small portion of the Companys exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and, therefore, the Companys reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
10 Table of Contents Inflation is another risk associated with the Companys international operations. For example, Argentina could in the future be designated as a highly inflationary economy. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in net earnings. Other countries in which the Company operates may also become highly inflationary or such countries currencies may be devalued, or both, which may negatively impact the Companys business operations and financial results.
For further information regarding Argentina, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 99.1.
Acquisitions, new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful, which could impact the Companys business operations and financial results.
In connection with the Companys strategy, the Company expects to continue to seek acquisition opportunities, such as the recent acquisition of Renew Life, which competes in the digestive health category. However, the Company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive prices. In addition, all acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks, including risks relating to the Companys ability to:  successfully integrate acquired companies, products, systems or       personnel into the Companys existing business, especially with respect to       businesses or operations that are outside of the United States;  minimize any potential interruption to the       ongoing business of the Company or the acquired company;  successfully enter categories and markets in       which the Company may have limited or no prior experience, such as the       digestive health category;  achieve expected synergies and obtain the       desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions;  achieve distribution expansion related to       products, categories and markets from acquisitions;  retain key relationships with employees,       customers, partners and suppliers of acquired companies; and  maintain uniform standards, controls,       procedures and policies throughout acquired companies.
Acquired companies or operations or joint ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations. Future acquisitions or ventures could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, including litigation, an increase in expenses related to certain assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject the Company to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to, among other things, increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes, government price control, repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the Companys acquisitions diminish in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect its operating results and/or net earnings per share.
The Company may also divest certain assets, businesses or brands that do not meet the Companys strategic objectives or growth targets. With respect to any divestiture, the Company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms. Any divestiture could affect the profitability of the Company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer (i.e., stranded costs) that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture. The Company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture.
In addition, any potential future acquisitions, new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and resources from matters that are core or critical to the Companys business.
11 Table of Contents The Company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions or successfully expand into adjacent categories and countries, which could adversely impact its financial results.
The Companys future performance and growth depends on innovation and its ability to successfully develop or license capabilities to introduce new products, brands, line extensions and product improvements or enter into or expand into adjacent product categories, sales channels or countries. The Company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve its innovation goals. The development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research and development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. In addition, effective and integrated systems are required for the Company to gather and use consumer data and information to successfully market its products. New product development and marketing efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include product development or launch delays, which could result in the Company not being first to market and the failure of new products, brands and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance. If product introductions or new or expanded adjacencies are not successful, costs associated with these efforts may not be fully recouped and the Companys net earnings could be adversely affected. In addition, if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the Companys existing products, the Companys financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected .
Reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to the Companys business.
The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs, including sole-source and single-source suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies. New suppliers have to be qualified under Company standards and may also have to be qualified under governmental and industry standards, which can require additional investment and time. The Company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality and price levels needed for its business or if any of the Companys key suppliers becomes insolvent, experiences financial distress or environmental, economic or other outside factors impact its operations.
Product liability, commercial claims or other legal proceedings could adversely affect the Companys net sales and operating results, including cash flow.
The Company has in the past paid, and may be required in the future to pay, for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products. Such claims may be based on allegations that, among other things, the Companys products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use, have defective packaging, fail to perform as advertised, or damage property or persons. Product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the Companys reputation, sales and operating results. In addition, if any of the Companys products is found to be defective, the Company may recall it, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. In July 2016, the Company voluntarily recalled three of the Liquid-Plumr  products, which recall affects products manufactured prior to March 22, 2016. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may be subject to a retention, exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of the policies.
In addition, the Company is, and may in the future become, the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal actions, government investigations and proceedings from time to time, including advertising disputes with competitors, consumer class actions, including those related to advertising claims, labor claims, breach of contract claims, antitrust litigation, securities litigation, premises liability claims and litigation in foreign jurisdictions. In general, claims made by or against the Company in litigation, investigations, disputes or other proceedings have been and can in the future be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect its business or financial results or condition. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation, investigations, disputes or proceedings with which the Company currently is or may in the future become involved. The impact of these matters on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition could be material. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for additional information related to these matters.
12 Table of Contents Profitability and cash flow could suffer if the Company is unable to successfully implement its strategies, generate anticipated cost savings and efficiencies or efficiently manage supply chain and manufacturing processes.
The Company continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by setting aggressive annual cost savings targets, and it expects ongoing cost savings from its continuous improvement activities. The Company anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions. If the Company cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans or the cost of making these changes increases, the Company may not realize all anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect its financial results or its long-term strategies, such as the 2020 Strategy, which includes financial goals such as annual net sales growth of 3-5%, annual EBIT margin growth between 25-50 basis points and annual free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of about 10-12%. The Company also continues to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product improvements. These goals and strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results, and the Company may fail to achieve one or more of the financial goals for one or more of the relevant fiscal years. In addition, the Company expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency, including occasionally closing facilities or plants. Gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time, there may be one-time costs relating to facility closures or other restructurings and anticipated cost savings and the Companys strategies may not be implemented or may fail to achieve desired results. If the Company is unable to implement its strategies or if its strategies do not achieve the intended effects, if it does not realize cost savings and other efficiencies or if it is unable to efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing processes, the Companys financial results could suffer. These plans and strategies could also have a negative impact on the Companys relationships with employees or customers, which could also adversely affect the Companys financial results.
Loss of, or inability to attract, key personnel could adversely impact the Companys business.
The Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to retain its key personnel, including its executive officers and senior management team. The unexpected loss of one or more of the Companys key employees could disrupt its business. The Companys success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Companys headquarters and largest research facility are located. As the Company expands into new categories or markets, including more regulated businesses, it will also require personnel with relevant training and experience in such categories or markets. The Company may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future, and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business.
Harm to the Companys reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business.
Maintaining a strong reputation with consumers, customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the Companys business. The Company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the Companys reputation and the reputation of its brands. These programs include ethics and compliance, sustainability and product safety and quality initiatives. Despite these efforts, negative publicity about the Company, including product safety, quality, efficacy or similar concerns, whether real or perceived, could occur, and the Companys products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues. The Company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties, which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety, quality and other concerns. In addition, widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. Negative publicity, posts or comments on social media or network sites about the Company or its brands, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through the use of social media. Such events, if they were to occur, could harm the Companys image and adversely affect its business, as well as require resources to rebuild the Companys reputation.
13 Table of Contents Environmental matters create potential liabilities that could adversely affect the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances and climate change. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations, and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the Company for other purposes.
The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities. In addition, some of its present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the Company has sent waste, may be identified and become the subject of remediation. The Company could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
The Company had a recorded liability of $14 million and $12 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to certain environmental matters, including response actions at various locations. One matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability as of both June 30, 2016 and 2015. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1 for additional information related to these liabilities.
The Company also handles and/or transports hazardous substances, including but not limited to chlorine, at some of its international plant sites. A release of such chemicals, whether in transit or at the Companys facilities, due to accident or an intentional act, could result in substantial liability and business disruptions.
The facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the Companys control.
Operations at facilities of the Company, its suppliers, service providers and retail customers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, demonstrations, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. The Companys corporate headquarters and primary research and development facility are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, temporary loss of access to critical data, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. Any such disruption could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business.
Failure to maximize, successfully assert or successfully defend the Companys intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness.
The Company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its brands, products and packaging for its products. The Company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the Companys products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties infringe the Companys intellectual property rights, they may dilute or diminish the value of the Companys brands and products in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Companys brands and harm its net sales. The failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial condition.
14 Table of Contents If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impacted.
If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party marks, ideas or technologies, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of such trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Companys business and the obligation to pay for past infringement. If holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause the Company to become less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, operating results and financial condition.
Even if the Company is not found to infringe a third partys intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect the Companys business. For example, if the Company seeks proposals from multiple vendors for a new product or innovation and chooses to partner with a particular vendor, another vendor may claim the Company infringed its intellectual property rights by using information gathered from the vendor proposals. The Company could incur material legal costs and related expenses to defend against such claims and the Company could incur significant costs associated with discontinuing to use, provide or manufacture certain products, services or trademarks even if it is ultimately found not to have infringed such rights.
An increase in the value of the Companys Glad  business would result in an increase in the Companys purchase obligation for The Procter & Gamble Companys, P&Gs, 20% interest in that business, which may adversely affect the Companys net earnings and cash flow. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Companys net earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected more by an extension or a termination of the agreement related to the Glad  business.
In January 2003, the Company entered into a venture agreement with P&G related to the Companys Glad  bags, wraps and containers business. In connection with this agreement, P&G provides research and development support to the Glad  business. The agreement with P&G will expire in January 2023 unless the parties decide, on or prior to January 2018, to extend the term of the agreement for another 10 years.
Unless extended, the agreement will require the Company to purchase P&Gs 20% interest in January 2023 for cash at fair value. As of June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of P&Gs interest was $448 million, of which $302 million has been recognized by the Company and is reflected in Other liabilities in the Companys June 30, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized, and any future changes in the fair value of P&Gs interest, is charged to Cost of products sold on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the agreement. The estimated fair value of P&Gs interest increased significantly in 2016 and may continue to change up until any such purchase by the Company of P&Gs interest. Any additional significant increases in the fair value of such interest may adversely affect the Companys net earnings and cash flow.
If the Company and P&G decide not to extend the term of the agreement, this decision may harm the terms on which the Company has access to innovation from P&G. Alternatively, if the Company and P&G decide to extend the term of the agreement, there can be no assurance that any future innovation will result. In either case, net earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted. For additional information, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.
15 Table of Contents The Companys substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its business operations and financial results and prevent the Company from fulfilling its obligations, and the Company may incur substantially more debt in the future, which could exacerbate these risks.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had over $2 billion of debt. The Companys substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:  require the Company to       dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to       payments on its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its       cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures,       future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  limit the Companys       flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic       conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it       operates;  place the Company at a competitive       disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;       and  limit, along with the financial and other       restrictive covenants in the Companys debt documents, its ability to       borrow additional funds.
Additionally, failure by the Company to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in its debt documents could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company. Further, certain terms of the agreements governing the Companys over-the-counter derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Companys credit ratings, as assigned by Standard & Poors and Moodys to the Company and its counterparties, to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating. As of June 30, 2016, the Company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investment-grade ratings with both Standard & Poors and Moodys. However, if the Companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments in net liability positions could request full collateralization.
The Company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, repurchase shares or fund other activities for general business purposes, subject to compliance with the Companys existing restrictive debt covenants. As of June 30, 2016, the Company could add approximately $2 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants, although the actual amount that the Company may be able to borrow in the future may not equal this amount. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify. In addition, the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the Companys credit rating, economic conditions or otherwise. In this regard, failure to maintain the Company's credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.
The Company is subject to risks related to its discontinued operations in Venezuela.
On September 22, 2014, the Companys Venezuela subsidiary announced that it was discontinuing its operations, effective immediately, and seeking to sell its assets. On September 26, 2014, the Company reported that Venezuelan Vice President Jorge Arreaza announced, with endorsement by President Nicols Maduro, that the Venezuelan government had occupied the production facilities of the Companys Venezuela subsidiary. On November 6, 2014, the Company reported that the Venezuelan government had published a resolution granting a government-sponsored Special Administrative Board full authority to restart and operate the business formerly operated by the Companys Venezuela subsidiary, thereby reaffirming the governments expropriation of its assets. Further, President Nicols Maduro announced the governments intention to facilitate the resumed production of bleach and other cleaning products at the Venezuela plants. The Venezuelan governments actions raise grave concerns, as the production of cleaning products, in particular bleach, is a highly specialized and technical process. Any restarting of operations in Venezuela is or would be without the consent or involvement of the Company and its affiliates, and any resumed production processes would be outside the Companys control. The Company has advised repeatedly that it and its affiliates cannot be responsible for the safety of any workers and the surrounding communities or for the safety, quality or effectiveness of any product that may be produced under the Venezuelan governments takeover or any use of the names and trademarks of the Company and its affiliates. Nevertheless, the Company may face liabilities or costs associated with any such unauthorized resumption of operations by the Venezuelan government or others.
16 Table of Contents The Company may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.
Although the Company has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its shares subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs, any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on the Companys common stock or to repurchase the Companys common stock will be based primarily upon the Companys financial condition, results of operations and business requirements, the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of the Companys stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. The Companys ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends will depend upon, among other things, its cash balances and future cash requirements, results of operations, financial condition and net earnings, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Companys control. In the event the Company does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases, the Companys stock price could be adversely affected.
The Companys continued growth and expansion and reliance on third-party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting, which could harm its business and financial results.
Clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Companys continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets, such as its recent acquisition of Renew Life, may place significant additional pressure on the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, the Company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Companys ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and shareholder claims.
The Companys judgments regarding the accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Companys net earnings and cash flow.
Significant judgment is required to determine the Companys effective tax rate and evaluate its tax positions. The Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards. Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Companys effective tax rate and the Companys financial results. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate, which would have an adverse effect on the Companys operating results. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, see the information set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1.
The estimates and assumptions on which the Companys financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause its actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect the Companys future profitability, cash flows and stock price.
The Companys financial projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, category growth, market share projections, product pricing, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, goodwill, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and the Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in its existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase its shares, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. While the Companys financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, the Companys actual results may differ materially from its financial projections. Any material variation between the Companys financial projections and its actual results may adversely affect the Companys future profitability, cash flows and stock price.
17 Table of Contents The Companys business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest.
In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies, including the Company. During fiscal years 2012 and 2011, the Company was the target of an unsolicited takeover proposal from a stockholder activist, which resulted in significant costs to the Company. If such a proposal were to be made again, the Company would incur significant costs, which would have an adverse effect on the Companys financial results. Stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt the Companys business and divert the attention of the Companys management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to the Companys future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, the perception that the Company needs a change in the direction of its business, or the perception that the Company is unstable or lacks continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and may make it more difficult for the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, which could adversely affect the Companys business. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
ITEM 1.B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Production and Distribution Facilities The Company owns or leases and operates 23 manufacturing facilities in North America and owns or leases and operates 13 manufacturing facilities outside North America. The Company also leases 6 regional distribution centers in North America and several other warehouse facilities in the U.S. and international markets. Management believes the Companys owned and leased production and distribution facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently, and that the Companys properties and equipment have generally been well maintained. The Company is continually performing a supply-chain efficiency analysis, which may lead to closures of domestic and international manufacturing facilities and the redistribution of production between its remaining facilities and contract manufacturers to optimize availability and capacity and to seek to reduce operating costs.
Offices and Research and Development Facilities Since 2011, the Company has leased a facility located in Pleasanton, CA, which houses the Companys research and development group as well as other administrative and operational support personnel. The facility features state-of-the-art labs and open work spaces to encourage creativity, collaboration and innovation. The Company leases office space in Oakland, CA for its corporate headquarters. The Company owns a research and development facility located at its plant in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Company also conducts research and development activities and engineering research in leased facilities in Meriden, CT; Willowbrook, IL; Cincinnati, OH; and Durham, NC. Leased sales offices and other facilities are located at a number of other locations.
Encumbrances None of the Companys owned facilities are encumbered to secure debt owed by the Company.
18 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to routine litigation incidental to its business in the United States and in international locations, including various lawsuits and claims relating to issues such as contract disputes, product liability, patents and trademarks, advertising, commercial, administrative, employment antitrust, securities, consumer class actions and other matters. Although the results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, based on managements analysis, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for or disclosed in the Companys consolidated financial statements in Exhibit 99.1, will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Companys consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
