Page 3 Table of Contents ITEM1.
BUSINESS Overview of Business The Clorox Company (the Company or Clorox) is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer products with fiscal year 2008 net sales of $5.3 billion. The Company sells its products primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores and other retail outlets. It markets some of consumers most trusted and recognized brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products, Green Works natural cleaners, Poett  and Mistoln  cleaning products, Armor All  and STP  auto-care products, Fresh Step  and Scoop Away  cat litter, Kingsford  charcoal, Hidden Valley  and K C Masterpiece  dressings and sauces, Brita  water-filtration systems, Glad  bags, wraps and containers, and Burts Bees  natural personal care products. With approximately 8,300 employees worldwide, the Company manufactures products in more than 15 countries and markets them in more than 100 countries. The Company was founded in Oakland, Calif., in 1913 and is incorporated in Delaware.
In May 2007, the Company announced its strategy to guide it through its 100-year anniversary in 2013. The Companys Centennial Strategy is focused on creating value by investing in new and existing categories with profitable growth potential, particularly those categories aligned with global consumer trends in the areas of health and wellness, sustainability, convenience and a more multicultural marketplace. It uses economic profit, defined as the profit a company generates over and above the cost of paying for its assets used to run its business, to drive enhanced performance, portfolio choices and resource allocation. A key component of the Centennial Strategy is to accelerate sales by growing existing brands through innovation, new products and demand building initiatives, expanding into adjacent product categories, entering new sales channels, increasing distribution within existing countries and pursuing new businesses in growing markets where the Company can establish and sustain a competitive advantage.
As part of its Centennial Strategy, in November 2007, the Company acquired Burts Bees Inc., a leading manufacturer and marketer of natural personal care products. For further information on recent business developments, refer to the information set forth under the caption Executive Overview - Fiscal Year 2008 Summary in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on pages 1 through 2 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.
Page 4 Table of Contents Financial Information About Operating Segments The Company operates through two operating segments: North America and International. The North America operating segment includes all products marketed in the United States and Canada. The International operating segment includes all products marketed outside the United States and Canada. Each operating segment is individually managed with separate operating results that are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company realigned its operating segments into these two segments due to changes in its management reporting structure.
Financial information for the last three fiscal years for each of the Companys operating segments, reconciled to the consolidated results, is set forth below. Historical segment financial information presented herein has been revised to reflect the new operating segments. Corporate includes certain nonallocated administrative costs, amortization of trademarks and other intangible assets, interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other nonoperating income and expense.
(Millions) Fiscal Year North America International Corporate Total Company Net sales 2008 $ 4,440 $ 833 $  $ 5,273 2007 4,130 $ 717  4,847 2006 4,005 639  4,644 Earnings (losses) from continuing operations before income taxes 2008 $ 1,211 $ 146 $ (664 ) $ 693 2007 1,205 141 (603 ) 743 2006 1,131 129 (607 ) 653 Identifiable assets 2008 $ 3,359 $ 727 $ 622 $ 4,708 2007 2,256 716 609 3,581 2006 2,154 581 786 3,521 Principal Products The products of the North America segment include:  Laundry additives, including bleaches, under the Clorox  , Clorox 2  and Javex  brands; cleaning products, primarily under the Clorox  , Formula 409  , Liquid-Plumr  , Pine-Sol  , S.O.S  and Tilex  brands; natural cleaning products under the Green Works brand; water-filtration systems and filters under the Brita  brand; products for institutional, janitorial, healthcare and food-service markets; auto-care products, primarily under the Armor All  and STP  brands; plastic bags, wraps and containers, under the Glad  brand; cat litter products, primarily under the Fresh Step  and Scoop Away  brands; food products, primarily under the Hidden Valley  and K C Masterpiece  brands; charcoal products under the Kingsford  and Match Light  brands; and natural personal care products under the Burts Bees  brand.

The Company has two product lines that have accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated net sales during each of the past three fiscal years. In fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, sales of liquid bleach represented approximately 14%, 14% and 13% of the Companys total consolidated net sales, 11%, 12% and 11% of net sales in its North America segment and 26%, 24% and 23% of net sales in its International segment. In fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, sales of trash bags represented approximately 13%, 14% and 14% of the Companys total consolidated net sales. In fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, sales of trash bags represented approximately 15% of net sales in the North America segment and approximately 4% of net sales in the International segment.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution Most of the Companys products are nationally advertised and sold within the United States to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, dollar, military and other types of retail stores primarily through a direct sales force, and to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a combination of direct sales teams and a network of brokers. Within the United States, the Company also sells institutional, janitorial, healthcare and food-service versions of many of its products through distributors, as well as natural personal care products through the internet. Outside the United States, the Company sells products to the retail trade through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners.
Page 6 Table of Contents Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations For detailed financial information about the Companys foreign and domestic operations, including net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 22 Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 58 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto .
Sources And Availability Of Raw Materials The Company purchases raw materials, from numerous unaffiliated domestic and international suppliers, some of which are sole suppliers. Interruptions in the delivery of these materials or services could adversely impact the Company. Key raw materials used by the Company include resin, jet fuel, chlor-alkali, agricultural commodities and other raw materials. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal year 2008, although costs for certain raw materials were significantly higher than prior-year levels, continuing a trend that began during the 2005 fiscal year. The Company generally utilizes supply and forward-purchase contracts to help ensure availability and help manage the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations. However, the Company is nonetheless highly exposed to changes in the price of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 16 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto and Risk Factors  Price increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Companys profits in Item1.A.
Patents and Trademarks Most of the Companys brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks. Its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business, and the Company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements. Maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the Companys success. The Companys patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted, where appropriate, against apparent infringements.
Seasonality Most sales of the Companys charcoal briquets and, to a lesser extent, food and auto-care product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year. A significant portion of the net sales of the Companys Burts Bees  natural personal care products occurs during the months of October through March. Operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those products in the off-season.
Customers and Order Backlog In each of fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, net sales to the Companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its domestic and international affiliates, were 26% of the Companys total consolidated net sales. Order backlog is not a significant factor in the Companys business.
Competition The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. Most of the Companys products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products in certain categories. Competition is encountered from similar and alternative products, some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the Company. Depending on the product, the Companys products compete on product performance, brand recognition, price, quality or other benefits to consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising support. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvement to maintain its relative market position.
Page 7 Table of Contents Research and Development The Company conducts research and development primarily at its Technical Center in Pleasanton, Calif. and its research and development facilities in Kennesaw, Ga.; Cincinnati, Oh.; Willowbrook, Ill.; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and consumer insight research to develop consumer-preferred products with innovative and distinctive features. The Company incurred expenses of $111 million, $108 million and $99 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, on direct research activities relating to the development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of existing products. None of this research activity was customer sponsored. For further information regarding the Companys research and development costs, see Research and development costs in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 6 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Environmental Matters For information regarding noncapital expenditures related to environmental matters, see the discussions below under Risk Factors  Environmental matters create potential liability risks in Item1.A. No material capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance are presently anticipated.
Number of Persons Employed At June30, 2008, the Company employed approximately 8,300 people.

ITEM1.A.RISK FACTORS The following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Report or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Companys business operations and financial results.
The Companys operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations.
The Company cannot be certain that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of its key goals, then its actual performance could vary materially from its expectations. The Companys operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors, including the following:  significant increases in the costs of energy and transportation, including the cost of diesel, or key raw materials including but not limited to resin, chlor-alkali, agricultural commodities and other raw materials; Page 8 Table of Contents  the impact of general economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in which the Company currently does business;  consumer and customer reaction to price increases;  changes in product pricing by the Company or its competitors;  the introduction of new products and line extensions by the Company or its competitors;  the mix of products with varying profitability sold in a given quarter;  the mix of products sold within different channels and countries with varying profitability in a given quarter;  the Companys ability to control internal costs;  the effectiveness of the Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs;  the ability of the Company to execute its Centennial Strategy successfully;  the availability and cost of debt financing;  the ability of the Company to maintain and enhance profits in the face of a consolidating retail environment;  the ability of the Company to successfully implement and achieve the expected benefits of its process improvement initiatives;  the ability of the Company to achieve its business plans, including volume growth and pricing plans, as a result of high levels of competitive activity;  the ability of the Company to penetrate and grow international markets;  the ability of the Company to maintain key retail customer relationships;  the ability of the Company to generate expected cost savings and efficiencies;  the ability of the Company to maintain the value of its brands;  the ability of the Company to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, including the resolution of pending matters within current estimates;  changes to cash flow resulting from the Companys operating results, tax,settlement payments, debt repayments and share repurchases;  gains or losses in the value of the Companys investment portfolio or pension assets;  the ability of the Company to manage inventory at appropriate levels, including decisions regarding obsolescence;  the impact of any litigation or product liability claims;  fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes;  expenses for impairment and obsolescence of property, plant and equipment in excess of projections; Page 9 Table of Contents  the impact of potential emerging technologies on the Companys existing product lines, including any potential future obsolescence;  expenses for impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in excess of projections;  charges resulting from any restructuring that management may, from time to time, choose to undertake;  the ability of the Company to make up for lost revenues resulting from divestitures;  the impact of changing accounting principles and standards;  significant increases in interest rates, insurance costs, or in pension, healthcare or other employee benefit costs;  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;  the impact of environmental remediation costs, including those for which the Company is jointly and severally liable;  the impact of changes in the market value of investments, including those investments held in the Companys pension plan;  the impact of currency fluctuations; and  the impact of foreign import and export restrictions or other trade regulations.
In addition, sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth, can place burdens on management resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings. To some extent, the Company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues. If actual revenue falls short of these expectations, operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected.
Price increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Companys profits.
During fiscal year 2008, the Company experienced commodity and energy cost increases of approximately $137 million, and the Company expects greater increases in these costs in fiscal year 2009 by an estimated $180 million to $200 million. Increases in the cost of raw materials including resin, chlor-alkali, linerboard, soybean oil, solvent, natural oils and other chemicals and agricultural commodities, or increases in the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, including the cost of diesel, may harm the Companys profits and operating results. If price increases for any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases, its profits and operating results will be harmed. In addition, if the Company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, and the commodity costs decline, the Company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time.
For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 16 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.
Reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruption to the Companys business.
The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers, including sole suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies. If the Company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relations, or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for its business, or if any of the Companys suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress, the Company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected.
Page 10 Table of Contents The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
The Company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the U.S. and in its international markets. Most of the Companys products compete with other widely-advertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories, which typically are sold at lower prices. The Company also encounters competition from similar and alternative products, many of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies.
The Companys products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, price, quality or other benefits to consumers. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position.
Some of the Companys competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the Company. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company can. In addition, the Companys competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions or reduce prices and could lead to reduced profits and could adversely affect growth.
Volume growth may be difficult to achieve.
A large percentage of the Companys revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition. During fiscal year 2008, approximately 80% of the Companys net sales were generated in U.S. markets. U.S. markets for household products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration. The Companys ability to achieve volume growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation, investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors. In addition, price increases may slow volume growth or create declines in volume in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product improvements, undertake sales and demand building initiatives to grow its product categories, and develop, acquire or successfully launch new products, it may not achieve its volume growth objectives.
The Company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions.
The Companys future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions. The Company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals. The development and introduction of new products requires substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. New product development and marketing efforts have inherent risks, including product development or launch delays, which could result in the Company not being first to market, the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, and the cost of failed product introductions.
Page 11 Table of Contents Dependence on key customers could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
A limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Companys net sales. The Companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its domestic and international affiliated companies, accounted for approximately 26% of the Companys net sales during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Companys five largest customers accounted for 42%, 42% and 41% of its total consolidated net sales, respectively. The Company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Companys largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private-label or competitors products, may harm the Companys sales. In addition, the Companys business is based primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.
Failure to effectively respond to the demands of the Companys customers could have a significant impact on the Companys business.
The Companys business is dependent on the Companys ability to successfully manage relationships with its retail trade customers. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease their purchases from the Company, causing the Companys sales and profits to decline. In recent years, the Company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the U.S. and internationally. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers, who may demand lower pricing or special packaging, or impose other requirements on product suppliers. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. If a large consolidated retailer decreased their purchases from the Company due to the Companys inability to meet the retailers demands, the Companys business could be especially impacted.
The Companys financial results could suffer if the Company is unable to implement its Centennial Strategy or if the Centennial Strategy does not achieve its intended effects.
The Companys strategic plan, named the Centennial Strategy for the Companys milestone anniversary in 2013, was announced in May 2007. A key driver of the strategy is to accelerate sales by growing existing brands, expanding into adjacent product categories, entering new sales channels, increasing distribution within existing countries and pursuing new business in growing markets where the company can establish and sustain a competitive advantage.
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to implement the Centennial Strategy or achieve the intended growth targets. Any changes to the Companys portfolio, whether through the development of new products or through acquisitions, mergers or divestitures, are inherently risky and costly. The success of such changes depends on many factors, including consumer and customer acceptance of new products, the integration of any acquired companies and the deployment of proceeds from any divestitures. If we are unable to implement the Centennial Strategy in accordance with our expectations, the Companys financial results could be adversely affected. Moreover, the Company cannot be certain that successful implementation of the Centennial Strategy will necessarily advance the Companys business or financial results.
Acquisitions and new venture investments may not be successful.
In connection with the Companys Centennial Strategy, the Company may seek to increase growth through acquisitions. Not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive, but these transactions also involve numerous risks, including the ability to:  successfully integrate acquired companies, products or personnel into the Companys existing business; Page 12 Table of Contents  achieve expected synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from acquisitions;  retain key relationships with employees, customers, partners and suppliers of acquired companies; and  maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies.
Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the Companys acquisitions diminish in the future, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect its operating results.
For example, in November 2007, the Company acquired Burts Bees Inc. (BBI), a leading manufacturer and marketer of natural personal care products, for an aggregate purchase price of $913 million (excluding $25 million of associated tax benefits). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve the sales and profit growth or increased distribution in the BBI business that management has projected.
In addition, any future new venture investments may not be successful. In fiscal year 2008, the Company terminated certain new venture investments that it decided not to pursue, resulting in charges related to the write-down of such investments. For additional information, see Restructuring and asset impairment costs in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 7 and 8 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.
Operations outside the United States expose the Company to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets.
The Companys sales outside the United States were approximately 20% of net sales in fiscal year 2008, and its strategy includes expanding its international business. As of June30, 2008, the Company owned and operated 20 manufacturing facilities outside the United States. The Company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including:  economic or political instability in its international markets, particularly in Colombia and Venezuela;  difficulty in obtaining the raw materials needed to manufacture the Companys products, particularly in Venezuela;  restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and  the imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions.
These risks could have a significant impact on the Companys ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position. The Companys small volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.
Also, the Companys operations outside the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors, and potentially adverse tax consequences.
Page 13 Table of Contents The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, it is not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time.
The share exchange with Henkel KGaA (Henkel) could result in significant tax liability.
On November22, 2004, the Company completed the exchange of its ownership interest in a subsidiary for Henkels approximately 61.4million shares of the Companys common stock, which represented approximately 29% of the Companys common stock prior to the exchange. In connection with the exchange, the Company agreed to indemnify Henkel for any taxes imposed on it if the Companys actions result in a breach of the representations and warranties that the Company made in its agreement with Henkel in a manner that causes the share exchange to fail to qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section355 of the Internal Revenue Code. Henkel agreed to similar obligations. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to Henkel and to the Company would be substantial, if imposed, and the Companys indemnification obligations to Henkel are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Although certain of the taxes described above would be imposed on Henkel, the Company would, in certain circumstances, be liable for all or a portion of such taxes. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with the IRS agreeing to the tax-free treatment of the share exchange transaction. Henkel has advised the Company that the IRS has completed its audit of Henkels U.S. groups federal income tax return for the year in which the share exchange transaction took place and did not propose any adjustments to Henkels tax-free treatment of the share exchange transaction. Nonetheless, the Company cannot be certain that the share exchange will qualify for tax-free treatment to it or to Henkel since the statutes of limitations permitting IRS assessment of tax against the Company and Henkel remain open. If the Company is required to indemnify Henkel under the circumstances set forth in its agreement with Henkel, it could result in a substantial impact to the Companys financial results and liquidity.
Resolutions of tax disputes may impact the Companys earnings and cash flow.
Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. On July1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.109 . The Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by FIN 48. Changes to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, impact the Companys effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Companys effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, refer to the information set forth in Note 20 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 51 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference Additional government regulations could impose material costs.
Generally, the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and advertising of the Companys products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the Companys products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Companys product claims and advertising are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, security at certain of our facilities is regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. In addition, the Companys international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products. If the Company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product Page 14 Table of Contents demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results, particularly with respect to its charcoal business. It is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain raw material or increase costs.
Product liability claims could adversely affect the Companys sales and operating results.
The Company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products. Claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, the Companys products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use, or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances. Product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the Companys sales and operating results. In addition, if one of the Companys products is found to be defective, the Company could be required to recall it, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy.
Environmental matters create potential liability risks.
The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities. In addition, some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the Company has sent waste, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. It is possible that the Company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
At June30, 2008, the Company had a recorded liability of $20 million for its future remediation costs. One matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability. The Company is subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with another party for this matter, and the Company has agreed to be liable for 24.3% of the aggregate remediation and associated costs, other than legal fees, as it and the other party are each responsible for their own such fees. The other party in this matter reported substantial net losses for the full calendar year 2007 and the first half of calendar year 2008 and indicated that it expects substantial net losses for the remainder of calendar year 2008. If the other party with whom the Company shares joint and several liability is unable to pay its share of the response and remediation obligations, the Company would likely be responsible for such obligations. In October 2004, the Company and the other party agreed to a consent judgment with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities. Based on the current status of this matter, and with the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures, maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30-year remediation period. The most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits. Currently, the Company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation. In addition, the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy of remediation efforts, changes in remediation requirements and the timing, varying costs and alternative clean-up technologies that may become available in the future. Although it is possible that the Companys exposure may exceed the amount recorded, any amount of such additional exposures, or range of exposures, is not estimable at this time.
The Company also handles and/or transports hazardous substances, including but not limited to chlorine, at its plant sites, including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to the Companys manufacturing facilities. A release of such chemicals, whether in transit or at our facilities, due to accident or an intentional act, could result in substantial liability. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations, and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the Company for other purposes.
Page 15 Table of Contents Failure to maximize or to successfully assert the Companys intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness.
The Company relies on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual property rights. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the Companys products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties infringe the Companys intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of the Companys brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Companys brands and harm its sales. The failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.
If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, its competitiveness could be negatively impacted.
If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Companys business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. It could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the rights holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use the intellectual property rights. Either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.
The Companys substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the Company from fulfilling its obligations.
The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness. As of June30, 2008, the Company had $3.5 billion of debt. The Companys substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:  make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its cash obligations;  increase the Companys vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limit the Companys ability to fund potential acquisitions;  require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;  limit the Companys flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates;  place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the Companys indebtedness, among other things, its ability to borrow additional funds. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company.
Page 16 Table of Contents The Company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends.
The Companys ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the Companys cash flow. In addition, the Companys ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net profits (as defined by Delaware law). The Companys cash flow and net profits are often subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Companys control, and such factors may limit the Companys ability to repay indebtedness and pay cash dividends.
The Company may incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.
The Company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes, subject to compliance with the Companys existing restrictive debt covenants. As of June30, 2008, approximately $1.2 billion was available to borrow under the Companys $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify. In addition, the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible additional downgrades in the Companys credit rating.
The facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the Companys control.
Operations at the manufacturing facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. In addition, the Companys corporate headquarters and Technical Center are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, temporary loss of access to critical data, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations.
The Companys continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on third party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting, which could harm its business and financial results.
Clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions, providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with managements authorization, and providing reasonable assurance that the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Companys continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, the Company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Companys ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud.

PROPERTIES Production and Distribution Facilities The Company owns and operates 26 manufacturing facilities in North America, which primarily serve the Companys North America segment. The Company owns and operates 20 manufacturing facilities outside North America, which primarily serve the Companys International segment. The Company also leases seven regional Page 17 Table of Contents distribution centers in North America and several other warehouse facilities. Management believes the Companys production and distribution facilities, together with additional facilities owned or leased and operated by various unaffiliated finished product suppliers and distribution center service providers that serve the Company, are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the Companys properties and equipment have generally been well maintained. The Company has announced a supply chain restructuring that it expects to complete by fiscal year 2012, which involves closing certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities.
