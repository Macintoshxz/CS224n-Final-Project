PART I  ITEM l. BUSINESS  (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.  The Company (the term "Company" as used herein includes the registrant identified on the facing sheet, The Clorox Company, and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise) was originally founded in Oakland, California in 1913 as the Electro-Alkaline Company. It was reincorporated as Clorox Chemical Corporation in 1922, as Clorox Chemical Co. in 1928, and as The Clorox Company (an Ohio corporation) in 1957, when the business was acquired by The Procter & Gamble Company. The Company was fully divested by The Procter & Gamble Company in 1969 and, as an independent company, was reincorporated in 1973 in California as The Clorox Company. In 1986, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware.  For recent business developments, refer to the information set forth under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis," on pages C-2 through C-10 of Exhibit 99 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.  (b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.  The Company has three business segments: U.S Household Products and Canada, U.S. Specialty Products and International Operations. Financial information for the last three fiscal years, including net sales, earnings before income taxes, cumulative effect of                                        Page 2 3 change in accounting principle and identifiable assets, attributable to each of the Company's industry segments is set forth in Note 16 - Industry Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears on pages C-34 and C-35 of Exhibit 99 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.  (c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.  The Company's business operations, represented by the aggregate of its U.S. Household Products and Canada, U.S. Specialty Products and International Operations segments, include the production and marketing of non-durable consumer products sold primarily through grocery and other retail stores. For the most part, the factors necessary for an understanding of these three segments are essentially the same.  PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS. The U.S. Household Products and Canada segment includes the Company's household cleaning, bleach and other home care products, water filtration products marketed in the United States, and all products marketed in Canada. The U.S. Specialty Products segment includes the Company's charcoal, automotive care, cat litter, insecticide, dressings, sauces, professional products and food storage and disposal categories. Finally, the International Operations segment, which includes the Company's overseas operations (excluding Canada), exports and Puerto Rico, primarily focuses on the laundry, household cleaning, automotive care and food storage and disposal categories. Principal products, by segment, currently marketed in the United States and internationally are listed on pages 21 and 22 of the Company's Annual Report incorporated herein by reference. Each of the Company's segments accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company's consolidated revenues during the last three fiscal years, as shown in Note 16 - Industry Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears on pages C-34 and C-35 of Exhibit 99 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.  PRINCIPAL MARKETS - METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION. Most non-durable household consumer products are nationally advertised and sold within the United States to grocery stores through a network of brokers and to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, military and other retail stores primarily through a direct sales force. The Company also sells within the United States institutional versions of specialty food and non-food products. Outside the United States, the Company sells consumer products through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners.                                        Page 3 4 SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS. The Company has obtained ample supplies of all required raw materials and packaging supplies, which, with a few exceptions, were available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal year 2001. Polyethylene resin raw materials, which are particularly important for the U.S. Specialty Products segment, were available from a wide variety of sources during fiscal year 2001, and the Company has entered into financial instruments with various maturities partially to stabilize the cost of its polyethylene resin requirements. Contingency plans have been developed for any major single-sourced supplier materials.  PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS. Although some products are covered by patents, the Company does not believe that patents, patent licenses or similar arrangements are material to its business. Most of the Company's brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks. Its brand names and trademarks are extremely important to its business, and the Company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements.  SEASONALITY. The U.S. Specialty Products segment is the only portion of the operations of the Company that has any significant degree of seasonality. Most sales of the Company's charcoal briquets, insecticides, and automotive appearance product lines occur in the first six months of each calendar year. Working capital to carry inventories built up in the off-season and to extend terms to customers is generally provided by internally-generated funds plus commercial paper lines of credit.  CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG. During fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, revenues from the Company's sales of its products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliated companies were 20%, 19% and 19%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales. Except for this relationship, the Company is not dependent upon any other single customer or a small group of customers. Order backlog is not a significant factor in the Company's business.  RENEGOTIATION. None of the Company's operations is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of the federal government.  COMPETITION. The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. Most of the Company's products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each                                        Page 4 5 category and with "private label" brands and "generic" non-branded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives. Competition is encountered from similar and alternative products, many of which are produced and marketed by major national concerns having financial resources greater than those of the Company. Depending on the competitive product, the Company's products compete on price, quality or other benefits to consumers.  A newly-introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising and sales promotion. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continuing advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Company incurred expenses of approximately $67 million, $63 million and $63 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, on research activities relating to the development of new products or the maintenance and improvement of existing products. None of this research activity was customer-sponsored.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Historically, the Company has not made material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or to comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, in general, the Company does anticipate spending increasing amounts annually for facility upgrades and for environmental programs. The amount of capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in fiscal year 2001 and is not expected to be material in the next fiscal year.  The Company is involved in certain other environmental matters, including Superfund clean-up efforts at various locations. The potential cost to the Company related to ongoing environmental matters is uncertain due to such factors as: the unknown magnitude of possible pollution and clean-up costs; the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and their interpretations; and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative clean-up technologies. Based on its experience and without offsetting for expected insurance recoveries or discounting for present value, the Company does not expect that such costs individually and in the aggregate will represent a material cost to the Company or affect its competitive position.  NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED. At the end of fiscal year 2001, approximately 11,000 people were employed by the Company.                                        Page 5 6 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS. Except for historical information, matters discussed in this Form 10-K, including the Management's Discussion and Analysis and statements about future growth, are forward-looking statements based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections. In addition, from time to time, the Company may make forward-looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance, business prospects, new products, research and development activities, plans for international expansion, acquisitions, and similar matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the Company's actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are uncertain. The risks and uncertainties that may affect operations, performance, product development, and results of the Company's business, some of which may be beyond the control of the Company, include those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, marketplace conditions and events, and the following:  OPERATING RESULTS MAY NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS. The Company cannot be sure that its operating results will meet its expectations. The Company's operating results will be influenced by a number of factors, including the following:  *  the introduction of new products and line extensions by the Company or its    competitors;  *  the mix of products sold in a given quarter;  *  the Company's ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw    materials;  *  significant increases in energy costs;  *  changes in product pricing policies by the Company or its competitors;  *  changes in accounting policies; or  *  the impact of general economic conditions in the United States and in other    countries in which the Company currently does business.  In addition, sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth, can place burdens on the Company's management resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on operating results. To some extent, the Company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues. If actual revenue falls short of these expectations, operating results are likely to be adversely affected.                                        Page 6 7 FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT ERP SYSTEM COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ORDER PROCESSING. The Company is in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning system software. This software is designed to improve internal systems and processes, including order fulfillment. If the Company fails to successfully implement the software, its order fulfillment process, and therefore its ability to take, ship, bill for and collect for orders, could be adversely impacted.  OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO UNCERTAIN CONDITIONS IN OVERSEAS MARKETS. The Company believes that its sales outside the United States, which were 19% of net sales in fiscal year 2001, are likely to increase as a percentage of its total sales. As a result, the Company will increasingly face risks associated with having foreign operations, including:  *  economic or political instability in its overseas markets; and  *  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may make the Company's    products more expensive in its foreign markets or negatively impact its sales    or earnings.  All of these risks could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to sell its products on a timely and competitive basis in foreign markets and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company seeks to limit its foreign currency exchange risks through the use of foreign currency forward contracts when practical, but cannot be sure that this strategy will be successful. In addition, the Company's operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, credit risk of local customers and distributors, and potentially adverse tax consequences.  INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. One of the Company's strategies is to increase its sales volumes, earnings and the markets it serves through the acquisition of, or merger with, other businesses in the United States and internationally. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions or mergers into its operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that companies or operations acquired will be profitable at the time of their acquisition or will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investment made.  DISPOSITION OF NON-STRATEGIC BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.                                        Page 7 8 The Company engages in ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses. If it decides that a business no longer supports the Company's strategic direction, the Company may attempt to sell that business. There can be no assurance that any such disposition will occur, that, if it occurs, it will be at a price sufficient to recover the book value of the business disposed of or that the proceeds will be sufficient to avoid earnings dilution.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON CONTINUOUS AND SUCCESSFUL NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. In most categories in which the Company competes, there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions. An important factor in the Company's future performance will be its ability to identify emerging consumer and technological trends and to maintain and improve the competitiveness of its products. The Company cannot be sure that it will successfully achieve those goals. Continued product development and marketing efforts have all the risks inherent in the development of new products and line extensions, including development delays, the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, and the cost of failed product introductions.  GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD IMPOSE MATERIAL COSTS. The manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution and labeling of the Company's products and the Company's business operations generally all must comply with extensive federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the Company's products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. The failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, including taxes, could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the Company from introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS CREATE POTENTIAL LIABILITY RISKS. The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company has                                        Page 8 9 incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with those laws and regulations in the United States and internationally. The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its presently and formerly owned and leased facilities. In addition, some of the Company's present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years, and over that time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which the Company has sent waste, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. It is possible that the Company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.  FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVENESS. The Company relies on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property. The Company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, laws of some of the foreign countries in which the Company's products are or may be sold do not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure of the Company to protect its proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against the Company could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.  (d)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS.  The following table shows net sales and assets by geographic area for the last three fiscal years:  Net Sales By Geographic Area: (Millions)                                 2001            2000            1999 ----------                                ------          ------          ------ Foreign                                   $  734          $  767          $  737 United States                             $3,169          $3,222          $3,149 Assets at June 30: (Millions)                                 2001            2000            1999 ----------                                ------          ------          ------ Foreign                                   $1,134          $1,201          $1,091 United States                             $2,861          $3,152          $3,041 Page 9 10 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES  PRODUCTION FACILITIES. The Company operates production and major warehouse facilities for its operations in 29 locations throughout the United States and in 30 locations internationally. Most of the space is owned. Warehousing space is leased from public service warehouses around the United States. The Company also utilizes six domestic regional distribution centers for many of the Company's products, which are operated by service providers. The Company closed its manufacturing facility in Akron, Ohio in fiscal year 2001 in connection with its sale of the fire logs business and has announced plans to close its manufacturing facilities in Wrens, Georgia and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada during fiscal year 2002. The Company considers its manufacturing and warehousing facilities to be adequate to support its business.  OFFICES AND R&D FACILITIES. The Company owns its general office building located in Oakland, California. The Company also owns its Technical Center and Data Center located in Pleasanton, California. The Company leases its research and development center and its engineering research facility for Glad and GladWare products, which are located in Willowbrook, Illinois, and Kennesauw, Georgia, respectively. The Company also leases its research and development center for STP products located in Brookfield, Connecticut. Leased sales and other office facilities are located at a number of other locations.  ENCUMBRANCES. None of the Company's owned facilities are encumbered to secure debt owed by the Company, except that the manufacturing facility in Belle, Missouri, secures industrial revenue bond indebtedness incurred in relation to the construction and upgrade thereof.
