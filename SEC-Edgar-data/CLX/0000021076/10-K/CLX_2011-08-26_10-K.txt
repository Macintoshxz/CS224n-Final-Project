4 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview of Business The Company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer and institutional products with approximately 8,300 employees worldwide and fiscal year 2010 net sales of $5.5 billion. The Company sells its products primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores and other retail outlets. It markets some of consumers most trusted and recognized brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products, Green Works  natural cleaning and laundry products, Poett  and Mistoln  cleaning products, Armor All  and STP  auto-care products, Fresh Step  and Scoop Away  cat litter, Kingsford  charcoal, Hidden Valley  and K C Masterpiece  dressings and sauces, Brita  water-filtration systems, Glad  bags, wraps and containers, and Burts Bees  natural personal care products. The Companys products are manufactured in more than two dozen countries and sold in more than 100 countries. The Company was founded in Oakland, Calif., in 1913 and is incorporated in Delaware.
The Company has developed a strategy focused on creating value by investing in new and existing sales channels, countries with profitable growth potential and categories, particularly those categories aligned with global consumer trends in the areas of health and wellness, sustainability and affordability, and appealing to a multicultural marketplace. The Company uses economic profit to drive enhanced performance, portfolio choices and resource allocation. Economic profit represents profit generated over and above the cost of capital used by the business to generate that profit. For information on recent business developments, refer to the information set forth under the caption Executive Overview - Fiscal Year 2010 Summary in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 3 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.
Financial Information About Operating Segments and Principal Products The Company operates through strategic business units that are aggregated into four reportable segments: Cleaning, Lifestyle, Household and International. The four reportable segments consist of the following: Cleaning consists of   laundry, home-care, professional products and auto-care products marketed and   sold in the United States. Products within this segment include laundry   additives, including bleaches under the Clorox  brand and Clorox 2  stain fighter and color booster;   home-care products, primarily under the Clorox  , Formula 409  , Liquid-Plumr  , Pine-Sol  , S.O.S  and Tilex  brands; natural cleaning and   laundry products under the Green Works  brand; and auto-care products   primarily under the Armor All  and STP  brands.
Household consists of   charcoal, cat litter and plastic bags, wraps and container products marketed   and sold in the United States. Products within this segment include plastic   bags, wraps and containers, under the Glad  brand; cat litter products, under   the Fresh Step  , Scoop Away  and Ever Clean  brands; and charcoal products   under the Kingsford  and Match Light  brands.
Lifestyle consists of   food products, water-filtration systems and filters marketed and sold in the   United States and all natural personal care products. Products within this   segment include dressings and sauces, primarily under the Hidden Valley  and K C   Masterpiece  brands; water-filtration systems and filters under the Brita  brand; and all   natural personal care products under the Burts Bees  brand.
International consists   of products sold outside the United States, excluding natural personal care   products. These products include home-care, laundry, auto-care, water   filtration, charcoal and cat litter products, dressings and sauces, plastic   bags, wraps and containers, and insecticides, primarily under the Clorox  , Javex  , Glad  , PinoLuz  , Ayudin  , Limpido  , Clorinda  , Poett  , Mistolin  , Lestoil  , Bon Bril  , Nevex  , Brita  , Armor All  , STP  , Green Works  , Sabra  , Pine-Sol  , Agua Jane  , Ever Clean  , Chux  , Kingsford  and Hidden Valley  brands.
5 The Company is exploring strategic options to optimize value of its auto-care products business. Those options could include a sale of that business or could involve retaining the business in its current configuration , although no decisions have been made at this time .
The Company has three product lines that have accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated net sales during each of the past three fiscal years. In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, sales of liquid bleach represented approximately 13%, 13% and 14% of the Companys total consolidated net sales, 25% of net sales in the Cleaning segment for each of the three fiscal years and 21%, 25% and 23% of net sales in the International segment. In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, sales of trash bags represented approximately 11%, 12% and 13% of the Companys total consolidated net sales, approximately 31%, 33% and 34% of net sales in the Household segment and approximately 10%, 10% and 11% of net sales in the International segment. Sales of charcoal represented approximately 11% in fiscal year 2010 and approximately 10% in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively, of the Companys total consolidated net sales and approximately 36%, 32% and 30% of net sales in the Household segment, respectively.
Information for the last three fiscal years about the results of each of the Companys reportable segments and identifiable assets as of the end of the last two fiscal years, reconciled to the consolidated results, are set forth below.
Fiscal Total ( Millions ) Year Cleaning Household Lifestyle International Corporate (1) Company Net sales 2010 $ 1,838 $ 1,663 $ 864 $ 1,169 $ - $ 5,534 2009 1,836 1,726 813 1,075 - 5,450 2008 1,817 1,698 676 1,082 - 5,273 Earnings (losses)     before income taxes 2010 440 290 303 172 (280 ) 925 2009 410 289 270 140 (298 ) 811 2008 360 225 205 177 (274 ) 693 Identifiable assets 2010 1,211 788 1,378 907 271 4,555 2009 1,043 724 1,316 895 598 4,576 (1) Corporate includes certain nonallocated administrative costs,       interest income, interest expense and certain other nonoperating income       and expenses. Corporate assets include cash and cash equivalents, the       Companys headquarters and research and development facilities,       information systems hardware and software, pension balances, and other       investments.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution Most of the Companys products are nationally advertised and sold within the United States to mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, and dollar, military and other types of retail stores primarily through a direct sales force, and to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a combination of direct sales teams and a network of brokers. Within the United States, the Company also sells institutional, janitorial, healthcare and food-service versions of many of its products through distributors, as well as natural personal care products through the internet. Outside the United States, the Company sells products to the retail trade through subsidiaries, licensees, distributors and joint-venture arrangements with local partners.
Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations For detailed financial information about the Companys foreign and domestic operations, including net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 21 Segment Reporting of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 65 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
6 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials The Company purchases raw material from numerous unaffiliated domestic and international suppliers, some of which are sole-source or single-source suppliers. Interruptions in the delivery of these materials or services could adversely impact the Company. Key raw materials used by the Company include resin, jet fuel, chlor-alkali, sodium hypochlorite, corrugate, agricultural commodities and other raw materials. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal year 2010 and costs for materials continue to be volatile. During the first half of fiscal year 2010, the Company experienced moderate decline in commodity costs, and during the second half of fiscal year 2010, the Company experienced moderate commodity cost increases. The Company generally utilizes supply and forward-purchase contracts to help ensure availability and help manage the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations. However, the Company is nonetheless highly exposed over the short term to changes in the price of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page20 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto and Risk Factors  Price increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Companys profits in Item 1.A.
Patents and Trademarks Most of the Companys brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks. Its brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business, and the Company pursues a course of vigorous action against apparent infringements. Maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the Companys success. The Companys patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted, where appropriate, against apparent infringements.
Seasonality Most sales of the Companys charcoal products occur in the first six months of each calendar year. A moderate seasonality trend also occurs in the net sales of the Companys Burts Bees  natural personal care products, with slightly more than half of the annual net sales occurring during the months of October through March. Operating cash flow is used to build inventories of those products in the off-season.
Customers and Order Backlog Net sales to the Companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 27% for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and 26% for fiscal year 2008, of the Companys total consolidated net sales. Order backlog is not a significant factor in the Companys business.
Competition The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. Most of the Companys products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products in certain categories. Competition is encountered from similar and alternative products, some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the Company. Depending on the product, the Companys products compete on product performance, brand recognition, price, value or other benefits to consumers. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising support. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvement to maintain its relative market position.
7 Research and Development The Company conducts research and development primarily at its Technical Center in Pleasanton, Calif. and also conducts research and development activities in Kennesaw, Ga.; Cincinnati, Oh.; Willowbrook, Il.; Midland, Mi.; Durham, NC; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and consumer insight research to develop consumer-preferred products with innovative and distinctive features. The Company incurred expenses of $119 million, $114 million, and $111 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on direct research activities relating to the development of new products and/or the maintenance and improvement of existing products. In addition, the Company also obtains technologies for use in its products from third parties. Royalties relating to such technologies are reflected in the Companys cost of sales. For further information regarding the Companys research and development costs, see Research and development costs in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page7 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Environmental Matters For information regarding noncapital expenditures related to environmental matters, see the discussions below under Risk Factors  Environmental matters create potential liability risks in Item 1.A. No material capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance are presently anticipated.
Number of Persons Employed At June 30, 2010, the Company employed approximately 8,300 people.

8 ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Report or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Companys business operations and financial results. Risks include: significant increases in   the costs of energy and transportation, including the cost of diesel, or of   key raw materials, including, but not limited to, resin, chlor-alkali, sodium   hypochlorite, corrugate, agricultural commodities and other raw   materials; the Companys ability to   control internal costs and generate expected cost savings and   efficiencies; the ability of the   Company to efficiently manage its supply chain and manufacturing process and   to effectively provide supply assurances to its customers; the impact of a   potential product withdrawal, recall or other quality issue; the ability of the   Company to successfully execute its strategies; the ability of the   Company to penetrate and grow international markets; the ability of the   Company to achieve its business plans, including volume growth and pricing   plans, as a result of high levels of competitive activity or other   factors; fluctuations in federal,   state, local and foreign taxes and the ability of the Company to successfully   manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, including the resolution of pending   matters within current estimates; the ability of the   Company to ensure compliance with applicable laws and with the Companys   policies and procedures; the impact of any   litigation or product liability claims; the impact of   environmental remediation costs, including those for which the Company is   jointly and severally liable; the introduction of new   products and line extensions by the Company or its   competitors; the effectiveness of the   Companys advertising, marketing and promotional programs, including the   effectiveness of the Companys use of digital media to reach   consumers; the ability of the   Company to maintain key retail customer relationships; changes in product   pricing by the Company or its competitors and consumer and customer reaction   to such changes; the impact of customer   inventory reductions or reduction in the number of brands offered on retailer   shelves; the impact of potential   emerging technologies on the Companys existing product lines, including any   potential future obsolescence; the mix of products sold   within different channels and countries with varying profitability in a given   quarter or fiscal year; 9 the ability of the   Company to manage inventory at appropriate levels, including decisions   regarding obsolescence; the ability of the   Company to maintain and enhance profits in the face of a consolidating retail   environment; the ability to attract   and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet the Companys   business needs; the impact of general   economic conditions in the United States and in other countries in which the   Company currently does business; the impact of interest   rate and currency fluctuations; the impact of   fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments and the ability to achieve   hedge effectiveness for accounting purposes; the impact of foreign   import and export restrictions or other trade regulations; the availability and   cost of debt financing; changes to cash flow   resulting from the Companys operating results, tax settlement payments, debt   repayments and share repurchases; charges resulting from   any restructuring that management may, from time to time, choose to   undertake; charges for impairment   and obsolescence of property, plant and equipment in excess of   projections; expenses for impairment   of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and equity investments in   excess of projections; the impact of changing   accounting principles and standards; significant increases in   insurance costs, or pension, healthcare or other employee benefit   costs; the impact of changes in   the market value of investments, including those investments held in the   Companys pension plan, and any resulting funding requirements;   and the ability of the   Company to maintain the value and reputation of its brands.
In addition, Company growth, whether due to acquisitions or to internal growth, can burden management resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on operating results and net earnings. To some extent, the Company sets its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues. If actual revenue falls short of these expectations, operating results and net earnings are likely to be adversely affected.
10 The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
The Company faces intense competition from consumer product companies both in the U.S. and in its international markets. Most of the Companys products compete with other widely-advertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic nonbranded products of grocery chains and wholesale cooperatives in certain categories, which typically are sold at lower prices.
The Companys products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, price, value or other benefits to consumers. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position.
Some of the Companys competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the Company. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company can. In addition, the Companys competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions and/or reduce prices and could lead to reduced profits and could adversely affect growth.
Unfavorable general economic conditions and financial market volatility may negatively impact the Companys financial performance and liquidity.
Although the Company continues to devote significant resources to support its brands, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect consumer demand for the Companys products. Consumers may reduce discretionary spending due to economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, and this may lead to reduced sales volumes or cause a shift in the Companys product mix from higher margin to lower margin products. Consumers may increase purchases of lower-priced or non-branded products and the Companys competitors may increase levels of promotional activity for lower-priced products as they seek to maintain sales volumes during recessionary periods.
11 In addition, global markets have continued to experience significant disruptions during fiscal year 2010 and continuing volatility could harm the Companys business. Although the Company currently generates significant cash flows from ongoing operations and has access to global credit markets through its financing activities and existing credit facilities, if the current credit conditions were to worsen, the Company might not be able to access credit markets on favorable terms, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to borrow. Financial market volatility and unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of the Companys customers, suppliers and other business partners. If customers financial conditions are severely affected, the Company may not be able to collect account receivables. In addition, the decline in the equity markets and the valuation of other assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system disruptions has affected the value of the Companys pension plan assets. The lower pension plan asset base has negatively affected the return on plan assets and has increased the Companys pension expense. As a result, the Company has contributed additional pension funding. If current market conditions worsen or continue for a prolonged period of time, it could have an additional negative impact on future pension expense and cash flow.
Sales growth may be difficult to achieve.
A large percentage of the Companys revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to increased competition. During fiscal year 2010, approximately 80% of the Companys net sales were generated in U.S. markets. U.S. markets for cleaning products are considered mature and are generally characterized by high household penetration. The Companys ability to achieve sales growth will depend on its ability to drive growth through innovation, investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from competitors. In addition, price increases may slow sales growth or create declines in sales in the short term as consumers adjust to price increases. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product improvements, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that grow its product categories, and develop, acquire or successfully launch new products, it may not achieve its sales growth objectives.
The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate risk and uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these hedges only offset a small portion of the Companys exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and its reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
In addition to foreign exchange rate risks, the Company faces and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic or political   instability in its international markets, particularly in Latin America and   particularly in Venezuela; difficulty in obtaining   non-local currency (e.g. U.S. dollars, Euros) to pay for the raw materials   needed to manufacture the Companys products and contract-manufactured   products, particularly in Venezuela; restrictions on or costs   relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States,   including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations;   and the imposition of   tariffs, trade restrictions, price restrictions or other governmental actions   generating a negative impact on our business.
These risks could have a significant impact on the Companys ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position. The Companys small sales volume in some countries, relative to some multinational and local competitors, could exacerbate such risks.
12 Also, the Companys operations outside the United States are subject to risks relating to potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, import and export laws, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.
For further information regarding the impact of currency exchange rates and uncertain conditions in international markets, see Venezuela in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 14 through 16 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Operations outside of the United States may be affected by legal and regulatory risks, and government reviews, inquiries or investigations could harm the Companys business.
The Companys operations outside the United States are subject to risks relating to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in the United States and in local jurisdictions. Additionally, there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls. From time to time, the Company may conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to ensure that the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, the Company could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Companys operations or activities are not in compliance with United States laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or various international laws and regulations could expose the Company to significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may harm the business and reputation of the Company.
Acquisitions, new venture investments and divestitures may not be successful.
In connection with the Companys strategy, the Company may seek to increase growth through acquisitions. Not only is the identification of good acquisition candidates difficult and competitive, but these transactions also involve numerous risks, including the ability to: successfully integrate   acquired companies, products, systems or personnel into the Companys existing   business, especially with respect to businesses or operations that are outside   of the United States; minimize any potential   interruption to the ongoing business of the Company; successfully enter   categories and markets in which the Company may have limited or no prior   experience; achieve expected   synergies and obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from   acquisitions; retain key relationships   with employees, customers, partners and suppliers of acquired companies;   and maintain uniform   standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired   companies.
13 Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, the increase in expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Future acquisitions of foreign companies would increase the Companys exposure to foreign exchange risks. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the Companys acquisitions diminish in the future, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect its operating results.
The Company may also decide to divest certain assets, businesses or brands that do not meet the Companys strategic objectives or growth targets. With respect to any divestiture, the Company may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms. Any divestiture could affect the profitability of the Company, either as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability subsequent to any divestiture. The Company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as the result of a divesture.
Any potential future acquisitions, new ventures or divestitures may divert the attention of management and may divert resources from matters that are core or critical to the business.
The Company may not successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions.
The Companys future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and line extensions and product improvements. The Company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals. The development and introduction of new products require substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. New product development and marketing efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include product development or launch delays, which could result in the Company not being first to market, the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance and the cost of failed product introductions.
Dependence on key customers could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
A limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Companys net sales. Net sales to the Companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 27% for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and 26% for fiscal year 2008 of consolidated net sales and occurred in each of the Companys reportable segments. No other customers exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in any of these years. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Companys five largest customers accounted for 45%, 43% and 42% of its net sales, respectively. The Company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Companys largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private-label or competitors products, may harm the Companys sales. Additionally, this may reduce the ability of the Company to bring new innovative products to consumers.
In addition, the Companys business is based primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease their purchases from the Company, causing the Companys sales and profits to decline. In recent years, the Company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the U.S. and internationally. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailers, which may demand lower pricing or special packaging, or impose other requirements on product suppliers. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. If the Company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.
14 The Companys financial results could suffer if the Company is unable to implement its strategies or if the Companys strategies do not achieve the intended effects.
There is no assurance that the Company will be able to implement its strategies or will achieve its intended growth targets. If the Company is unable to implement its strategies in accordance with its expectations, the Companys financial results could be adversely affected. Moreover, the Company cannot be certain that implementation of its strategies will necessarily advance the Companys business or financial results.
Profitability could suffer if the Company is unable to generate anticipated savings and efficiencies, including through its supply chain restructuring and other restructuring plans.
The Companys success and profitability depend on the efficient manufacture and production of products. Historically, the Company has undertaken restructuring programs and incurred restructuring charges, and expects to continue to restructure its operations as necessary to improve operational efficiency. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2008, the Company began a supply chain restructuring involving closing certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and redistributing production between the remaining facilities and third-party producers to optimize available capacity and reduce operating costs. Gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time and any failure to successfully execute such changes may result in supply chain interruption, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. In addition, one of the Companys key strategies is to reduce waste, lower costs and increase productivity. The Company sets aggressive annual cost savings targets in support of this strategy. Failure to reduce costs through productivity gains and operating model efficiencies could adversely affect profitability.
Price increases in raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm the Companys profits.
Increases in the cost of raw materials, including resin, chlor-alkali, sodium hypochlorite, linerboard, soybean oil, solvent, natural oils, corrugate and other chemicals and agricultural commodities, or increases in the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, including the cost of diesel, may harm the Companys profits and operating results. If price increases for any of the primary raw materials or other necessary supplies or services occur and the Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such price increases, its profits and operating results will be harmed. In addition, if the Company increases the prices of its products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, and the commodity costs decline, the Company may not be able to sustain its price increases over time. Also, competitors may not adjust their prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume, and while the Company seeks to project tradeoffs between price increases and volume, its projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases.
For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 20 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruption to the Companys business.
The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers, including sole-source and single-source suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies. If the Company is unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, or if it is unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for its business, or if any of the Companys key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress, the Company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected.
15 Additional government regulations could impose material costs.
Generally, the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution and advertising of the Companys products and the conduct of its business operations must all comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. For example, in the United States, many of the Companys products are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Companys product claims and advertising are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, security at certain of the Companys facilities is regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. Most states have agencies that regulate in parallel to these federal agencies. In addition, the Companys international operations are subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures or distributes its products. If the Company is found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results, particularly with respect to its charcoal business. It is possible that the federal government will increase regulation of the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact the Companys ability to obtain raw materials or could increase costs. In addition, pending legislative initiatives and newly adopted legislation, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the areas of healthcare reform and other initiatives and legislation in the area of taxation of foreign profits, executive compensation and corporate governance could also increase the Company's costs.
Product liability claims could adversely affect the Companys sales and operating results.
The Company may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by its products. Claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, the Companys products contain contaminants or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use, or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances or damage property. Product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the Companys sales and operating results. In addition, if one of the Companys products is found to be defective, the Company could be required to recall it, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or certain product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy.
Environmental matters create potential liability risks.
The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to air emissions, water discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. The Company is currently involved in or has potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its currently and formerly owned and leased facilities. In addition, some of its present and former facilities have been or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom the Company has sent waste, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. It is possible that the Company could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
16 At June 30, 2010, the Company had a recorded liability of $16 million for its future remediation costs. One matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounts for a substantial majority of the recorded liability. The Company is subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with Ford Motor Co. (Ford) for this matter, under which the Company has agreed to be liable for 24.3% of the aggregate remediation and associated costs, other than legal fees, as it and Ford are each responsible for their own such fees. In October 2004, the Company and Ford agreed to a consent judgment with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which sets forth certain remediation goals and monitoring activities. Based on the current status of this matter, and with the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its best estimate of its share of costs associated with the capital expenditures, maintenance and other costs to be incurred over an estimated 30-year remediation period. The most significant components of the liability relate to the estimated costs associated with the remediation of groundwater contamination and excess levels of subterranean methane deposits. The Company made payments of less than $1 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, towards remediation efforts. Currently, the Company cannot accurately predict the timing of the payments that will likely be made under this estimated obligation. In addition, the estimated loss exposure is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy of remediation efforts, changes in remediation requirements and the timing, varying costs and alternative clean-up technologies that may become available in the future. Although it is possible that the Companys exposure may exceed the amount recorded, any amount of such additional exposures, or range of exposures, is not estimable at this time.
The Company also handles and/or transports hazardous substances, including but not limited to chlorine, at its plant sites, including the rail transit of liquid chlorine from its point of origin to the Companys manufacturing facilities. A release of such chemicals, whether in transit or at the Companys facilities, due to accident or an intentional act, could result in substantial liability. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations and in providing physical security for its worldwide operations, and such expenditures reduce the cash flow available to the Company for other purposes.
Failure to maximize, successfully assert or successfully defend the Companys intellectual property rights could impact its competitiveness.
The Company relies on intellectual property rights based on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its brands, its products and the packaging for those products. The Company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights, or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the Companys products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties infringe the Companys intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of the Companys brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Companys brands and harm its sales. The failure to perfect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.
If the Company is found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or cannot obtain necessary intellectual property rights from others, its competitiveness could be negatively impacted.
If the Company is found to have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, such a finding could result in the need to cease use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Companys business and the obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. In some instances, the Company may not be able to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions or on-going sales. It could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future for rights if holders are willing to permit the Company to continue to use the intellectual property rights. Either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.
17 The Companys substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent the Company from fulfilling its obligations.
The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness. As of June 30, 2010, the Company had $2.8 billion of debt. The Companys substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could: make it more difficult   for the Company to satisfy its cash obligations; increase the Companys   vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry   conditions; limit the Companys   ability to fund potential acquisitions; require the Company to   dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on   its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund   working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate   purposes; limit the Companys   flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the   industry in which it operates; place the Company at a   competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;   and limit, along with the   financial and other restrictive covenants in the Companys indebtedness, among   other things, its ability to borrow additional funds. Failure to comply with   these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or   waived, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company.
The Company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and pay cash dividends.
The Companys ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends on the Companys cash flow. In addition, the Companys ability to pay cash dividends depends on cash flow and net profits (as defined by Delaware law). The Companys cash flow and net profits are often subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Companys control, and such factors may limit the Companys ability to repay indebtedness and pay cash dividends.
The Company may incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.
The Company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes, subject to compliance with the Companys existing restrictive debt covenants. As of June 30, 2010, the Company could add approximately $1.3 billion in incremental debt and remain in compliance with restrictive debt covenants. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify. In addition, the cost of incurring additional debt could increase due to possible downgrades in the Companys credit rating.
The facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption by events beyond the Companys control.
Operations at the facilities of the Company and its suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. In addition, the Companys corporate headquarters and Technical Center are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, temporary loss of access to critical data, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations.
18 The Companys continued growth and expansion and increasing reliance on third party service providers could adversely affect its internal control over financial reporting, which could harm its business and financial results.
Clorox management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Companys continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets will place significant additional pressure on the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, the Company increasingly engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which inserts additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Companys ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis or to detect and prevent fraud.
A failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the Companys ability to conduct business.
The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to communicating within the Company and with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements and other processes involved in managing the business. The Company is implementing enterprise-wide upgrades to the Companys hardware, software and operating systems, including initiating an international enterprise resource planning system (ERP), in order to support the Companys existing operations and future growth. If the Companys existing and/or future technology systems and processes do not adequately support the future growth of the Companys business, the Companys business may be adversely impacted. Although the Company has network security measures in place, the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches, and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users. While the Company has business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches or other similar events, and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in the ability to manage or conduct business, which may adversely impact the Companys business.
Harm to the Companys reputation or the reputation of one or more of its leading brands could have an adverse effect on the business.
Maintaining a strong reputation with consumers, customers and trade partners is critical to the success of the Companys business. The Company devotes significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve the Companys reputation and the reputation of its brands. These programs include ethics and compliance, sustainability, and product safety and quality initiatives, among others. Despite these efforts, adverse publicity about the Company, including product safety or quality or similar concerns, whether real or perceived, could harm the Companys image and result in an adverse effect on its business, as well as require resources to rebuild its reputation.
19 Resolutions of tax disputes may impact the Companys earnings and cash flow.
Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. On July 1, 2007, the Company adopted an accounting standard that provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the applicable accounting standards. Changes to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, impact the Companys effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Companys effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, refer to the information set forth in Note 19 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 56 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
ITEM 1.B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Production and Distribution Facilities The Company owns or leases and operates 23 manufacturing facilities in North America and owns and operates 18 manufacturing facilities outside North America. The Company also leases six regional distribution centers in North America and several other warehouse facilities. Management believes the Companys production and distribution facilities, together with additional facilities owned or leased and operated by various unaffiliated finished product suppliers and distribution center service providers that serve the Company, are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the Companys properties and equipment have generally been well maintained. The Company is performing a supply chain restructuring that it expects to complete by the end of fiscal year 2012, which involves closing certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and redistributing production between its remaining facilities and contract manufacturers to optimize availability, capacity and reduce operating costs. For additional information, see Restructuring and asset impairment costs in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages8 through9 of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, incorporated herein by reference.
Offices and Research and Development Facilities The Company owns its general office building located in Oakland, Calif., its Technical Center and Data Center located in Pleasanton, Calif. and its research and development facility at its plant in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Company also conducts research and development activities and engineering research in leased facilities in Willowbrook, Il.; Cincinnati, Oh.; Midland, Mi.; Durham, NC.; and Kennesaw, Ga. Leased sales and other facilities are located at a number of other locations. The Company has outsourced a significant portion of its information technology activities to Hewlett-Packard, including its data centers, which are primarily located in Alpharetta, Ga.
Encumbrances None of the Companys owned facilities are encumbered to secure debt owed by the Company.
20 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims relating to issues such as contract disputes, product liability, patents and trademarks, advertising, employee and other matters. Although the results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Companys consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
ITEM 4.
