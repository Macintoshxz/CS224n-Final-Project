1 PARTI ITEM 1.
BUSINESS Company Overview Analog Devices, Inc. (we, Analog Devices or the Company) is a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of solutions that leverage high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technology, including integrated circuits (ICs), algorithms, software, and subsystems. Since our inception in 1965, we have focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with signal processing in virtually all types of electronic equipment. Our signal processing products play a fundamental role in converting, conditioning, and processing real-world phenomena such as temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed and motion into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic devices. As new generations of applications, such as the Internet of Things, evolve, new needs for high-performance analog signal processing and digital signal processing (DSP) technology are generated. We focus on sensing, measurement, and connectivity challenges that apply to a diverse set of customers and markets.  We combine data converters, amplifiers and linear products, radio frequency (RF) ICs, power management products, sensors based on micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) technology and other sensors, and processing products, including DSP, micro controllers and other processors, into technology platforms that we adapt to specific customer and market needs, leveraging our engineering investment across a broad base of customers.
We focus on key strategic markets where our signal processing technology is often a critical differentiator in our customers products, in particular, the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications markets. Used by over 100,000 customers worldwide, our products are embedded inside many different types of electronic equipment including: Industrial process control systems Medical imaging equipment Factory automation systems Patient monitoring devices Instrumentation and measurement systems Wireless infrastructure equipment Energy management systems Networking equipment Aerospace and defense electronics Optical systems Automobiles Portable electronic devices We were incorporated in Massachusetts in 1965. Our headquarters are near Boston, in Norwood, Massachusetts. In addition, we have manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, Ireland, and the Philippines, and have more than thirty design facilities worldwide. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADI and is included in the Standard& Poors 500 Index.

Industry Background Semiconductor components are the electronic building blocks used in electronic systems and equipment. These components are classified as either discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or ICs, in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs may be divided into two general categories, digital and analog. Digital circuits, such as memory devices and microprocessors, generally process on-off electrical signals, represented by binary digits, 1 and 0. In contrast, analog ICs monitor, condition, amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties, such as temperature, pressure, weight, light, sound or motion, and play an important role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of electronic systems. Analog ICs also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems.
2 Organizational Structure We are organized in two business groups: the Industrial and Healthcare Business Group and the Communications and Automotive Business Group. These two groups align our technology offerings with the predominant markets served in order to facilitate decision making throughout our organization. The Industrial and Healthcare Business Group is responsible for the industrial, healthcare and consumer markets and the precision converters, high-performance linear and sensor technology areas. The Communications and Automotive Business Group is responsible for the communications infrastructure and automotive electronics markets, as well as the radio frequency/microwave, high-speed converters and digital signal processing technology areas. Our sales and marketing operations are integrated within these groups and are chartered with unifying the customer experience across direct, distribution, and digital channels. Manufacturing, finance, legal, and human resources are managed as separate functional operations providing support across the Company.
Principal Products We design, manufacture and market a broad line of high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. We sell our ICs to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, many of whom use products spanning our core technologies in a wide range of applications. Our IC product portfolio includes both general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications, as well as application-specific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets. By using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing more customized ICs, our standard products often provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume applications. We also focus on working with leading customers to design application-specific solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies, which leverage our data conversion, amplification, RF and microwave, MEMS, power management and DSP capabilities, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers. Because we have already developed the core technology platform for our general-purpose products, we can create application-specific solutions quickly.
We produce and market a broad range of ICs and operate in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments. The ICs sold by each of our operating segments are manufactured using similar semiconductor manufacturing processes and raw materials in either our own production facilities or by third-party wafer fabricators using proprietary processes. Our ICs are sold to customers globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Our ten highest revenue products, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 16% of our revenue for our fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 ( fiscal 2015 ).
Analog Products Our analog and mixed signal IC technology has been the foundation of our business for over four decades, and we are one of the worlds largest suppliers of high-performance analog ICs. Our analog signal processing ICs are primarily high-performance devices, offering higher dynamic range, greater bandwidth, and other enhanced features. We believe that the principal advantages these products have as compared to competitors products include higher accuracy, higher speed, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer components, resulting in improved performance and reliability. Our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems.
Converters We are a leading supplier of data converter products. Data converters translate real-world analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals. Data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family and an area where we are continuously innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their products. Our converter products combine sampling rates and accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package size required by industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications electronics.
Amplifiers/Radio Frequency We are also a leading supplier of high-performance amplifiers. Amplifiers are used to condition analog signals. High performance amplifiers emphasize the performance dimensions of speed and precision. Within this product portfolio we provide precision, instrumentation, high speed, intermediate frequency/RF, broadband, and other amplifiers. We also offer an extensive portfolio of precision voltage references that are used in a wide variety of applications. Our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of high performance RF ICs covering the entire RF signal chain, from industry-leading stand-alone RF function blocks such as phase locked loops, frequency synthesizers, mixers, modulators, demodulators, and power detectors, to highly integrated broadband and short-range single chip transceiver solutions. Our high performance RF ICs support the high performance requirements of cellular infrastructure and a broad range of applications in our target markets.
3 Other Analog Also within our analog technology portfolio are products that are based on MEMS technology. This technology enables us to build extremely small sensors that incorporate an electromechanical structure and the supporting analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. Our MEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to sense rotation and inertial measurement units used to sense multiple degrees of freedom combining multiple sensing types along multiple axes. The majority of our current revenue from MEMS products is derived from the automotive end market. In addition to our MEMS products, our other analog product category includes isolators that enable designers to implement isolation in designs without the cost, size, power, performance, and reliability constraints found with optocouplers. Our isolators have been designed into hundreds of applications, such as universal serial bus isolation in patient monitors, where it allows hospitals and physicians to adopt the latest advances in computer technology to supervise patient health and wirelessly transmit medical records. In smart metering applications, our isolators provide reliable electrostatic discharge performance that helps reduce meter tampering. Likewise, in satellites, where any malfunction can be catastrophic, our isolators help protect the power system while enabling designers to achieve small form factors.
Power Management& Reference Power managementand reference products make up the balance of our analog sales. Those products, which include functions such as power conversion, driver monitoring, sequencing and energy management, are developed to complement analog signal chain components across core market segments from micro power, energy-sensitive battery applications to efficient, high performance power systems in infrastructure and industrial applications.
Digital Signal Processing Products Digital Signal Processing products (DSPs) complete our product portfolio. DSPs are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases, from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSPs are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs are designed to provide the flexibility to modify the devices function quickly and inexpensively using software. Our general-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third-party suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in families of products that share common architectures and therefore can execute the same software across a range of products. We support these products with easy-to-use development tools, which are designed to reduce our customers product development costs and time-to-market. Our customers use our products to solve a wide range of signal processing challenges across our core market and segment focus areas within the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications end markets. As an integrated part of our customers' signal chain, there are typically many other Analog Devices products connected to our processors, including converters, audio and video codecs and power management solutions.

Communications technology involves the processing of signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and receiving data. The need for higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable, bandwidth-efficient communications, creates demand for our products, which are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for internet protocol, video streaming and voice communication. In wireless and broadband communication applications, our products are incorporated into:  Cellular basestation equipment  Wired networking and data center equipment  Wireless backhaul systems  Satellite systems See Note4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for further information about our products by end market.
Research and Development Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes, and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes. We spent approximately $637 million during fiscal 2015 on the design, development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes, compared to approximately $560 million during the fiscal year ended November 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014 ) and approximately $513 million during the fiscal year ended November 2, 2013 (fiscal 2013 ).
Our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technology platforms, which include converters, amplifiers and RF and microwave, MEMS, power management, and DSP. In support of our research and development activities, we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, mask works and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. As of October31, 2015 , we held approximately 2,280 U.S.patents and approximately 635 non-provisional pending U.S.patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2015 through 2034. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. It is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions, if we determine other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine Analog Devices components.
Sales Channels We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. We have direct sales offices, sales representatives and/or distributors in over 40 countries outside North America.
We support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications, webinars, social media and communities, promotional and training videos, direct mail programs, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish, share and distribute technical content such as data sheets, application guides and catalogs. We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products. In addition, we offer a variety of web-based tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers.
6 We derived approximately 50% of our fiscal 2015 revenue from sales made through distributors. These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell products that compete with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. In all regions of the world, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. We make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in Note2n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Segment Financial Information and Geographic Information We operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments.
Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal 2015 , we derived approximately 61% of our revenue from customers in international markets. Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign governments. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies.
Revenue by geographic region, based on the primary location of our customers' design activity for our products, for fiscal 2015 was as follow: Percent of Fiscal 2015 Geographic Area Revenue United States 39% Rest of North/South America 3% Europe 27% Japan 9% China 15% Rest of Asia 7% For further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry, segment and geographic areas, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note4 in the related Notes contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. For a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us, see the Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Customers We have over 100,000 customers worldwide. Our largest single customer represented approximately 13% of fiscal 2015 revenue. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2014 , or fiscal 2013 revenue. Our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial, automotive, consumer and communication markets. Our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of our fiscal 2015 revenue.
Seasonality Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk factors contained in Item1A of this Annual Report on Form10-K, our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.
7 Production and Raw Materials Monolithic IC components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual chips, or dice, assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form. The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging.
We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high-performance analog, DSP, mixed-signal and MEMS ICs. We also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, wafer fabrication processes.
Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. Our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at third-party wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS processes. We currently source approximately 60% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate test facilities located in the Philippines and use third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products.
Capital spending was approximately $154 million in fiscal 2015 , compared with approximately $178 million in fiscal 2014 . We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million.
Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers, primarily TSMC. If TSMC or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of components, materials and external foundry services from time to time, these items have generally been available to us as needed.
Backlog Backlog at the end of fiscal 2015 was approximately $626 million , up from approximately $538 million at the end of fiscal 2014 . We define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue.
We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.
Government Contracts We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2015 revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S.government and U.S.government contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm, fixed-price subcontracts. Most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the U.S.government.
8 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. From time to time, we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business.
On July 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation (Hittite), a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion.
On October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to InvenSense, Inc. (InvenSense). We received $100.0 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property at the closing.
Additional information relating to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is set forth in Note6 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Competition We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors, including technological innovation, strength of brand, diversity of product portfolio, product performance, technical support, delivery capabilities, customer service quality, reliability and price, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets, and customers.
We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive. Our competitors include but are not limited to: Robert Bosch GmbH Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.
Broadcom Corporation Microchip Technology, Inc.
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.
NXP Semiconductors Infineon Technologies Texas Instruments, Inc.
Linear Technology Corporation We believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support, enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers competitiveness in our chosen markets.
Environment, Health and Safety We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities, and to encourage pollution prevention, reduce our water and energy consumption, reduce waste generation, and strive towards continual improvement. We strive to achieve excellence in EHS management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system.
Our management systems are certified to ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001 and TS16949. We are a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). Our Sustainability Report, first published in 2009, states our commitment to consuming less energy and applying fair labor standards, among other things. We are not including the information contained in our Sustainability Report in, or incorporating it by reference into this Annual Report on Form10-K.
Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal, state, local and foreign EHS laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the transportation, storage, handling, use, emission, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products, including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive in the European Union and China and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directive in the European Union. Contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional EHS compliance standards. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us. Any failure by us to comply with applicable 9 environmental laws, regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines, suspension of production, the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability.
Employees As of October31, 2015 , we employed approximately 9,700 individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers involved in the design, support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes. We believe that relations with our employees are good; however, the competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
10 ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
There is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.
Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:  the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;  changes in customer demand for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;  our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;  changes in geographic, product or customer mix;  changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland or worldwide;  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors;  competitive pricing pressures;  fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;  the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;  a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;  a decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards;  any significant decline in our backlog;  the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;  our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;  the increasing costs of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, pension plan and retirement plan contributions and retirement benefits;  our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;  potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers; 11  the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;  the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations; and  the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts, government sanctions and other events beyond our control.
In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i)that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii)that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.
Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate in 2015 was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation (including proposed revisions to Irish tax laws) or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.
Long-term contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customers unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.
Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes 12 competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.
We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.
We face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the U.S., including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.
We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.
We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 60% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC .
In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.
The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.
The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and 13 operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.
Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products.
Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.
We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We are involved in frequent litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.
We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property.
There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or 14 pending applications corresponding to our U.S.patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.
We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.
A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.
We rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.
If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.
Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.
To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.
An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both in the U.S.and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.
Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:  difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;  diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets; 15  strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;  the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;  potential loss of key employees;  exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies;  higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition;  difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and  increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.
If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.
We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.
We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland and the Philippines. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:  political, legal and economic changes or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;  currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;  limitations on the repatriation of earnings;  economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;  increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;  complex and varying government regulations and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including U.S. customs and export regulations, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  natural disasters or pandemics;  transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;  changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;  trade and travel restrictions or government sanctions, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on trading with parties in foreign countries;  fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and  costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.
16 Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Many of these risks are present in China.  While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by Chinas continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, antitrust,  the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, and restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.
At October31, 2015 , our principal source of liquidity was $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $657.8 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S.cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.
A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.
Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, minerals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation; the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available; damage to our reputation; and/or increased expenses associated with compliance, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.
Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.
17 In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.
Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes.
In April 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0million aggregate principal amount of 3.0%senior unsecured notes due April15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes).  In June 2013, we issued in a public offering $500.0million aggregate principal amount of 2.875%senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes and together with the 2016 Notes, the Notes).  Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:  seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes;  borrow under our existing revolving credit facility;  divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;  repatriate earnings at higher tax rates that are permanently reinvested in foreign locations;  sell selected assets; or  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.
Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the Notes, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms.
Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.
Our current revolving credit facility and the Notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indentures governing the Notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
Our stock price may be volatile.
The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:  global economic conditions generally;  crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results; 18  changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;  changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;  rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us or other companies in our industry;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;  departures of key personnel;  alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors;and  negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.
The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.
Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.

The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion , financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion.  The acquisition of Hittite is referred to as the Acquisition. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K for further discussion related to the Acquisition.
Revenue Trends by End Market The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
2015 2014 2013 Revenue % of Total Product Revenue Y/Y% Revenue % of Total Product Revenue* Revenue % of Total Product Revenue* Industrial $ 1,496,198 44 % 11 % $ 1,343,255 47 % $ 1,220,141 46 % Automotive 526,124 15 %  % 525,712 18 % 483,771 18 % Consumer 729,965 21 % 123 % 327,223 11 % 401,368 15 % Communications 682,805 20 % 2 % 668,583 23 % 528,409 20 % Total Revenue $ 3,435,092 100 % 20 % $ 2,864,773 100 % $ 2,633,689 100 % * The sum of the individual percentages does not equal the total due to rounding.
The year-over-year increase in the industrial and communications end market revenue in fiscal 2015 was the result of the Acquisition. Consumer end market revenue increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increased demand for products sold into the portable sector of this end market.
The year-to-year increase in communications end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increased wireless base station deployment activity and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition. Industrial end market revenue increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of an increase in demand in this end market, which was most significant for products sold into the instrumentation and automation sectors and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition.  The year-to-year increase in automotive end market revenue in fiscal 2014 was primarily a result of increasing electronic content in vehicles and higher demand for new vehicles. The year-to-year decrease in revenue in the consumer end market in fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of the sale of our microphone product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
26 Revenue Trends by Geographic Region Revenue by geographic region, based upon the primary location of our customers' design activity for its products, for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was as follows: Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change United States $ 1,325,279 $ 821,554 $ 821,269 $ 503,725 61 % $ 285  % Rest of North and South America 97,189 96,957 99,215 232  % (2,258 ) (2 )% Europe 939,230 924,477 840,585 14,753 2 % 83,892 10 % Japan 319,569 308,054 292,804 11,515 4 % 15,250 5 % China 511,365 459,260 349,575 52,105 11 % 109,685 31 % Rest of Asia 242,460 254,471 230,241 (12,011 ) (5 )% 24,230 11 % Total Revenue $ 3,435,092 $ 2,864,773 $ 2,633,689 $ 570,319 20 % $ 231,084 9 % In fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the predominant countries comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant countries comprising Europe are Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom; and the predominant countries comprising Rest of Asia are South Korea and Taiwan.
The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the United States was primarily the result of increased demand for consumer products sold into the portable sector and the Acquisition. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in Europe was primarily the result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in wireless base stations. The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in Japan was primarily a result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in demand for products used in home entertainment.  The sales increase in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in China was primarily a result of the Acquisition. The sales decrease in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in the Rest of Asia was primarily the result of a decrease in demand in most end markets, partially offset by the Acquisition.
On a regional basis, the year-over-year sales increases for fiscal 2014 in most regions were the result of an increase in demand in the communications, industrial and automotive end markets and an increase in revenue as a result of the Acquisition, partially offset by a lower demand for products used in consumer applications.
Gross Margin Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Gross Margin $ 2,259,262 $ 1,830,188 $ 1,692,411 $ 429,074 23 % $ 137,777 8 % Gross Margin % 65.8 % 63.9 % 64.3 % Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 increased 190 basis points compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of lower amortization expense of purchased inventory recognized in fiscal 2014 as a result of the Acquisition.
Gross margin percentage decreased by 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of recording approximately $53.6 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the Acquisition. This expense was partially offset by the improved utilization levels in our manufacturing facilities and, to a lesser extent, a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold as a result of the Acquisition.
27 Research and Development (R&D) Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change R&D Expenses $ 637,459 $ 559,686 $ 513,035 $ 77,773 14 % $ 46,651 9 % R&D Expenses as a % of Revenue 18.6 % 19.5 % 19.5 % R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increases in operational spending resulting from the Acquisition, variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and R&D employee and related benefit expenses.
R&D expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, higher R&D employee and related benefit expenses, and a general increase in other operational spending.  Approximately $15.0 million of the overall increase year-over-year was a result of the Acquisition.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future.
Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A) Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change SMG&A Expenses $ 478,972 $ 454,676 $ 396,233 $ 24,296 5 % $ 58,443 15 % SMG&A Expenses as a % of Revenue 13.9 % 15.9 % 15.0 % SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses, as well as operational spending resulting from the Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Acquisition-related transition costs and other activity.
SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to Acquisition-related transaction costs and other activity of approximately $33.3 million.  The remainder of the increases were primarily due to higher variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, higher SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses as a result of an increased headcount attributable to the Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, increases in other operational spending.  The increases in SMG&A employee and related benefit expenses were partially offset by a lower stock-based compensation expense as fiscal 2013 included $6.3 million related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units following the death of the Company's then-CEO in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
Amortization of Intangibles During fiscal 2015 , we recognized approximately $88.3 million of amortization expense within operating expense. Approximately $87.8 million of this expense related to the $665.5 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the Acquisition. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
During fiscal 2014, we recognized approximately$26.0 millionof amortization expense within operating expenses of which approximately $25.9 million related to the $665.5 million of amortizable intangible assets acquired as a result of the Acquisition. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
28 Special Charges We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. The expense reductions relating to ongoing actions are described below.
During fiscal 2014, we recorded special charges of approximately $37.3 million .  These special charges included $37.9 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 341 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees; $0.5 million for lease obligations costs for facilities that we ceased using during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014; and $0.4 million for the impairment of assets that have no future use located at closed facilities. We reversed approximately $ 1.4 million of our severance accrual related to charges taken in fiscal 2013, primarily due to severance costs being lower than our estimates. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. We expect this action will result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $46.2 million, once fully implemented.
During fiscal 2013, we recorded special charges of approximately $29.8 million for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for 235 engineering and SMG&A employees. We terminated the employment of all employees associated with this action. This action resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $32.6 million.
We expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future.
Other Operating Expense During fiscal 2015, we converted the benefits provided to participants in our Irish defined benefits pension plan to benefits provided under our Irish defined contribution plan. Retired pension plan participants received an annuity.  As a result, in fiscal 2015 we recorded settlement charges, legal, accounting and other professional fees totaling  $ 223.7 million to settle all existing and future Irish pension plan liabilities.
Operating Income Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Operating income $ 830,841 $ 752,484 $ 753,075 $ 78,357 10 % $ (591 )  % Operating income as a % of Revenue 24.2 % 26.3 % 28.6 % The increase in operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $570.3 million , a 190  basis point increase in gross margin percentage and a $37.3 million decrease in special charges, partially offset by a $223.7 million increase in other operating expense, a $77.8 million increase in R&D expenses, a $24.3 million increase in SMG&A expenses and a $62.3 million increase in amortization of intangibles more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles, Special Charges and Other Operating Expense.
The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue of $231.1 million , which was offset by a 40 basis point decrease in gross margin percentage, a $46.7 million increase in R&D expenses, a $58.4 million increase in SMG&A expenses, a $25.8 million increase in amortization of intangibles, and a $7.5 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings Research and Development (R&D), Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A), Amortization of Intangibles and Special Charges.

The change in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of recognizing other income of $85.4 million from the sale of a product line in fiscal 2013, as more fully described below under the heading Divestitures, partially offset by the net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.2 million in conjunction with the redemption of our $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2013 as more fully described below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Interest and fees related to the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the Acquisition caused our interest expense to increase year-over-year from fiscal 2013.
Provision for Income Taxes Change Fiscal Year 2015 over 2014 2014 over 2013 2015 2014 2013 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Provision for Income Taxes $ 113,236 $ 100,025 $ 141,836 $ 13,211 13 % $ (41,811 ) (29 )% Effective Income Tax Rate 14.0 % 13.7 % 17.4 % Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.
The tax rate for all periods presented was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.  Income from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 86% of our total revenues for fiscal 2015, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $198.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.6% in fiscal 2015, compared to a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.7% in fiscal 2014. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate.  In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was reduced as a result of $13.0 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities, a tax benefit of $7.0 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in December 2014 retroactive to January 1, 2014 and a tax benefit of $3.8 million as a result of an acquisition accounting adjustment. In addition our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included $2.0 million of discrete tax expense items associated with the U.S. provision to return adjustments. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items.
Income from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenues for fiscal 2014, resulting in a material portion of our pretax income being earned and taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, at rates ranging from 0% to 35%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $179.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.7% in fiscal 2014 compared to a benefit of approximately $162.3 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 10.0% for fiscal 2013. A reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers the overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate.  In addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was not significantly impacted by discrete items. Our 30 effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was lower by approximately 3% due to $6.6 million recorded as a result of the reversal of certain prior period tax liabilities and a tax benefit of $6.3 million from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit in January 2013 retroactive to January 1, 2012.

The decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily a result of the $85.4 million decrease in nonoperating income partially offset by the $41.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes.
The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.
Divestitures On October 31, 2013, we completed the sale of the assets and intellectual property related to our microphone product line to InvenSense, Inc. (InvenSense). We received $100.0 million in cash for the assets and intellectual property and after providing for the write-off of inventory, fixed assets and other costs incurred to complete the transaction, recorded a net gain of $85.4 million in nonoperating income during fiscal 2013. The sale of the assets and intellectual property related to the microphone product line did not qualify as a discontinued operation as it was not considered to be a component of the Company per the applicable guidance.
Acquisitions On July 22, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Hittite (the Acquisition), a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications.  The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion , financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion. We recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, resulting in the recognition of $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets, including $0.9 million of in-process research and development intangible assets.  We recognized approximately $50.9 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting, severance, debt financing, interest and other related fees of which approximately $9.7 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and $41.2 million in fiscal 2014.  These costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within SMG&A expenses as well as non-operating expenses.  The Acquisition resulted in the creation of a new operating segment.  We continue to operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents our combined results of operations after giving effect to the Acquisition and assumes that the Acquisition, which closed on July 22, 2014, was completed on November 4, 2012 (the first day of the Companys 2013 fiscal year).  The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, transaction-related costs, increase in cost of sales for inventory acquired and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the Acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects.  These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of our operating results that would have been achieved had the Acquisition actually taken place on November 4, 2012. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the Acquisition, including but not limited to revenue enhancements, cost savings or operating synergies that the combined Company may achieve as a result of the Acquisition.

The balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases.  If these funds are needed for U.S. operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition, including money market funds, and our short-term investments consist primarily of corporate obligations, such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) under our stock repurchase program in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.
Fiscal Year 2015 2014 2013 Net Cash Provided by Operations $ 907,798 $ 871,602 $ 912,345 Net Cash Provided by Operations as a % of Revenue 26.4 % 30.4 % 34.6 % Net Cash Used for Investing Activities $ (17,125 ) $ (114,751 ) $ (949,926 ) Net Used for Financing Activities $ (571,603 ) $ (576,610 ) $ (100,557 ) At October31, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents totaled $884.4 million .  The following changes contributed to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $315.1 million in fiscal 2015.
Operating Activities During fiscal 2015, we generated cash from operating activities of $907.8 million , an increase of $36.2 million compared to the $871.6 million generated in fiscal 2014.Results of operations, after non-cash adjustments to net income, contributed $917.8 million compared to a contribution of $726.6 million in fiscal 2014. The contribution by results of operations was offset by changes in net cash inflows from working capital changes.
Investing Activities During fiscal 2015, cash used for investing activities included $154.0 million for property, plant and equipment additions, and $7.1 million for payments for acquisitions.  We received $152.2 million in proceeds from the net sales of available-for-sale short term investments and s.
Financing Activities During fiscal 2015, cash used for financing activities included, proceeds of $122.6 million from employee stock option exercises. We distributed $491.1 million to our shareholders in dividend payments and paid $227.0 million for the repurchase of 4.1 million shares of our common stock.
32 Working Capital Fiscal Year 2015 2014 $ Change % Change Accounts Receivable $ 466,527 $ 396,605 $ 69,922 18 % Days Sales Outstanding 46 46 Inventory $ 412,314 $ 367,927 $ 44,387 12 % Days Cost of Sales in Inventory 121 115 The increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the final month of thefourthquarter of fiscal2015as compared to the final month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Overall, our days in sales outstanding remained consistent year-over-year.
Inventory as of October31, 2015 increased as compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of increased manufacturing production to support anticipated higher sales demand. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. Days cost of sales in inventory increased from 115 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to 121 days at the end of fiscal 2015 as a result of recognizing approximately $53.6 million of additional cost related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value as a result of the Acquisition in fiscal 2014.
Current liabilities increased to $1.1 billion at October31, 2015 from $709.1 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of the classification of our $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 as current and, to a lesser extent, increases in accounts payable, deferred income on shipments to distributors as more fully described below and accrued liabilities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in income taxes payable.
As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , we had gross deferred revenue of $379.9 million and $349.7 million , respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $79.8 million and $71.3 million , respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers. The amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. To the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.
Debt As of October31, 2015 , we had $873.3 million of carrying value outstanding on our debt.  The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal amount of the debt is due to the unamortized discount on these instruments that will accrete to the face value of the debt over the term of the debt. Our debt obligations consist of the following: $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0%senior unsecured notes On April4, 2011 , we issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0%senior unsecured notes due April15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October15, 2011 .
$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875%senior unsecured notes On June3, 2013 , we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December1, 2013 .
The indentures governing the 2016Notes and the 2023 Notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October31, 2015 , we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 16 33 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.
Revolving Credit Facility On July 10, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the Credit Agreement) dated as ofDecember 19, 2012. The Credit Agreement expires on July 10, 2020, and provides that we may borrow up to$750.0 million. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt toconsolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0. As of October31, 2015 , we were compliant with these covenants .
$2.0 billion term loan facility On July22, 2014, we entered into a 90-day term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion with Credit Suisse AG, as Administrative Agent, and each lender from time to time party thereto (the Term Loan Agreement) to finance the Acquisition. On August 29, 2014, we repaid in full the outstanding principal balance due under the Term Loan Agreement.
Stock Repurchase Program Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004 . In the aggregate, our Board of Directors have authorized us to repurchase $5.6 billion of our common stock under the program. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October31, 2015 , we had repurchased a total of approximately 140.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.0 billion under this program. As of October31, 2015 , an additional $544.5 million worth of shares remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. Any future common stock repurchases will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash we have available in the United States.
Capital Expenditures Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $154.0 million in fiscal 2015 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
Dividends On November23, 2015 , our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December15, 2015 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December4, 2015 and is expected to total approximately $124.8 million . We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.40 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.
34 Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of October31, 2015 : Payment due by period Less than More than (thousands) Total 1Year 1-3Years 3-5Years 5Years Contractual obligations: Operating leases ( a) $ 59,488 $ 21,780 $ 24,975 $ 7,470 $ 5,263 Debt obligations 875,000 375,000   500,000 Interest payments associated with debt obligations 120,625 20,000 28,750 28,750 43,125 Deferred compensation plan (b) 24,124    24,124 Pension funding (c) 4,236 4,236    Purchase Orders (d) 10,000 10,000    Total $ 1,093,473 $ 431,016 $ 53,725 $ 36,220 $ 572,512 _______________________________________ (a) Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(b) These payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The amount in the More than 5Years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. Since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the More than 5Years column of the table.
(c) Our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2016. The actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.
(d) Represents a non-cancelable inventory purchase obligation for certain raw materials though March 31, 2016 as part of a planned transition from a principal foundry supplier. We generally do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. Other purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. In addition, our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties.
Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, which could be up to $3.0 million , as the timing and amounts are uncertain.
As of October31, 2015 , our total liabilities associated with deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions was $81.0 million , which are included in Other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
The expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of October31, 2015 .
Off-balance Sheet Financing As of October31, 2015 , we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
35 New Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2t, New Accounting Pronouncements , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year, and as a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein, which is the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The guidance allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and for certain foreign counties. Revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. We use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.
Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
36 Inventory Valuation We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be required. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
Long-Lived Assets We review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1)or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform a qualitative assessment on its indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize into earnings any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.
Goodwill Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about August 1)or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. For our latest annual impairment assessment which occurred on August 2, 2015, we identified our reporting units to be our six operating segments.  The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies, which requires significant judgment by management. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. These impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Business Combinations Under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration 37 over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
Accounting for Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. We assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S.or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
We account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. A change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. We calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock 38 option. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. As it relates to our market-based restricted stock units, we utilize the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to value these awards. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. We recognize the expense related to these on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for more information related to stock based compensation.
Contingencies From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
39 ITEM 7A.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Exposure Our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable securities and short term investments, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.
Based on our marketable securities and short-term investments outstanding as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , our annual interest income would change by approximately $27 million and $29million, respectively, for each 100basis point increase in interest rates.
To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , a hypothetical 100basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $5million and $7 million decline, respectively in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.
As of October31, 2015 , we had $875million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, which consisted of $375million 3%senior unsecured notes due April15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and $500 million 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes). As of October31, 2015 , a hypothetical 100basis point increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2016 Notes outstanding by approximately $2million. As of October31, 2015 , a similar increase in market interest rates would reduce the fair value of our 2023 Notes by $32 million.
Foreign Currency Exposure As more fully described in Note2i in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K, we regularly hedge our non-U.S.dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the Euro, primarily because our European operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $8million of losses and $8million of gains, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.
The market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of October31, 2015 , we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.
The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the U.S.dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 : October31, 2015 November1, 2014 Fair value of forward exchange contracts liability $ (3,083 ) $ (10,093 ) Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset $ 13,595 $ 7,918 Fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability $ (18,736 ) $ (27,051 ) The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S.dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 ( fiscal 2015 ). Such reclassified amounts were immaterial. The Companys fiscal year is the 52 -week or 53 -week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2015 , and the fiscal year ended November 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014) and the fiscal year ended November 2, 2013 (fiscal 2013) were 52 -week periods.
On July 22, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation (Hittite), a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications. The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion , financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion . The acquisition of Hittite is referred to as the Acquisition. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial results of Hittite prospectively from July 22, 2014, the closing date of the Acquisition. See Note 6, Acquisitions , of these notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the Acquisition.
b.    Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of ninety days or less at the time of acquisition. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of institutional money market funds, corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds and bank time deposits.
The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading at the time of purchase. There were no transfers between investment classifications in any of the fiscal years presented. Held-to-maturity securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities such as bank time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are classified as such. The Companys other readily marketable cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.  Adjustments to the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, unless the adjustment is considered an other-than-temporary impairment, in which case the adjustment is recorded as a charge in the statement of income.
The Companys deferred compensation plan investments are classified as trading. See Note7 for additional information on the Companys deferred compensation plan investments. There were no cash equivalents or short-term investments classified as trading at October31, 2015 or November1, 2014 .
47 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company periodically evaluates its investments for impairment. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of short-term investments in any of the fiscal years presented.
Realized gains or losses on investments are determined based on the specific identification basis and are recognized in nonoperating (income) expense. There were no material net realized gains or losses from the sales of available-for-sale investments during any of the fiscal periods presented.
Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities classified as short-term investments at October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 were as follows: 2015 2014 Unrealized gains on securities classified as short-term investments $ 233 $ 541 Unrealized losses on securities classified as short-term investments (584 ) (407 ) Net unrealized losses on securities classified as short-term investments $ (351 ) $ 134 Unrealized gains and losses in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 relate to corporate obligations.
As of October31, 2015 , the Company held 76 investment securities, 23 of which were in an unrealized loss position with gross unrealized losses of $0.6 million and an aggregate fair value of $823.4 million .  As of November1, 2014 , the Company held 66 investment securities, 18 of which were in an unrealized loss position with gross unrealized losses of $0.4 million and an aggregate fair value of $694.7 million . These unrealized losses were primarily related to corporate obligations that earn lower interest rates than current market rates. None of these investments have been in a loss position for more than twelve months. As the Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is unlikely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized basis, which will be at maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 .
The components of the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 were as follows: 2015 2014 Cash and cash equivalents: Cash $ 72,638 $ 117,337 Available-for-sale 807,935 447,968 Held-to-maturity 3,780 3,928 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 884,353 $ 569,233 Short-term investments: Available-for-sale $ 2,144,575 $ 2,297,235 Total short-term investments $ 2,144,575 $ 2,297,235 See Note2j for additional information on the Companys cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Supplemental Cash Flow Statement Information 2015 2014 2013 Cash paid during the fiscal year for: Income taxes $ 142,931 $ 73,067 $ 36,863 Interest $ 25,625 $ 27,931 $ 29,354 d.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The valuation of inventory requires the Company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The Company employs a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of its inventory. While a portion of the calculation to record inventory at its net realizable value is based on the age of the inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, a key factor in estimating obsolete or excess inventory requires the Company to estimate the future demand for its products. If actual demand is less than the Companys estimates, impairment charges, which are recorded to cost of sales, may need to be recorded in future periods. Inventory in excess of saleable amounts is not valued, and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. As of November 1, 2014, approximately $8.8 million of raw materials was classified as non-current and was 48 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) presented within the consolidated balance sheet as other assets as the Company did not expect this inventory to be sold within one year. This inventory was purchased as part of a planned transition from a principal foundry supplier and was acquired by the Company through the Acquisition. The larger than normal purchase was made to maintain an adequate supply of the raw material for customers, which has a natural life of five to ten years.
Inventories at October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 were as follows: 2015 2014 Raw materials $ 21,825 $ 47,267 Work in process 261,520 216,765 Finished goods 128,969 103,895 Total inventories $ 412,314 $ 367,927 Non-current inventories $  $ 8,793 e.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less allowances for depreciation. The straight-line method of depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial statement purposes while both straight-line and accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are based on the following useful lives: Buildings Up to 25years Machinery& equipment 3-8years Office equipment 3-8years Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $130.1 million , $114.1 million and $110.2 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. If such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life. We have not recorded any material impairment charges related to our property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 .
f.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. For the Companys latest annual impairment assessment that occurred on August2, 2015 , the Company identified its reporting units to be its six operating segments, , which meet the aggregation criteria for one reportable segment. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that reporting unit. There was no impairment of goodwill in any of the fiscal years presented.  The Companys next annual impairment assessment will be performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 unless indicators arise that would require the Company to reevaluate at an earlier date. The following table presents the changes in goodwill during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 : 49 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 2015 2014 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,642,438 $ 284,112 Acquisition of Hittite (Note6) (1) (1,105 ) 1,357,077 Goodwill adjustment related to other acquisitions (2) 3,663 1,337 Foreign currency translation adjustment (8,470 ) (88 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,636,526 $ 1,642,438 (1) Amount in fiscal 2015 represents changes to goodwill as a result of finalizing the acquisition accounting related to the Acquisition.
(2) Represents goodwill related to other acquisitions that were not material to the Company on either an individual or aggregate basis.
Intangible Assets The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the Companys finite-lived intangible assets consisted of the following: October31, 2015 November1, 2014 GrossCarrying Amount Accumulated Amortization GrossCarrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Customer relationships $ 624,900 $ 88,913 $ 624,900 $ 19,473 Technology-based $ 16,200 $ 5,934 $ 16,200 $ 1,627 Backlog $ 25,500 $ 25,500 $ 25,500 $ 7,154 Total $ 666,600 $ 120,347 $ 666,600 $ 28,254 Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $92.1 million , $27.9 million and $0.2 million in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The remaining amortization expense will be recognized over a weighted average life of approximately 3.9 years .
The Company expects annual amortization expense for intangible assets as follows: Fiscal Year AmortizationExpense 2016 $ 73,208 2017 $ 73,208 2018 $ 72,149 2019 $ 69,433 2020 $ 69,433 Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about August 1) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment test involves a qualitative assessment on the indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  If it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, the Company would recognize into earnings the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. No impairment of intangible assets resulted from the impairment tests in any of the fiscal years presented.
Definite-lived intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or on an accelerated method of amortization that is expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use. IPR&D assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. Upon completion of the projects, the IPR&D assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives.
50 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Indefinite-lived intangible assets consisted of $37.3 million and $33.1 million of IPR&D as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , respectively.
g.
Grant Accounting Certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries have received grants from governmental agencies. These grants include capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee hiring and training, and research and development grants are recognized in earnings in the period in which the related expenditures are incurred by the Company.
h.
Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency for the Companys foreign sales and research and development operations is the applicable local currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currencies into U.S.dollars are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains and losses and re-measurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are included in income currently, including those at the Companys principal foreign manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the U.S.dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
i.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Agreements Foreign Exchange Exposure Management The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the Companys operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S.dollar, primarily the Euro; other significant exposures include the Philippine Peso, the Japanese Yen and the British Pound. These foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to support transactions made in the normal course of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less . Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness monthly. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. As the terms of the contract and the underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in fair value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (OCI) in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments, or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other (income) expense. Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other (income) expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged. As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the total notional amount of these undesignated hedges was $57.9 million and $45.2 million , respectively. The fair value of these hedging instruments in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 was immaterial .
Interest Rate Exposure Management The Company's current and future debt may be subject to interest rate risk. The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce the effects of these changes.
On October28, 2014 , the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap transactions to hedge its exposure to the variability in future cash flows due to changes in interest rates for debt issuances expected to occur in the future. Amounts reported in OCI related to these derivatives will be reclassified from OCI to earnings as interest expense is incurred on the forecasted hedged fixed-rate debt, adjusting interest expense to reflect the fixed-rate entered into by the forward starting swaps. These cash flow instruments hedge forecasted interest payments to be made through 2025. These forward starting swaps will be terminated on December1, 2015 . As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the total notional value of these hedges was $500.0 million . The fair value of these hedges was $32.7 million as of October 31, 2015, included in accrued liabilities, and $1.7 million as of November 1, 2014, included in other assets, in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
On April24, 2013 , the Company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement with Bank of America.  This agreement allowed the Company to lock a 10-year US Treasury rate of 1.7845% through June14, 2013 for its anticipated issuance of the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (2023 Notes). The Company designated this agreement as a cash flow hedge.  On June3, 2013 , the Company terminated the treasury rate lock simultaneously with the issuance of the 2023 Notes which resulted in a gain of approximately $11.0 million .  This gain is being 51 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) amortized into interest expense over the 10-year term of the 2023 Notes.  During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 approximately $1.1 million and $1.1 million , respectively, was amortized from OCI into interest expense and approximately $1.1 million will be amortized from OCI into interest expense within the next 12months.
On June 30, 2009 , the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions related to its outstanding $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014 (the 2014 Notes) where the Company swapped the notional amount of its $375.0 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into floating interest rate debt through July 1, 2014 . The Company designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of the swaps at inception was zero and subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. The amounts earned and owed under the swap agreements were accrued each period and were reported in interest expense. There was no ineffectiveness recognized in any of the periods presented. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement. The Company received $19.8 million in cash proceeds from the swap termination, which included $1.3 million in accrued interest. The proceeds, net of interest received, are disclosed in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of the termination, the carrying value of the 2014 Notes was adjusted for the change in the fair value of the interest component of the debt up to the date of the termination of the swap in an amount equal to the fair value of the swap, and was amortized into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. During fiscal 2013 and 2012, $4.6 million and $5.3 million , respectively, were amortized into earnings as a reduction of interest expense related to the swap termination. This amortization is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, in conjunction with the redemption of the 2014 Notes, the Company recognized the remaining $8.6 million in unamortized proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap as other, net expense.
The market risk associated with the Companys derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Companys derivative instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of the Companys counterparties as of October31, 2015 , nonperformance is not perceived to be a material risk. Furthermore, none of the Companys derivatives are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on the Companys credit ratings from any credit rating agency. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant.
The Company records the fair value of its derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements in other current assets, other assets or accrued liabilities, depending on their net position, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the derivative contract. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in earnings or in shareholders equity as a component of OCI. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying contract matures. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting or the ineffective portion of designated hedges are reported in earnings as they occur.
The total notional amounts of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments of cash flow hedges denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Philippine Pesos and Japanese Yen as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 was $163.9 million and $183.5 million , respectively. The fair values of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 were as follows: Fair Value At Balance Sheet Location October31, 2015 November1, 2014 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts Accrued liabilities $ 3,091 $ 10,584 For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on derivatives included in and reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into the consolidated statement of income related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts, see Note 2o, Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income .

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Company estimates that $1.8 million of forward foreign currency derivative instruments included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12months.  There was no material ineffectiveness during the fiscal years ended October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 .
All of the Companys derivative financial instruments are eligible for nettingarrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled under these arrangements have been presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet on a net basis.  As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , none of the nettingarrangements involved collateral. The following table presents the gross amounts of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities and the net amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 : October31, 2015 November 1, 2014 Gross amount of recognized liabilities $ (3,896 ) $ (10,736 ) Gross amounts of recognized assets offset in the consolidated balance sheet 813 643 Net liabilities presented in the consolidated balance sheet $ (3,083 ) $ (10,093 ) j.
Fair Value The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level3 measurements).
Level1 Level1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level2 Level2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level3 Level3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
The tables below, set forth by level, presents the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding accrued interest components, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 . The tables exclude cash on hand and assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the Company held $76.4 million and $121.3 million , respectively, of cash and held-to-maturity investments that were excluded from the tables below.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments: Cash equivalents and short-term investments These investments are adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.
Deferred compensation plan investments The fair value of these mutual fund, money market fund and equity investments are based on quoted market prices.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts The estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the estimated amount the Company would receive if it sold these agreements at the reporting date taking into consideration current interest rates as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and the Companys creditworthiness for liabilities. The fair value of these instruments is based upon valuation models using current market information such as strike price, spot rate, maturity date and volatility.
55 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Interest rate swap agreements Thefair value of interest rate swap agreements is based on the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments.
Contingent consideration The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated utilizing the income approach and is based upon significant inputs not observable in the market. The income approach is based on two steps. The first step involves a projection of the cash flows that is based on the Companys estimates of the timing and probability of achieving the defined milestones. The second step involves converting the cash flows into a present value equivalent through discounting. The discount rate reflects the Baa costs of debt plus the relevant risk associated with the asset and the time value of money.
The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration encompasses the following significant unobservable inputs: Unobservable Inputs Range Estimated contingent consideration payments $3,000 Discount rate 0%-10% Timing of cash flows 1year Probability of achievement 100% Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in operating income in the period of the estimated fair value change. Significant increases or decreases in any of the inputs in isolation may result in a fluctuation in the fair value measurement.
The following table summarizes the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) from November2, 2013 to October31, 2015 : Contingent Consideration Balance as of November 2, 2013 $ 6,479 Contingent consideration liability recorded 1,888 Payment made (1) (4,000 ) Fair value adjustment (2) 439 Balance as of November 1, 2014 $ 4,806 Payment made (1) (2,000 ) Fair value adjustment (2) (137 ) Effect of foreign currency 174 Balance as of October 31, 2015 $ 2,843 (1) The payment is reflected in the statements of cash flows as cash used in financing activities related to the liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and as cash provided by operating activities related to the fair value adjustments previously recognized in earnings.

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis On April4, 2011 , the Company issued the 2016 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October15, 2011 . Based on quotes received from third-party banks, the fair value of the 2016 Notes as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 was $378.6 million and $386.3 million , respectively, and is classified as a Level 1 measurement according to the fair value hierarchy.
On June3, 2013 , the Company issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December1, 2013 . Based on quotes received from third-party banks, the fair value of the 2023 Notes as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 was $480.9 million and $483.5 million , respectively, and is classified as a Level 1 measurement according to the fair value hierarchy.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) k.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets, allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, the net realizable value of inventory, potential reserves relating to litigation matters, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions pertaining to share-based payments and other reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
l.
Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments and trade accounts receivable.
The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments with high credit quality counterparties, continuously monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversifies its investments in order to minimize its credit risk.
The Company sells its products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries including industrial process automation, instrumentation, defense/aerospace, automotive, communications, computers and computer peripherals and consumer electronics. The Company has adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in these markets. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and although the Company generally does not require collateral, the Company may require letters of credit from customers in certain circumstances. The Company provides reserves for estimated amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.
The Company's largest single customer represented approximately 13% of fiscal 2015 revenue. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 revenue.
m.
Concentration of Other Risks The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns. The Companys financial results are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, a large portion of the Companys purchases of external wafer and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If TSMC or any of the Companys other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components, on the time schedule and of the quality that the Company requires, the Company may be forced to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to the Companys customers. Although the Company has experienced shortages of components, materials and external foundry services from time to time, these items have generally been available to the Company as needed.
n.
Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the U.S. and for certain foreign counties. Revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. Accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. For multiple element arrangements, the Company allocates arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. The Company uses its best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.
Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress towards completion. The output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established.
57 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
In all regions of the world, the Company defers revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. As a result, the Companys revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. Sales to distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits, as discussed below, and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by the Company, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of the Companys shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if the Company terminates the relationship with the distributor.
Distributors are granted price-adjustment credits for sales to their customers when the distributors standard cost (i.e., the Companys sales price to the distributor) does not provide the distributor with an appropriate margin on its sales to its customers. As distributors negotiate selling prices with their customers, the final sales price agreed upon with the customer will be influenced by many factors, including the particular product being sold, the quantity ordered, the particular customer, the geographic location of the distributor and the competitive landscape. As a result, the distributor may request and receive a price-adjustment credit from the Company to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on the transaction.
Distributors are also granted price-adjustment credits in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Generally, the Company will provide a credit equal to the difference between the price paid by the distributor (less any prior credits on such products) and the new price for the product multiplied by the quantity of the specific product in the distributors inventory at the time of the price decrease.
Given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. Therefore, the Company defers revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers.
Title to the inventory transfers to the distributor at the time of shipment or delivery to the distributor, and payment from the distributor is due in accordance with the Companys standard payment terms. These payment terms are not contingent upon the distributors sale of the products to their customers. Upon title transfer to distributors, inventory is reduced for the cost of goods shipped, the margin (sales less cost of sales) is recorded as deferred income on shipments to distributors, net and an account receivable is recorded. Shipping costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.
The deferred costs of sales to distributors have historically had very little risk of impairment due to the margins the Company earns on sales of its products and the relatively long life-cycle of the Companys products. Product returns from distributors that are ultimately scrapped have historically been immaterial. In addition, price protection and price-adjustment credits granted to distributors historically have not exceeded the margins the Company earns on sales of its products. The Company continuously monitors the level and nature of product returns and is in frequent contact with the distributors to ensure reserves are established for all known material issues.
As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the Company had gross deferred revenue of $379.9 million and $349.7 million , respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $79.8 million and $71.3 million , respectively. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher demand for products sold into the channel.
The Company generally offers a twelve -month warranty for its products. The Companys warranty policy provides for replacement of defective products. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Product warranty expenses during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were not material .

Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally, deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current and non-current amounts based on the classification of the related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. In calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the average market price for the respective period. In addition, the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average unrecognized compensation expense of stock options that are in-the-money and restricted stock units. This results in the assumed buyback of additional shares, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of in-the-money stock options. Potential shares related to certain of the Companys outstanding stock options were excluded because they were anti-dilutive. Those potential shares, determined based on the weighted average exercise prices during the respective years, related to the Companys outstanding stock options could be dilutive in the future.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 2015 2014 2013 Net Income $ 696,878 $ 629,320 $ 673,487 Basic shares: Weighted average shares outstanding 312,660 313,195 307,763 Earnings per share basic $ 2.23 $ 2.01 $ 2.19 Diluted shares: Weighted average shares outstanding 312,660 313,195 307,763 Assumed exercise of common stock equivalents 4,212 4,832 6,278 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares 316,872 318,027 314,041 Earnings per share diluted $ 2.20 $ 1.98 $ 2.14 Anti-dilutive shares related to: Outstanding stock options 2,089 2,911 4,116 s.
Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the grant-date fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest, and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. In addition to restricted stock units with a service condition, the Company grants restricted stock units with both a market condition and a service condition (market-based restricted stock units). The number of shares of the Company's common stock to be issued upon vesting of market-based restricted stock units will range from 0% to 200% of the target amount, based on the comparison of the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) to the median TSR of a specified peer group over a three-year period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid during the performance period. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded for stock options and market-based restricted stock units requires the Company to develop estimates used in calculating the grant-date fair value of awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards and the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the grant-date fair value of market-based restricted stock units. The use of these valuation models requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected 60 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

New Accounting Pronouncements Standards Implemented Income Taxes In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11). ASU 2013-11 requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. ASU 2013-11 was effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The adoption of ASU 2013-11 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 did not impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Standards to be Implemented Business combinations In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805):Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (ASU 2015-16). The update requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the financial statements of the period in which adjustments to provisional amounts are determined, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The new standard is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.The Company will adopt ASU 2015-16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and is currently evaluating the impact, if any, adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations.
Inventory In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11) , which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method. The guidance in ASU 2015-11 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2015-11 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact, if any, adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations.
Compensation - Retirement Benefits In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employers Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets (ASU 2015-04) , which provides a practical expedient for entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end, that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entitys fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently from year to year. Entities are required to disclose the accounting policy election and the date used to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations. ASU 2015-04 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. Amendments should be applied prospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Interest - Imputation of Interest In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Consolidation In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (ASU 2015-02). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Stock Compensation I n June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (ASU 2014-12) , which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year, as a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein, which is the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The guidance allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
Discontinued Operations In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08), which raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, a disposal representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys financial results or a business activity classified as held for sale, should be reported as discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 also expands the disclosure requirements for discontinued operations and adds new disclosures for individually significant dispositions that do not qualify as discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014, which is the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in the financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. As of October31, 2015 , there have been no disposals or classifications as held for sale that would be subject to ASU 2014-08. As such, the Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 3. Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders Equity Equity Compensation Plans The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other stock and stock-based awards under the Company's Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (2006 Plan). This plan was originally approved by shareholders on March14, 2006, and shareholders subsequently approved the amended and restated 2006 Plan in March 2014. The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of up to 34 million shares of the Companys common stock, plus such number of additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under the Companys previous equity compensation plans that have not been issued because the applicable option award subsequently terminates or expires without being exercised. The 2006 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. Employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted awards under the 2006 Plan. No award may be made under the 2006 Plan after March12, 2021, but awards previously granted may extend beyond that date. The Company will not grant further equity awards under any previous equity compensation plans.
While the Company may grant to employees options that become exercisable at different times or within different periods, the Company has generally granted to employees options that vest over five years and become exercisable in annual installments of 20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. The maximum contractual term of all options is ten years . In addition, the Company has granted to employees restricted stock units that generally vest in one installment on the third anniversary of the grant date.
As of October31, 2015 , a total of 17.0 million common shares were available for future grant under the 2006 Plan and 31.9 million common shares were reserved for issuance under the 2006 Plan and the Company's previous equity compensation plans.
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the grant-date fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest, and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock units. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires the Company to develop estimates used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options.
Hittite Replacement Awards In connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued equity awards to certain Hittite employees in replacement of Hittite equity awards that were canceled at closing. The replacement awards consisted of approximately 0.7 million restricted stock units with a weighted average grant date fair value of $48.20 . The terms and intrinsic value of these awards were substantially the same as the canceled Hittite awards. The fair value of the replaced awards associated with services rendered through the date of Acquisition was recognized as a component of the total estimated acquisition consideration, and the remaining fair value of the replaced awards associated with post Acquisition services will be recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period.
Modification of Awards The Company has from time to time modified the terms of its equity awards to employees and directors. The modifications made to the Companys equity awards in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 did not result in significant incremental compensation costs, either individually or in the aggregate.
Grant-Date Fair Value The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards and the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the grant-date fair value of market-based restricted stock units. The use of these valuation models requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rates. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with only a service condition represents the value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company's common stock prior to vesting.
Information pertaining to the Companys stock option awards and the related estimated weighted-average assumptions to calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model granted is as follows: 63 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.

The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. Information pertaining to the Company's market-based restricted stock units and the related estimated assumptions used to calculate the fair value of market-based restricted stock units granted using the Monte Carlo simulation model is as follows: Market-based Restricted Stock Units 2015 2014 Units granted (in thousands) 75 86 Grant-date fair value $55.67 $50.79 Assumptions: Historical stock price volatility 20.0 % 23.2 % Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 0.8 % Expected dividend yield 2.8 % 2.8 % Market-based restricted stock units were not granted during fiscal 2013 .
Expected volatility The Company is responsible for estimating volatility and has considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates. The Company currently believes that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, the Company concluded that: (1)options in the Companys common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2)the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3)the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4)the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year.  The Company utilizes historical volatility as an input variable of the Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the grant date fair value of market-based restricted stock units. The market performance measure of these awards is based upon the interaction of multiple peer companies. Given the Company is required to use consistent statistical properties in the Monte Carlo simulation and implied volatility is not available across the population, historical volatility must be used.
Expected term The Company uses historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The Company believes that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally its employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.
Risk-free interest rate The yield on zero-coupon U.S.Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.
Expected dividend yield Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the Companys Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant. Until such time as the Companys Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current 64 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock or restricted stock units.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. Based on an analysis of its historical forfeitures, the Company has applied an annual forfeiture rate of 4.7% to all unvested stock-based awards as of October31, 2015 . This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those options that vest.
Additional paid-in-capital (APIC) Pool The APIC pool represents the excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation that are available to absorb future tax deficiencies. If the amount of future tax deficiencies is greater than the available APIC pool, the Company records the excess as income tax expense in its consolidated statements of income. For fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, the Company had a sufficient APIC pool to cover any tax deficiencies recorded and as a result, these deficiencies did not affect its results of operations. During fiscal 2013 , the Company recognized an immaterial amount of income tax expense resulting from tax shortfalls related to share-based compensation in its consolidated statements of income.

That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years. The total grant-date fair value of shares that vested during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was approximately $65.6 million , $57.4 million and $63.9 million , respectively.
Common Stock Repurchase Program The Companys common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004 . In the aggregate, the Board of Directors have authorized the Company to repurchase $5.6 billion of the Companys common stock under the program. Under the program, the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Companys Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when the Company has repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October31, 2015 , the Company had repurchased a total of approximately 140.7 million shares of its common stock for approximately $5.0 billion under this program. An additional $544.5 million remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. The Company also, from time to time, repurchases shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options.  The withholding amount is based on the employees minimum statutory withholding requirement. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the Company's financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash the Company has available in the United States.
Preferred Stock The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred stock at the time of issuance.

Industry, Segment and Geographic Information The Company operates and tracks its results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of integrated circuits (ICs). The Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Company has determined that all of the Company's operating segments share the following similar economic characteristics, and therefore meet the criteria established for operating segments to be aggregated into one reportable segment, namely:  The primary source of revenue for each operating segment is the sale of integrated circuits.
The integrated circuits sold by each of the Company's operating segments are manufactured using similar semiconductor manufacturing processes and raw materials in either the Companys own production facilities or by third-party wafer fabricators using proprietary processes.
The Company sells its products to tens of thousands of customers worldwide.  Many of these customers use products spanning all operating segments in a wide range of applications.
The integrated circuits marketed by each of the Company's operating segments are sold globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website to the same types of customers.
All of the Company's operating segments share a similar long-term financial model as they have similar economic characteristics. The causes for variation in operating and financial performance are the same among the Company's operating segments and include factors such as (i) life cycle and price and cost fluctuations, (ii) number of competitors, (iii) product differentiation and (iv) size of market opportunity. Additionally, each operating segment is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Lastly, the number and composition of employees and the amounts and types of tools and materials required for production of products are similar for each operating segment.

The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which the Companys product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, the Company reclassifies revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

Acquisitions Hittite Microwave Corporation On July22, 2014 , the Company completed its acquisition of Hittite, a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits, modules, subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency, microwave and millimeterwave applications.  The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately $2.4 billion , financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion .  The Acquisition is expected to expand the Companys technology position in high performance signal processing solutions and drive growth in key markets. The Company completed the Acquisition through a cash tender offer (the Offer) by BBAC Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Hittite at a purchase price of $78.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.

The replacement awards consisted of approximately 0.7 million restricted stock units with a weighted average grant date fair value of $48.20 .  The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units represents the value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Companys common stock prior to vesting.  The terms and the intrinsic value of these awards were substantially the same as the canceled Hittite awards. The $6.5 million noted in the table above represents the portion of the fair value of the replacement awards associated with services rendered though the Acquisition Date and have been included as a component of the total estimated purchase price.
During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the acquisition accounting for the Acquisition.

Future technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill because they are part of future development and growth of the business.
There were no significant contingencies assumed as part of the Acquisition.
The Company recognized $50.9 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting, severance, debt financing, interest and other related fees, of which approximately $9.7 million and $41.2 million were expensed in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively.  Approximately $9.7 million of these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2015. Approximately $33.3 million of these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income in operating expenses within SMG&A expenses for fiscal 2014, and approximately $7.9 million of these costs are included in the consolidated statements of income within nonoperating expenses for fiscal 2014.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presents the Company's combined results of operations after giving effect to the Acquisition and assumes that the Acquisition, which closed on July22, 2014 , was completed on November 4, 2012 (the first day of the Companys fiscal 2013).  The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying the Companys accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, transaction-related costs, a step-up in the value of acquired inventory and property, plant and equipment, and interest expense for the debt incurred to fund the Acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Assumptions The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S.defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within the various countries. The projected benefit obligation was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions: 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.64 % 2.95 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.05 % 2.77 % Net annual periodic pension cost was determined using the following weighted average assumptions: 2015 2014 Discount rate 2.95 % 4.05 % Expected long-term return on plan assets 5.80 % 5.46 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 2.77 % 2.84 % The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a weighted-average of the long-term rates of return selected for the various countries where the Company has funded pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is selected based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of plan assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries, reviewed anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset categories and considered the asset allocation strategy adopted by the Company and/or the trustees of the plans. While the review considered recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term prospective rate.
The Companys investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Accordingly, in order to maximize the return on assets, a majority of assets are invested in equities. Investments within each asset class are diversified to reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and asset class targets.
The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.

The state credit carryover of $64.8 million will begin to expire in 2016.
As of October31, 2015 , the Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3.1 million to offset future passive income.  If not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2019 and 2023.
The Company has provided for potential tax liabilities due in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide income tax expense provision. In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities. Although the Company believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on the Companys income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
As of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the Company had a liability of $75.3 million and $63.0 million , respectively, for unrealized tax benefits, all of which, if settled in the Companys favor, would lower the Companys effective tax rate in the period recorded. In addition, as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 , the Company had a liability of approximately $16.1 million and $12.0 million , respectively, for interest and penalties. The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of income. The total liability as of October31, 2015 and November1, 2014 of $81.0 million and $70.6 million , respectively, for uncertain tax positions is classified as non-current, and is included in other non-current liabilities, because the Company believes that the ultimate payment or settlement of these liabilities may not occur within the next twelve months. The consolidated statements of income for fiscal year 2015 , fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 include $4.1 million , $1.9 million and $7.1 million , respectively, of interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Over the next fiscal year, the Company anticipates the liability to be reduced by $1.3 million for the possible expiration of an income tax statute of limitations.

The potential liability for this adjustment is $36.5 million . On September 18, 2013, in a matter not involving the Company, the U.S. Tax Court held that accounts receivable created under Rev. Proc. 99-32 may constitute indebtedness for purposes of Section 965 (b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and that the IRS was not precluded from reducing the beneficial dividend received deduction because of the increase in related-party indebtedness (BMC Software Inc. v Commissioner, 141 T.C. No. 5 2013). After analyzing the Tax Courts decision, the Company has determined that its tax position with respect to the Section 965(b)(3) no longer meets the more likely than not standard of recognition for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $36.5 million reserve for this matter in the fourth quarter of 2013.
All of the Company's U.S. federal tax returns prior to fiscal 2012 are no longer subject to examination.
All of the Company's Ireland tax returns prior to fiscal 2011 are no longer subject to examination.

Revolving Credit Facility On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a five-year, $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders (the Credit Agreement). On July 10, 2015 , the Company amended and restated the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement expires on July 10, 2020 and provides that the Company may borrow up to $750.0 million . To date, the Company has not borrowed under this credit facility but the Company may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a rate equal to (a) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin based on the Company's debt rating or (b) the Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Bank of America prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus .50% or (iii) one month Eurodollar Rate plus a margin based on the Company's debt rating. The terms of the facility impose restrictions on the Companys ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.0 to 1.0 . As of October31, 2015 , the Company was compliant with these covenants .
16.
Debt On June30, 2009 , the Company issued $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July1, 2014 (the 2014 Notes) with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing January1, 2010 . The sale of the 2014 Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement dated, June25, 2009 between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named therein. The net proceeds of the offering were $370.4 million , after issuing at a discount and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions, which were amortized over the term of the 2014 Notes.
On June30, 2009 , the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions related to its outstanding 2014 Notes where the Company swapped the notional amount of its $375.0 million of fixed rate debt at 5.0% into floating interest rate debt through July1, 2014 . The Company designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps in other assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value 79 ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. In fiscal 2012, the Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement. The Company received $19.8 million in cash proceeds from the swap termination, which included $1.3 million in accrued interest. The proceeds, net of interest received, are disclosed in cash flows from financing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of the termination, the carrying value of the 2014 Notes was adjusted for the change in the fair value of the interest component of the debt up to the date of the termination of the swap in an amount equal to the fair value of the swap, and was amortized into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. During fiscal 2012, $5.3 million was amortized into earnings as a reduction of interest expense related to the swap termination. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, in conjunction with the redemption of the 2014 Notes, the Company recognized the remaining $8.6 million in unamortized proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap as other, net, within non-operating (income) expense.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company redeemed its outstanding 2014 Notes.  The redemption price was 104.744% of the principal amount of the 2014 Notes.  In accordance with the applicable guidance, the Company concluded that the debt transaction qualified as a debt extinguishment and as a result recognized a net loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $10.2 million recorded in other, net within non-operating (income) expense.  This loss was comprised of the make-whole premium of $17.8 million paid to bondholders on the 2014 Notes in accordance with the terms of the notes, the recognition of the remaining $8.6 million of unamortized proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap associated with the debt, and the write-off of approximately $1.0 million of debt issuance and discount costs that remained to be amortized. The write-off of the remaining unamortized portion of debt issuance costs, discount and swap proceeds are reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities, and the make-whole premium is reflected within financing activities.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable.
ITEM 9A.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Analogs disclosure controls and procedures as of October31, 2015 . The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October31, 2015 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October31, 2015 . In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated 2013 Framework.
Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of October31, 2015 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.
(1) (c) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 83 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Analog Devices, Inc.
We have audited Analog Devices, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). Analog Devices, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Analog Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Analog Devices, Inc.  as of October 31, 2015 and November 1, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2015 of Analog Devices, Inc. and our report dated November 24, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts November 24, 2015 84 (d) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
