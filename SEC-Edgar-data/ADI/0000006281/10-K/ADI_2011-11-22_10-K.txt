We produce a wide range of products that meet the technology needs of a broad base of customers and markets. Markets and applications for our products include communications, computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics, industrial, instrumentation, military and space systems and automotive electronics.
During fiscal 2001, approximately 38% of our revenues came from the communications market. Over the past few years, this market has been our fastest-growing served market. Communications applications include wireless handsets and base stations, as well as products used for high-speed access to the Internet, including ICs used in ADSL and cable modems and central office networking equipment.
We serve the PC market with products that monitor and manage power usage, process signals used in flat panel displays and multimedia projectors and enable PCs to provide CD-quality audio. We also serve the high-end consumer market with ICs used in products such as digital cameras and camcorders, DVD players and surround sound audio systems. During fiscal 2001, approximately 22% of our revenues were derived from the computer and consumer markets.
We serve the industrial market by providing products for data acquisition systems, automatic process control systems, robotics, environmental control systems and automatic test equipment. We also provide products to the instrumentation market for use in engineering, medical and scientific instruments. During fiscal 2001, approximately 40% of our revenue came from the industrial market.
We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force, third-party industrial distributors and independent sales representatives. We have direct sales offices in 19 countries, including the United States.
We are headquartered near Boston, in Norwood, Massachusetts, and have manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. Founded in 1965, we employ approximately 9,000 people worldwide. Our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ADI and is included in the Standard & Poors 500 Index.
Industry Background Real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound, images, speed and acceleration, are analog by nature, consisting of continuously varying information. This information can be detected and measured using analog sensors, which represent real-world phenomena by generating continuously varying voltages and currents. The signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods, such as amplification, filtering and shaping. They are then usually converted to digital form for storage, display or further manipulation. The further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called digital signal processing, or DSP. Digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as analog display, audio output or control. These manipulations and transformations along this signal chain are collectively known as real-world signal processing.
Significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of ICs used in signal processing applications. These advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip, thereby making possible much more highly integrated solutions. The convergence of computing and communications requires end products that incorporate state-of-the-art signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible. Our products are used as components in equipment and systems to achieve higher performance, including greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal processing, and minimized power consumption.
1 Table of Contents Principal Products We are engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of a broad line of high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies that address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. We produce and market several thousand products. Our highest revenue product accounted for approximately 2% of our revenue for fiscal 2001. Many of our products are proprietary and equivalent products are available only from a limited number of other suppliers. We also design, manufacture and market a limited range of assembled products.
Markets and Applications The following describes some of the characteristics of, and products supplied to, each of our major markets: Communications The development of broadband, wireless and Internet infrastructures around the world has created an important market for our communications products. Communications technology involves the acquisition of analog signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form as they are processed and transmitted. Our expertise in combining analog and digital functionality on a single chip or chip set has enabled us to develop products that fulfill the technological challenges of this complex and rapidly expanding market space. The need for ever higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable, more bandwidth-efficient communications, is creating increasing demand for our products, which are used in systems that include digital, analog and mixed-signal processing capability. Our products are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for audio, data, image or video communication. In broadband and wireless communication applications, our products are incorporated into data and digital subscriber line (DSL)modems, cellular telephones, base station equipment and remote access servers. We are also developing micromachined products for use in optical networks.
Computers and Computer Peripherals Increased interface between users and PCs through monitors, printers, scanners and audio devices and the increasing need for power and thermal management capability in PCs have provided many opportunities in the computer market. Our ability to integrate analog, DSP and mixed-signal functionality on ICs has enabled us to supply many high performance critical components required by PCmanufacturers. The computer industry seeks to develop and market ever smaller and lighter personal computers. This need increases demand for high performance ICs to monitor power usage to enable manufacturers to use smaller batteries and extend battery life between charges. We currently supply a variety of ICs used in this market for functions such as graphic displays, interfaces between PCs and peripherals such as modems and printers, power and battery management, and enhanced audio input and output capability for business and entertainment applications.
Consumer Electronics Increased market demand for acquisition, display and digital processing of signals has allowed us to combine analog and digital design capability to provide solutions that meet the rigorous cost, size and reliability constraints of the consumer electronics market. The emergence of high-performance feature-rich consumer products, such as home sound systems, video projectors, DVD players and digital camcorders and cameras, has led to the need for high-performance system-level ICs with a high level of specific functionality.
Industrial Our industrial market includes data acquisition systems, automatic process control systems, robotics, environmental control systems and automatic test equipment. These products generally require ICs that offer performance greater than that available from commodity-level ICs, but generally do not have production volumes that warrant custom or application-specific ICs. Combinations of analog and mixed-signal ICs are usually employed to achieve the necessary functionality. Automatic test equipment applications have created opportunities for the design of system-level ICs that require a high level of electronic circuitry.
Instrumentation Our instrumentation market includes engineering, medical and scientific instruments. These products are usually designed using the highest performance analog and mixed-signal ICs available. Production volumes in this space generally do not warrant custom or application-specific ICs.
2 Table of Contents Military/ Aerospace The military, commercial avionics and space markets all require high-performance ICs that meet rigorous environmental and reliability specifications. Nearly all of our analog ICs can be supplied in versions that meet appropriate military standards. In addition, many products can be supplied to meet the standards required for broadcast satellites and other commercial space applications. Most of our products sold in this market are derived from standard commercial grade ICs.
Automotive Although the automotive market has historically been served with low-cost, low-performance ICs, demand has emerged for higher performance devices for a wide range of applications. In response, we are developing products specifically for the automotive market. We supply a micromachined IC used as a crash sensor in airbag systems, which serves as an alternative to an electromechanical sensor. We believe that other micromachined devices derived from this product may be suitable for other automotive applications, such as roll-over sensing, global positioning satellite (GPS)automotive navigation systems, anti-lock brakes and smart suspension systems and non-automotive applications including earthquake detectors and high-end computer joysticks.
Research and Development Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and processes, and for significant improvement of existing products and processes. We spent $465million during fiscal 2001 related to the design, development and improvement of new and existing products and processes, compared to $390million spent during fiscal 2000 and $253million spent during fiscal 1999.
In support of our research and development activities, we employ hundreds of engineers involved in product and process development at several design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world.
As of November3, 2001, we owned approximately 662 U.S.patents and had 318patent applications on file with the United States patent office. We believe that while our patents may provide some advantage, our competitive position is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, the range and number of new products being developed, our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts, customer service and technical support.
IC Products Analog Products Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business for more than 25years, and we believe we are one of the worlds largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our analog ICs are primarily high-performance, single-function devices. The majority of our analog IC product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters (analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog) and amplifiers. Other analog IC products we offer include analog signal processing devices (such as analog multipliers), voltage references and comparators. Over the past few years we have been expanding our analog IC product offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas where our focus was previously limited, principally interface circuits and power management ICs. We are also expanding our analog IC product line to better meet the needs of customers designing portable battery-operated equipment.
Our analog IC products tend to be general purpose in nature. This allows customers to incorporate them into a wide variety of equipment and systems. Our product portfolio includes several hundred analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who build equipment for their own use. Most of our analog ICs have been purchased by OEMs to serve the instrumentation, industrial and military/ aerospace markets, but during the past few years they have been increasingly used for applications in communications, computers, camcorders, scanners, automatic test equipment, imaging and other consumer applications requiring high-performance real-world signal processing. By using standard, high-performance, readily available, off-the-shelf components in their designs, our 3 Table of Contents customers can reduce the time they need to develop and bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing customized ICs, analog ICs usually provide the most cost-effective solution for low to medium volume applications. In addition, combinations of analog ICs connected together on a printed circuit board can provide functionality not currently achievable using a single IC.
Other analog ICs include circuits that are designed to serve the needs of particularly demanding applications, such as very high speed analog timing and pin driver circuits needed by OEMs in the automatic test equipment business. Manufacturers of portable instrumentation need analog ICs designed to address demanding battery life requirements, and need similar kinds of functions available in analog IC products integrated into a single, very low-power chip. Other principal requirements include higher accuracy, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower weight and fewer components for improved reliability. These application-specific products allow our customers to design smaller, lighter, higher performance, more power-efficient and lower-cost end products. We believe that these benefits have become more important to our OEM customers as they increase their focus on high-performance, small, lightweight products, many of which are battery-powered.
General Purpose DSP Products Our DSP products are designed to efficiently execute specialized software programs (algorithms)associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. General-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software tools that we provide and software tools they obtain from third-party suppliers. All of these devices share a common architecture that allows system designers to address cost, performance and time-to-market constraints. We support these products with specialized applications and easy-to-use, low-cost design tools, which reduce product development costs and time to market.
Mixed-Signal Products Our products also include multi-function mixed-signal devices that incorporate combinations of analog and digital technology. The growing need to allow user interface with computers and consumer products as well as the development of communications systems has created new opportunities for these mixed-signal devices. Examples of these devices include chipsets for communication applications (GSM cellular phones, remote access servers, data and fax modems), audio input/output devices and power and thermal management devices for computer applications and electric motor control devices.
Micromachined Products Our technology base includes a number of new products using an advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface micromachining. This technology enables extremely small mechanical structures to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry. In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical structure, these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the micromachined sensing element.
Our micromachined products are accelerometers used in a wide variety of applications. The majority of current revenue from micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications. Emerging applications include GPSautomobile navigation systems, earthquake detectors and high-end computer joysticks. We are also engaged in the development of micromachined products for use in all-optical switching elements in optical networks.
General Purpose and Custom Products Across the entire range of ICs that we design and manufacture are general purpose products as well as custom products designed for specific applications for specific customers. In many of the new emerging markets in communications, computer and consumer products, there is a tendency to work with selected major customers to design application-specific solutions which can combine elements of analog, digital, mixed-signal and micromachined functionality.
4 Table of Contents Assembled Products Our assembled products include multi-chip modules (MCMs), hybrids and printed circuit board modules. An MCM is a device made up of several IC chips assembled in an automated fashion in a multilayer package that provides high interconnect density at low cost. A hybrid consists of several chips and discrete components mounted and wired together on a substrate, which is then enclosed in a package. A printed-board module consists of surface-mount components assembled on a small printed board that is then encapsulated in a small plastic case.
Revenues from this product group have been declining for several years, primarily because hybrids are being replaced in many new designs with smaller, lower-cost monolithic ICs that offer higher levels of performance and integration. Sales of these products are approximately 3% of our total sales.
Sales Channels We sell our products in North America and internationally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors and independent sales representatives. Approximately 39% of our fiscal 2001 net sales were to customers in North America. As of December1, 2001, we had 12 sales offices in the United States, and our third-party distribution channel consisted of six national and regional third-party distributors and several independent sales representatives in numerous locations throughout the U.S. and Canada.
Approximately 24% of our fiscal 2001 net sales were to customers in Europe, 15% to customers in Japan, and 22% to customers in other international markets. As of December1, 2001, we had direct sales offices in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We also had sales representatives and/or distributors in approximately 46countries outside North America, including countries where we also have direct sales offices. For further detail regarding geographic information, see Note 4 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this report.
A significant portion of our fiscal 2001 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors. These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell products competitive with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and products that are slow-moving or that we have discontinued.
Our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute full-length databooks, short-form catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products. We also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide web site on the Internet. We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products during their product development cycles.
For fiscal 2001, our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales. The largest single customer represented approximately 3% of net sales.
Production and Raw Materials Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual chips (or dice), assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form. The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious metals, ceramic packages and plastic used for packaging.
We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and system-level ICs. We also use industry-standard bipolar and CMOS wafer fabrication processes.
5 Table of Contents Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. We rely primarily on our own facilities for fabricating wafers that require linear and mixed-signal processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, California; Belfast, Northern Ireland and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate assembly and test facilities located in Ireland, the Philippines and Taiwan and also use third-party subcontractors. We have agreements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, (TSMC), and Chartered Semiconductor ManufacturingPte., Ltd., (CSM), for the production of digital and very large scale integration mixed-signal devices. To provide access to advanced process technology at competitive costs, we participated in the formation of a joint venture (WaferTech, LLC) with TSMC, Altera, Integrated Silicon Solutions and several individual investors that built a fabrication facility for eight-inch wafers in Camas, Washington. Originally we had an 18% equity ownership in WaferTech. In fiscal 1999, we sold 78% of our investment to other WaferTech partners in exchange for $105million in cash, which was equal to 78% of the carrying value of the equity ownership at October31, 1998. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in WaferTech, LLC to TSMC for approximately $61million in cash. We recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately $28million.
Hybrid products are manufactured by mounting and connecting together several integrated circuit chips in a single package. We manufacture some of the chips used in our hybrids, and purchase others from outside suppliers. The production process for modular components, subsystems and systems consists primarily of assembly, packaging and testing. Some of our assembled products are assembled and tested within our U.S. manufacturing facilities and at U.S. subcontractors, while others are assembled and tested at our facilities outside the United States or by subcontractors, principally in the Far East.
To respond to production capacity requirements, we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity over the past several years. Major wafer fabrication expansions were completed in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Sunnyvale, California, and Limerick, Ireland. In fiscal 2001, we completed construction of an additional assembly and test facility in Cavite, Philippines. We expect that our capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 will be approximately $70million compared to $297million in fiscal 2001.
Backlog Backlog at the end of fiscal 2001 was approximately $210million, down from approximately $1,062million at the end of fiscal 2000. We define backlog as firm orders with a customer requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. While backlog has declined primarily as a result of the lower demand for our products from the year earlier period, it has also been impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenues.
Government Contracts We estimate that approximately 4% of our fiscal 2001 total worldwide revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S.government and government contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm fixed-price subcontracts. All such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the United States government.
Competition We compete with a large number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive. We believe we are one of the largest suppliers of high-performance linear and mixed-signal signal-processing components. Competitors for our analog, mixed-signal and DSP products include Cirrus Logic Inc., Linear Technology Corp., Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Motorola Semiconductor Products, National Semiconductor Corp., Phillips Semiconductor, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments, Inc. Sales of our 6 Table of Contents micromachined products are currently comprised of acceleration sensors, and our main competitors are Bosch, Motorola and Denso, which use a multichip solution. We use a single chip solution that we believe provides cost, reliability and functional advantages in the marketplace.
Many other companies offer products that compete with our products. Some also offer other electronic products, and some have financial resources substantially larger than ours. Also, some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies.
We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for real-world signal-processing components depends upon several factors, including product price, technical innovation, product quality and reliability, range of products, customer service and technical support. We believe our aggressive technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support, enables us to continue to compete successfully in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers.
Environment Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Employees As of November3, 2001, we employed approximately 9,000 persons. Our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes. The competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that relations with our employees are good.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 	FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Net sales were $2,277million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of 12% from net sales of $2,578million in fiscal 2000. The decrease in net sales was attributable to declining demand in several markets that we serve, particularly the communications market, as well as an overall decline in the general economy. Fiscal 2001 analog IC product sales decreased 3% from fiscal 2000. Our analog IC product sales were strong in the first half of the year and declined in line with a major downturn in the semiconductor industry that occurred during the last half of fiscal 2001. Our fiscal 2001 DSP IC product sales decreased 32% from the prior year due to order cancellations and adjustments, particularly from telecommunications customers and contract manufacturers. Sales of new products, which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters, were 19% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared with 25% in fiscal 2000. The year over year decrease in new products as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the sharp downturn in sales of our communications products.
Net sales were $2,578million in fiscal 2000, an increase of 78% over net sales of $1,450million in fiscal 1999. This increase in net sales was attributable to continued growth in the markets we serve. Sales into all end markets increased in fiscal 2000 with the communications market representing the largest growth area.
The percentage of sales by geographic region for the last three years is as follows: Region Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 Fiscal 1999 North America 39 % 45 % 46 % Europe 24 % 19 % 22 % Japan 15 % 14 % 14 % Southeast Asia 22 % 22 % 18 % As set forth above, the fiscal 2001 decline in North American sales as a percentage of total sales was principally attributable to an overall decline in the communications market as well as a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry. Sales to international regions remained strong in the first half of fiscal 2001 but weakened in the latter half of the year due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry. In absolute dollar terms, sales to Europe increased by 10% in fiscal 2001. Sales in fiscal 2001 to Japan remained relatively flat to fiscal 2000 as both a percentage of sales and in absolute dollar terms. Fiscal 2001 sales to Southeast Asia remained flat as a percentage of sales as compared to fiscal 2000 while declining approximately 13% in absolute dollars. In fiscal 2000, sales to Europe declined as a percentage of total sales largely due to a weakening Euro/ U.S. dollar exchange rate over fiscal 1999. In absolute dollars, fiscal 2000 net sales increased over fiscal 1999 by 72% in North America, 61% in Europe, 75% in Japan and 114% in Southeast Asia. These large sales increases were due to high growth in end market demand that was not sustainable.
Gross margin was $1,269million, or 55.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 compared to $1,461million, or 56.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. Gross margin declined by 100 basis points from the prior year due to reduced revenue levels, the impact of inventory reserves and low utilization of our internal fabs. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2000 to 56.7% from the 49.3% achieved in fiscal 1999 was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs being allocated across a higher sales base and improved manufacturing efficiencies as production increased at our wafer fabrication, assembly and test facilities. Gross margin declined to 52% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of a 47% sales decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.
Research and development (R&D) expense amounted to $465million in fiscal 2001, an increase of $75million over fiscal 2000. Additional expenses associated with increased engineering headcount were the main reason for the year over year increase. As a result of the decline in the year to year revenue, R&D spending as a percentage of sales increased to 20.4% from 15.1% in fiscal 2000. At any point in time we have hundreds of R&D projects underway, and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product 13 Table of Contents leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore we expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. In fiscal 2000, R&D expense increased to $390million from $253million in fiscal 1999.
Amortization of intangibles was $53million for fiscal 2001 compared with $11million for fiscal 2000. The increase in amortization expense was attributable to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of BCOTechnologies plc in the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the acquisition of Thomas NeurothAG, Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., Integrated Micro Instruments, Inc., ChipLogic, Inc. and Staccato Systems, Inc. completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2001.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the following acquisitions: Maximum Purchase Contingent Acquired Company Price Consideration Thomas Neuroth AG (Neuroth) $ 4,500,000 $ 4,000,000 Signal Processing Associates Pty. Ltd. (SPA) 3,800,000 500,000 Integrated Micro Instruments (IMI) 1,900,000 2,700,000 ChipLogic, Inc. (ChipLogic) 68,300,000 29,000,000 Staccato Systems, Inc. (Staccato) 23,800,000 7,000,000  On October31, 2000, we acquired Thomas 	NeurothAG (Neuroth) of Vienna, Austria for approximately 	$4.5million in cash, with additional contingent cash 	consideration of up to $4million payable if certain 	operational objectives are achieved. As of November3, 	2001, $1million of the contingent consideration has been 	paid and charged to operations. The remaining $3million of 	contingent consideration will be accounted for as goodwill. 	Neuroth is a developer of highly integrated circuits for 	symmetric DSL broadband access.
On November10, 2000, we acquired Signal 	Processing Associates Pty. Ltd., (SPA)of Victoria, 	Australia for approximately $3.8million in cash, with 	additional contingent cash consideration of up to 	$0.5million payable if certain operation objectives are 	achieved. The contingent consideration will be recorded as 	compensation expense. SPA is a developer and supplier of voice 	processing and fax/data relay software for telecommunications 	applications.
On December18, 2000, we acquired Integrated 	Micro Instruments, Inc. (IMI)of Berkeley, California for 	approximately $1.1million in cash and 13,750shares 	of our common stock valued at approximately $0.8million. 	An additional 50,000shares of common stock valued at a 	fixed amount of approximately $2.7million are issuable 	over the next five years upon the satisfaction of certain 	conditions. The contingent consideration will be recorded as 	compensation expense. IMI develops MEMS process designs.
On January4, 2001, we acquired ChipLogic, 	Inc. (ChipLogic) of Santa Clara, California. The total purchase 	price of $68.3million consisted of cash of approximately 	$4million, approximately 1million shares of our 	common stock valued at $60.2million and the assumption of 	$4.1million of outstanding ChipLogic stock options. 	Approximately $9.5million represented the purchase price 	of in-process technology that had not yet reached technological 	feasibility, had no alternative future use and was charged to 	operations during fiscal 2001. An additional $8million of 	cash consideration and 489,375shares of common stock is 	due if certain operational objectives are achieved and will be 	accounted for as compensation expense. Of these shares, 249,375 	contingent shares have a fixed value of approximately 	$13million which is being charged to operations over a 	five year period. The remaining 240,000shares are subject 	to performance-based criteria. During fiscal 2001, approximately 	$4.2million of expense was recorded related to the 	issuance of 117,592shares of common stock associated with 	the achievement of certain of these objectives. The remaining 	performance based shares had a value of approximately 	$3.8million as of November3, 2001. To the extent 	that the remaining criteria are met, our stock price at that 	time will be used to measure the amount of compensation expense 	to be recoded. ChipLogic is a developer of high-performance 	integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of 	voice, broadband access and network protocol processing.
14 Table of Contents  On January16, 2001, we acquired Staccato 	Systems, Inc. (Staccato) of Mountain View, California. The total 	purchase price of $23.8million consisted of 	$23million in cash and the assumption of $0.8million 	of outstanding Staccato stock options. Additional contingent 	cash consideration of up to $7million is payable if 	certain operational objectives are achieved and will be 	accounted for as additional goodwill. Approximately 	$1.8million of the contingent consideration has been paid 	as of November3, 2001. Staccato is in the field of audio 	synthesis technology.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we acquired BCOTechnologies plc(BCO), a company with operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a cash-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $163million. BCO is a leading supplier of silicon-on-insulator wafers used for fabricating micromechanical optical devices for optical switching and communications applications. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded approximately $158million of goodwill. There was no in-process research and development write-off related to this acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired two DSP tools companies, White Mountain DSP, Inc. of Nashua, New Hampshire (WM)and Edinburgh Portable Compilers Limited, of Edinburgh, Scotland (EPC). The total cost of these acquisitions was approximately $23million with additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of $10million payable if the acquired companies achieve certain revenue and operational objectives. As of November3, 2001 all of the additional cash consideration has been paid and accounted for as additional purchase price. In connection with the acquisitions of WM and EPC, we recorded a charge of $5.1million for the write-off of in-process research and development.
Selling, marketing, general and administrative (SMG&A) expenses were $287million in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $6million from the $293million in fiscal 2000. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A increased to 12.6% for fiscal 2001 from 11.4% in fiscal 2000 as a result of reduced revenue levels. In fiscal 2000, SMG&A expenses increased $83million from $210million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of sales, SMG&A decreased to 11.4% in fiscal 2000 from 14.5% in fiscal 1999 as a result of increased sales.
During fiscal 2001, we recorded a special charge of approximately $47million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the current economic climate. The actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing, which included a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities. Workforce reductions also occurred, to a lesser extent, in selling, marketing and administrative areas. As of November3, 2001, the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of approximately $30million for approximately 1,200 employees in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Philippines, of which approximately half of these employees were terminated as of November3, 2001. The special charge also included approximately $12million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations. We believe that the workforce reductions will result in annual salary savings of approximately $40million with a $27million reduction in cost of sales and a $13million reduction in operating expenses. The impact in fiscal 2002 of these cost savings is expected to be approximately $30million, with a $20million reduction in cost of sales and a $10million reduction in operating expenses.
Our operating income was $408million, or 17.9% of sales, for fiscal 2001, compared to $767million, or 29.8% of sales, in fiscal 2000 and $243million, or 16.7% of net sales, for fiscal 1999.
In fiscal 1999, we sold 78% of our investment in WaferTech, LLC (WaferTech) to other WaferTech partners in exchange for $105million in cash, which was equal to 78% of the carrying value of the equity ownership at October31, 1998. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed the sale of our remaining investment in WaferTech to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for approximately $61million in cash. We recorded a pretax realized gain on the sale of this investment of approximately $28million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we sold our investment in Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. We received proceeds of approximately $65million in cash and realized a pretax gain of approximately $44million. These realized gains are included in other nonoperating income.
Interest expense was $62million in fiscal 2001 compared to $6million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense was the result of a full year of interest expense on our $1,200million of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Interest income was $133million in fiscal 2001 compared to $63million in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income was due to higher cash 15 Table of Contents balances from increased cash flow as well as the unused portion of the funds obtained from the issuance of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes.
Our effective income tax rate remained relatively flat at 29.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 29.9% for fiscal 2000, primarily due to a shift in the mix of worldwide profits offset by a taxable gain on the sale of our remaining WaferTech investment. Our effective income tax rate increased to 29.9% for fiscal 2000 from 23.6% in fiscal 1999 due to increased profits in higher tax jurisdictions, principally the United States.
Fiscal 2001 net income was $356million, or 15.7% of sales, and diluted earnings per share was $0.93 compared to net income in fiscal 2000 of $607million and diluted earnings per share of $1.59. The fiscal 2001 decrease in net income from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Net income increased to $607million, or 23.6% of sales, in fiscal 2000 from $197million, or 13.6% of sales, in fiscal 1999.
Effective October29, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133, (FAS133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.138, Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. FAS133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such instruments at fair market value. Under certain circumstances, a portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI)until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income immediately. While the adoption of FAS133 on October29, 2000 did not have a material impact on operations, it resulted in a $5million loss recognized in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001.
In August 2001 the Company adopted Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin101, (SAB101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB101 summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No.141, (FAS141), Business Combinations and No.142, (FAS142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. We must adopt these new pronouncements no later than November 2002, with earlier adoption permitted. Application of the non-amortization provisions of FAS142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $54million, beginning in fiscal 2003. We will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 141 and 142 will have on our financial position or results of operations.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.143, (FAS143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It also applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or)the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not believe that the adoption of FAS143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.144, (FAS144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions for 16 Table of Contents the disposal of a segment of a business of APBOpinion No.30, Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. We are required to adopt FAS144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS144 will have on our financial position or results of operations.
The impact of inflation on our business during the past three years has not been significant.
Liquidity and Capital Resources At November3, 2001, we had $2,793million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $2,235million at October28, 2000. The $558million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily due to operating cash inflows of $844million (37% of fiscal 2001 sales) offset by $297million of capital spending. In fiscal 2000, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $1,473million primarily due to operating cash inflows of $705million, or 27% of sales in fiscal 2000, and $1,172million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt offset by $275million of capital spending and $169million of acquisition-related spending. Investing activities used $1,220million in fiscal 2001 and $456million in fiscal 2000, while financing activities generated $2million in fiscal 2001 and $1,130million in fiscal 2000.
Accounts receivable of $218million at the end of fiscal 2001 decreased $246million or 53% from $464million at the end of fiscal 2000. This decrease resulted principally from a $382million decrease in sales from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Days sales outstanding improved from 52days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to 46days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. As a percentage of annualized fourth quarter sales, accounts receivable was 12.9% at the end of fiscal 2001, down from 14.4% at the end of fiscal 2000.
Inventories decreased $85million, or 26%, from fiscal 2000 to $247million at the end of fiscal 2001. Days cost of sales in inventory increased by 21days to 111days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The decrease in inventory in absolute dollar terms is attributable to production decreases in response to reduced demand for our products as well as an increase in inventory reserves and a sharp curtailment of spending on wafers supplied by external foundries. We employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary. While a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory. Although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand, due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results, it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual demand for products is less than our estimates, additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be reflected in future periods.
Net additions to property, plant and equipment of $297million for fiscal 2001 were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Capital spending in fiscal 2001 increased slightly from the $275million incurred in fiscal 2000. Significant fiscal 2001 capital additions included new facilities in Wilmington, MA; Sunnyvale, CA; and Limerick, Ireland. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $70million in fiscal 2002. Depreciation expense is expected to increase to $171million in fiscal 2002 from $158million in fiscal 2001.
We acquired five companies during fiscal 2001, as more fully described in Results of Operations. Total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately $38million.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we issued $1,200million of 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2005 (2005Notes), with semiannual interest payments on April1 and October1 of each year, commencing April1, 2001. The 2005Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased, at a conversion price of $129.78 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The net proceeds of the offering were $1,172million after payment of 17 Table of Contents the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering, which will be amortized over the term of the 2005Notes. After the issuance of the 2005Notes, our debt-to-equity ratio increased to 53%.
At November3, 2001, our principal sources of liquidity were $2,793million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with current and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and research and development efforts for the foreseeable future.
Forward-Looking Statements The Management Analysis and other sections of this report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, managements beliefs and assumptions made by management. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. (See Factors That May Affect Future Results below.) Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results are difficult to 	predict and may materially fluctuate.
Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity, the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our largest customers, changes in product mix, and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times, including the recent decline in demand experienced during fiscal 2001. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.
Our future success depends upon our ability to 	develop and market new products and enter new markets.
Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less well established, which could subject us to increased credit risk.
18 Table of Contents We may not be able to compete successfully in 	the semiconductor industry in the future.
The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. Some of our competitors have greater technical, marketing, manufacturing and financial resources than we do. Our competitors also include emerging companies attempting to sell products to specialized markets that we serve. Our competitors have, in some cases, developed and marketed products having similar design and functionality as our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition.
We may not be able to satisfy increasing 	demand for our products, and increased production may lead to 	overcapacity and lower prices.
The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained or short-term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. We and the semiconductor industry experienced a period of rapid decreases in demand in fiscal 2001. As a result we have overcapacity due to the expansion of our production facilities and increased access to third-party foundries. However, we cannot be sure that we will not encounter unanticipated production problems at either our own facilities or at third-party foundries, or that our capacity will be sufficient to satisfy demand for our products. We believe that other semiconductor manufacturers have expanded their production capacity over the past several years. This expansion by us and our competitors and the continuation of the decline in the demand for semiconductor products that began in early fiscal 2001, has led to overcapacity in our target markets, which has resulted in a year over year decline in our revenue rate and could lead to price erosion that would adversely affect our operating results.
We rely on third-party subcontractors and 	manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers and 	assembly/test services and therefore cannot control their 	availability or conditions of supply.
We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard digital processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs.
Our revenues may not increase enough to offset 	the expense of additional capacity.
Our capacity additions resulted in a significant increase in operating expenses. If revenue levels do not increase enough to offset these additional expense levels, our future operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time.
We rely on manufacturing capacity located in 	geologically unstable areas, which could affect the availability 	of supplies and services.
We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in California and Taiwan as well as wafer fabrication foundries in Taiwan and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment, and availability of key services including transport. In addition, California has recently experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity. To date, the impact on us has been negligible. However, electricity is a critical resource for us, without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions.
We are exposed to economic, political and 	other risks through our significant worldwide 	operations.
During fiscal 2001, 61% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and Taiwan. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the 19 Table of Contents U.S. economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September11, 2001 and the response to them of the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, tax and tariff rates and freight rates, and social and political unrest. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the U.S.dollar against other currencies.
We are involved in frequent litigation 	regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to 	defend and could require us to redesign products or pay 	significant royalties.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim and a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation can be costly and divert the attention of key personnel. See Note10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended November3, 2001 for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.
Leverage and debt service obligations may 	adversely affect our cash flow.
We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. We may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, and other amounts due in respect of, this indebtedness when due. Our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences. This substantial leverage could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It may require the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.
ITEM 7A.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT 	MARKET RISK We have fixed rate debt obligations and interest rate swap and cap agreements. An increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations. Because of the size and structure of these obligations, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not result in a material change in our interest expense or the fair value of the debt obligations and related interest rate swap and cap agreements for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. The fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 due mainly to the short-term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio. The related interest income would change by approximately $6million for each 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates for fiscal 2001 on a weighted average portfolio maturity of 93days. The impact of a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on interest income was not material for fiscal 2000 due mainly to the relative insignificance of interest income to the consolidated pretax income.
As more fully described in Note2 (i)in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts. The terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from three months up to one year. The short-term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000. Currently, our largest foreign currency 20 Table of Contents exposure is against the Euro, primarily because Europe has a higher proportion of local currency denominated expenses. Relative to foreign currency exposures existing at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments, primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year-end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S.dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. Our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.

Summary of Significant Accounting 	Policies a.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The Companys fiscal year ends on the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal year 2001 was a 53-week year, and fiscal years 2000 and 1999 were each 52-week years.
Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2001 presentation, such reclassifications were immaterial.
b.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and 	Investments Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Investments with maturities between three and twelve months at time of acquisition are considered short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper and government agency discount notes, but also include certificates of deposit, bank time deposits, institutional money market funds and bankers acceptances. Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, commercial paper and bank money market funds that are acquired to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements, as well as equity securities.
The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading at the time of purchase and such designation is evaluated as of each balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities, such as bank time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are classified as such. The Companys other readily marketable investments are classified as either available-for-sale or trading. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, if any, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses, as well as interest, dividends and capital gains distributions on all securities, are included in earnings.
Cash equivalents and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale were $2,624million and $2,167million at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, respectively and those classified as held-to-maturity were $108million and $7million at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, respectively. All of 26 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) these securities have contractual maturities of twelve months or less at time of acquisition. Because of the short term to maturity, and hence relative price insensitivity to changes in market interest rates, amortized cost approximates fair value for all of these securities. As such, no realized or unrealized gains or losses were recorded during each of these years. There were no cash equivalents or short-term investments classified as trading at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000.
Long-term investments classified as trading were $243million and $182million at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, respectively, and were based on published market quotes on November2, 2001 and October27, 2000. Gross realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities were not material in fiscal 2001, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999. There were approximately $1.7million and $0 at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, respectively, of long-term investments classified as available-for-sale. Gross realized gains on available-for-sale investments were $0 in fiscal 2001 and $44million in fiscal 2000. Gross unrealized gains and losses were not material in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. There were no long-term investments classified as held-to-maturity at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000.

Supplemental Cash Flow Statement 	Information 2001 2000 1999 Cash paid during the fiscal year for: Income taxes $ 52,353 $ 208,441 $ 19,582 Interest, net of capitalized interest $ 51,720 $ 4,039 $ 10,808 The Companys primary non-cash financing activities in fiscal 2001 resulted from its current year acquisitions for which 1,462,066shares of common stock were issued (valued at approximately $81.8million) and the assumption of stock options with a fair value of approximately $4.9million. As a result, the Company recognized approximately $8.8million of stock-based compensation expense. The Companys non-cash financing activities in fiscal 1999 consisted solely of the conversion of its 3.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes into common stock.
d.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventories at November3, 2001 and October28, 2000 were as follows: 2001 2000 Raw materials $ 18,221 $ 17,505 Work in process 159,463 179,918 Finished goods 69,168 134,671 Total inventories $ 246,852 $ 332,094 e.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less allowances for depreciation and amortization. The straight-line method of depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial statement purposes; both straight-line and accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes. Capitalized leases and leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Depreciation and amortization are based on the following useful lives: Buildings & Building Equipment Up to 25 years Machinery & Equipment 3-10 years Office Equipment 3-8 years 27 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) Total depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment was $158million, $143million and $139million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Property, plant and equipment included $77million and $82million of capitalized leases in fiscal 2001 and 2000, net of $56million and $49million, respectively, of accumulated depreciation.
Property, plant and equipment includes capitalized interest of $6.5million and $0 as of November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Acquisition-related 	Intangibles 2001 2000 Goodwill $ 219,674 $ 181,219 Other intangibles 9,656 11,479 Total $ 229,330 $ 192,698 Other intangibles include items such as acquired trained workforce and customer base. Goodwill and intangibles are evaluated for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on the related undiscounted cash flows. Amortization lives are principally five years.
The balances shown are net of total accumulated amortization of $88million and $35million as of November3, 2001 and October28, 2000, respectively. Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles was $53million, $13million and $4million for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
g.
Grant Accounting The Companys manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland has received various grants from the Industrial Development Authority of the Republic of Ireland. These grants include capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital grants for the acquisition of property and equipment are netted against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a credit to depreciation expense over the useful life of the related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee hiring and training, and research and development grants are recognized in earnings in the period in which the related expenditures are incurred by the Company.
h.Translation of Foreign Currencies The functional currency for the Companys foreign sales operations is the applicable local currency. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are accumulated in other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are included in income currently, including those at the Companys principal foreign manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses included in other expenses, net, were not material in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999.
i.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Agreements The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency option contracts and currency swap agreements to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the Companys operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the Euro. These foreign exchange contracts are entered into to support product sales, purchases and financing transactions made in the normal course of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) Effective October29, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133, (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.138, (FAS 138), Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. As a result of the adoption of FAS 133, the Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in earnings or in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI)depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. Changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings. While the adoption of FAS 133 on October29, 2000 did not have a material impact on operations, it resulted in a $5million loss recognized in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001.
Foreign Exchange Exposure Management The Company has significant international sales and purchase transactions in foreign currencies and has a policy of hedging forecasted and actual foreign currency risk with forward foreign exchange contracts. The Companys forward foreign exchange contracts are denominated in Japanese yen and the Euro and are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. In accordance with FAS 133, hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedge as cash flow hedges and evaluated for effectiveness monthly. As the terms of the forward contract and the underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the anticipated transaction, with the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument reported as a component of OCI in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any residual change in fair value of the instruments, or ineffectiveness, is recognized immediately in other expense. No ineffectiveness was recognized in fiscal 2001.
Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments involve, to a varying degree, elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Companys foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company continually monitors the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limits the financial exposure with any one financial institution. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

Fair Values of Financial 	Instruments The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.
November 3, 2001 October 28, 2000 Carrying Carrying Amount Fair Value Amount Fair Value Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,364,949 $ 1,364,949 $ 1,736,421 $ 1,736,421 Short-term investments 1,428,278 1,428,278 498,844 498,844 Long-term investments 242,502 242,502 181,751 181,751 Liabilities: Short-term borrowings (434 ) (434 ) (5,752 ) (5,752 ) Long-term debt, including current portion (1,200,000 ) (1,145,400 ) (1,200,261 ) (1,101,261 ) Foreign Currency Instruments and Interest Rate 	Agreements: Interest rate swap and cap agreements (62 ) (62 ) (33 ) (62 ) Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 928 928 (3,555 ) (3,817 ) Foreign currency option contracts   75 22 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments The carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short term to maturity and readily available market for these types of investments.
Long-term investments The fair value of long-term investments is based on quoted market values.
Short-term borrowings The carrying amounts of these variable-rate borrowings approximate fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.
Long-term debt The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market values.
30 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) Interest rate swap and cap agreements The fair value of interest rate swap and cap agreements is obtained from dealer quotes. These values represent the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration current interest rates.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts The estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is based on the estimated amount at which they could be settled based on forward market exchange rates.
Foreign currency option contracts The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is obtained from dealer quotes. This value represents the estimated net amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement.
k.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful lives of fixed assets, allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, inventory reserves, potential reserves relating to litigation matters, accrued liabilities and other reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
l.Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments and trade accounts receivable.
The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with high credit quality financial institutions and monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
The Company sells its products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers involved in a variety of industries including industrial automation, instrumentation, military/aerospace and, to an increasing degree, communications, computers and peripherals, and high-performance consumer electronics. The Company has adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in these markets. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and although the Company generally does not require collateral, letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain circumstances. Reserves are provided for estimated amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.
m.Concentration of Other Risks The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns. The Companys financial results are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory depending on the mix of future business. As a result, the Company may experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the factors mentioned above or other factors.
31 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) n.Revenue Recognition Prior to fiscal 2001, the Company recognized revenue from product sales to end users upon shipment. In fiscal 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101. Accordingly revenue from product sales to end-users is now recognized when title passes, which for shipments to certain foreign countries is subsequent to product shipment. Title for these shipments ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. This accounting change did not materially impact the Companys results of operations for fiscal 2001. For all periods presented, revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell the products to the end users.
o.Comprehensive Income Components of comprehensive income include net income and certain transactions that have generally been reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity. Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income, currency translation adjustments, available-for-sale securities valuation adjustments, and net gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
p.Advertising Expense Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $10.4 million in fiscal 2001, $16.1million in fiscal 2000 and $13.0million in fiscal 1999.
q.Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Additionally, deferred tax assets and liabilities are separated into current and noncurrent amounts based on the classification of the related assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.
r.Earnings Per Share of Common Stock Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of future issues of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities. In calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the average market price for the period. In fiscal 2001, a total of 9,246,720 shares related to convertible debt financing and 7,533,121 shares related to outstanding stock options are excluded from the earnings per share calculation because the effect would be anti-dilutive, but these shares could be dilutive in the future. In fiscal 2000, a total of 2,311,680 shares related 32 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) to convertible debt financing are excluded from the earnings per share calculation because the effect would be anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 2001 2000 1999 Basic: Net income $ 356,377 $ 607,132 $ 196,819 Weighted shares outstanding 359,113 353,363 336,482 Earnings per share $ 1.00 $ 1.71 $ 0.58 Diluted: Net income $ 356,377 $ 607,132 $ 196,819 Interest related to convertible subordinated 	notes, net of tax   1,906 Net income $ 356,377 $ 607,132 $ 198,725 Weighted shares outstanding 359,113 353,363 336,482 Assumed exercise of common stock equivalents 22,849 27,794 18,822 Assumed conversion of subordinated notes   7,600 Weighted average common and common equivalent 	shares 381,962 381,157 362,904 Earnings per share $ 0.93 $ 1.59 $ 0.55 s.Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants. The Company has granted restricted stock for a fixed number of shares to employees for nominal consideration. Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is recorded ratably over the restriction period.
t.New Accounting Standards Effective October29, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.133, (FAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.138, Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. FAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure such instruments at fair market value. Under certain circumstances, a portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI)until the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income immediately. While the adoption of FAS 133 on October29, 2000 did not have a material impact on operations, it resulted in a $5million loss recognized in OCI, which was reclassified into earnings during fiscal 2001.
In August 2001 the Company adopted Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 101 summarizes the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No.141, (FAS 141), Business Combinations and No.142, (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other 33 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) Intangible Assets. FAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under FAS 142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the Statement. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. We must adopt these new pronouncements no later than November 2002 with earlier adoption permitted. Application of the non-amortization provisions of FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $54 million, beginning in fiscal 2003. We will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 141 and 142 will have on our financial position or results of operations.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.143, (FAS 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It also applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and (or)the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. We are required to adopt FAS 143 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we do not believe that the adoption of FAS 143 will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.144, (FAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business of APB Opinion No.30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. We are required to adopt FAS 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and we have not yet determined what effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 144 will have on our financial position or results of operations.
u.Stock Split On February15, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 split of the Companys common stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend on March15, 2000 by the distribution of one share of common stock for every share held on the record date of February28, 2000. In connection with the stock split the number of common stock purchase rights that are associated with each share of common stock was reduced from one to one-half. All historical per share amounts in this report have been restated to reflect the split.

This gain is included in other nonoperating income.
Other investments consist primarily of long-term investments in mutual funds and bank money market funds, which are related to the Companys deferred compensation plan and are offset by a corresponding noncurrent liability to the plan participants. These investments are classified as trading.
Investments are stated at fair value, which is based on market quotes, interest rates or management estimates, as appropriate. Adjustments to fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as an increase or decrease in stockholders equity. Adjustments to fair value of, and income pertaining to, other investments are recorded in operating expense.

On October2, 2000, Philips filed suit against the Company, Cirrus Logic, Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation and Standard Microsystems Corporation alleging patent infringement and seeking injunctive relief, treble damages for alleged willful infringement and unspecified damages. Subsequent to fiscal 2001, the Company entered into a settlement with Philips that was not material.
The Company is a defendant in a federal lawsuit brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by Linear Technology Corporation (LTC). On June26, 1997, LTC filed suit against the Company, Impala Linear Corporation, Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd., Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. and Unitrode Corporation alleging patent infringement and seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The case was originally scheduled for trial on liability issues beginning on September7, 1999. The original district judge recused himself and the case was reassigned three times before the Court granted several motions for summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of the defendants in September 2001. The Court also denied LTCs motion for summary judgment of infringement and willful infringement against the Company. On October4, 2001, the Court indicated that it would stay the matter and certify similar issues as to the Company to allow all parties to take appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). LTC, Maxim and Unitrode have filed cross appeals with the Federal Circuit and have begun the briefing process. On November1, 2001, LTC and the Company jointly petitioned the Federal Circuit to permit them to address the issues certified for appeal. The joint petition is still pending. While the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail in this litigation, it believes that resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, although an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flow in the quarter, or annual period in which this matter is resolved.
Patent infringement suits were pending against the Companys wholly owned French subsidiary by Sextant Avionique, S.A. (Sextant) in France claiming that the Companys accelerometer infringes certain Sextant patents. Sextant has obtained a court ruling that the Company infringed Sextants French patents, and therefore, unless the decision is reversed, the Company will be unable to manufacture or sell any infringing accelerometers in France. The Company is currently appealing the French courts decision and expects a decision to be rendered by the French court in fiscal 2002. The Company does not believe that the French 39 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) courts decision will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.
From time to time as a normal incidence of the nature of the Companys business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. As to such claims and litigation, the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail. However, the Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, although an adverse outcome of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or cash flow in the quarter, or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved.
11.Stockholders Equity Stock Plans In fiscal 1998, the stockholders approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan (1998 Plan), which provides for the issuance of nonstatutory and incentive stock options to purchase up to 30million shares of common stock. In March 2000, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1998 Plan to increase the shares reserved for issuance by an additional 34million shares. Officers, employees, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted options under this plan at a price not less than 100% (110% in the case of incentive stock options granted to 10% or greater stockholders) of the fair market value of the common stock at the time the option is granted. The Companys 1988 Stock Option Plan was terminated upon adoption of the 1998 Stock Option Plan; however, options to purchase common stock remain outstanding under the plan.
While the Company may grant options to employees, which become exercisable at different times or within different periods, the Company has generally granted options to employees that are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of 331/3% each on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Under the 1994 Director Option Plan, which was amended in 1998, each non-employee director was granted annually a non-statutory option to purchase 21,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. Up to 1999, each newly elected non-employee director received a grant of an option to purchase 21,000 shares of Common Stock upon his or her election to the Board (the Initial Grant). The 1994 Director Option Plan was amended in 1999 whereby the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Initial Grant was increased from 21,000 to 60,000. On December8, 1999, the 1994 Director Option Plan was terminated (effective March14, 2000), and the Board of Directors authorized that from and after March14, 2000, all options granted to non-employee directors will be granted under the Companys 1998 Plan, under which each non-employee director is granted annually a non-statutory stock option to purchase 20,000 shares (formerly 25,000 shares) of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The options granted to directors under the 1998 Plan, as well as the options previously granted under the 1994 Director Option Plan, are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of 331/3% each on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company also has options outstanding under the 1992 Director Option Plan that are exercisable on a cumulative basis in annual installments of 331/3% each on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.

Employees purchased 390,719 shares in fiscal 2001 (1,011,624 and 1,312,800 in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively) for $15.2million ($16.5million and $12.9million in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively). At November3, 2001, approximately 2,991,000 common shares, net of retirements, remained available for issuance under the ESPP.
Under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan, which expired in December 2000, a maximum of 5,400,000 shares of common stock were authorized for awards by the Company to key employees for nominal consideration. Shares awarded from the plan were restricted as to transfer, usually for a period of five years and, under certain conditions, were subject to repurchase by the Company at the original purchase price per share. There were no additional shares awarded under the restricted stock plans in either fiscal 2001 or fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, $2.1million, $2.2million, and $2.8million, respectively, of compensation was charged to 41 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) expense. At November3, 2001, there were 1,221,982 shares of common stock, net of forfeitures, reserved for issuance under the 1991 Restricted Stock Plan.
As of November3, 2001, a total of 90,134,362 common shares were reserved for issuance under the Companys stock plans.
Common Stock Repurchase In November 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 15million shares of its common stock. As of November3, 2001, the Company had purchased 417,400 shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $52.30 per share. The repurchased shares are held as treasury shares and are being used for the employee stock purchase plan and other benefit plans.
Stock-Based Compensation As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123 (FAS123), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, in accounting for stock-based awards to employees. Under APB25, the Company generally recognizes no compensation expense with respect to such awards.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by FAS123 for awards granted after October28, 1995 as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair value method of FAS123. The fair value of the Companys stock-based awards to employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys stock-based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards to employees. The fair value of the Companys stock-based awards to employees was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted average assumptions: Options ESPP 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 Expected life (years) 5.3 4.9 6.1 1.0 1.0 1.0 Expected stock price volatility 65.4 % 56.6 % 52.9 % 89.9 % 72.5 % 64.1 % Risk-free interest rate 5.7 % 6.0 % 5.3 % 3.9 % 6.3 % 5.1 % The following is a summary of weighted average grant date values generated by application of the Black-Scholes model: Weighted Average Grant Date Value 2001 2000 1999 Stock option plans $ 26.95 $ 16.90 $ 9.77 ESPP $ 37.82 $ 7.88 $ 4.40 As required under FAS123, the reported net income and diluted earnings per share have been presented to reflect the impact had the Company been required to include the amortization of the Black-Scholes option 42 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) value as expense. For purposes of this disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting periods. The Companys pro forma information follows: 2001 2000 1999 Pro forma net income $ 191,598 $ 526,615 $ 162,872 Pro forma diluted earnings per share $ 0.50 $ 1.38 $ 0.45 The effects of applying FAS123 on pro forma disclosures are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of future years. Because FAS123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to October28, 1995, the pro forma effect is not fully reflected for fiscal year 1999.
Preferred Stock The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par value Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred stock at the time of issuance. An aggregate of 300,000 shares of preferred stock have been designated as SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock for issuance in connection with the Companys Stockholder Rights Plan.
Common Stock Purchase Rights In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the Stockholder Rights Plan) that replaced a plan adopted by the Board in 1988. Pursuant to the Stockholder Rights Plan, after giving effect to the Companys two-for-one stock split effected on March15, 2000, each share of the Companys Common Stock (Common Stock) currently has an associated one-half of a right. Under certain circumstances, each whole right would entitle the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $180 in cash, subject to adjustment.
The rights are not exercisable and cannot be transferred separately from the Common Stock until ten business days (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors) after (i)the public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired (or obtained rights to acquire) beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Common Stock or (ii)the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock. If and when the rights become exercisable, each holder of a right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of Common Stock (or in certain circumstances, cash property or other securities of the Company) that equals the exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current market price (as defined in the Stockholder Rights Plan) per share of Common Stock at the date of the occurrence of such event. In the event at any time after any person becomes an acquiring person, (i)the Company is consolidated with, or merged with and into, another entity and the Company is not the surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or if the Company is the surviving entity, but shares of its outstanding common stock are changed or exchanged for stock or securities or cash or any other property, or (ii)50% or more of the Companys assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right shall thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by 50% of the current market price of such common stock at the date of the occurrence of the event.
The rights have certain anti-takeover effects, in that they would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in the Company on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. The rights expire on March17, 2008 but may be redeemed by the Company for $.001 per right at any time prior to the tenth day following a persons acquisition of 15% or more of the Companys Common Stock. So long as the rights are not separately transferable, each new share of Common Stock issued will have one-half of a right associated with it.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS(Continued) 12.Retirement Plans The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of its eligible United States employees. This plan provides for Company contributions of up to 5% of each participants total eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes an amount equal to each participants contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 2% of each participants total eligible compensation, plus 50% of the contributions between 2% and 4%. The Company also has various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain non U.S. employees that are consistent with local statutes and practices. The total expense related to all of the Companys retirement plans was approximately $28million in fiscal 2001, $26million in fiscal 2000 and $21million in fiscal year 1999, which primarily consisted of costs related to the U.S. defined contribution plan. Also included in total expense is pension expense related to non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $3million for each of the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999.
Non-U.S. Plan Disclosures The Companys funding policy for its foreign defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The plans assets consist primarily of U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, bonds, property and cash.

Accrued benefit cost at October28, 2000 includes projected benefit obligations of $13.2million and accumulated benefit obligations of $9.7million, versus plan assets of $4.8million for three plans whose obligations exceeded their assets.
The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within the various countries. The projected benefit obligation was determined using the following assumptions: 2001 2000 Discount rate 2.5%-12% 3%-12% Rate of increase in compensation levels 2.5%-12% 3%-10% Expected long-term returns on assets 5%-12% 5%-12% 45 Table of Contents ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
