Business General Amphenol Corporation (Amphenol or the Company) is one of the worlds largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems and coaxial and flat-ribbon cable. The Company was incorporated in 1987. Certain predecessor businesses, which now constitute part of the Company, have been in business since 1932. The primary end markets for the Companys products are:  communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;  a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration and traditional and hybrid- electrical automotive applications; and  commercial aerospace and military applications.
The Companys strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. For 2008, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $3,236.5 million, $632.2 million and $419.2 million, respectively. The table below summarizes information regarding the Companys primary markets and end applications for the Companys products: Information Technology& Communications Industrial/Automotive Commercial Aerospace & Military Percentage of Sales 62% 19% 19% Primary End Applications Wireless Communication Systems  wireless   handsets and personal communication devices  wireless   infrastructure equipment  base   stations  cell   sites Broadband   Networks  cable television   networks  set top converters  high-speed data kits  cable modems  network   switching equipment Factory automation Instrumentation Automobile safety systems and on-board electronics Hybrid-electrical vehicles Mass transportation Oil exploration Off-road construction Medical equipment Satellite radio systems Geophysical Alternative energy Military and Commercial Aircraft  avionics  engine   controls  flight controls  passenger   related systems Missile systems Military communications systems Satellite and space programs Radar systems Military vehicles Ordnance Telecommunications and Data Communications  servers and storage   systems  computers,   personal computers and related peripherals  data networking   equipment  routers, and switches 3 Table of Contents The Company designs and manufactures connectors and interconnect systems, which are used primarily to conduct electrical and optical signals for a wide range of sophisticated electronic applications. The Company believes, based primarily on published market research, that it is the second largest connector and interconnect product manufacturer in the world. The Company has developed a broad range of connector and interconnect products for the information technology and communications equipment applications including the converging voice, video and data communications markets. The Company offers a broad range of interconnect products for factory automation and motion control systems, machine tools, instrumentation and medical systems, mass transportation applications and automotive applications, including airbags, pretensioner seatbelts and other on-board automotive electronics. In addition, the Company is the leading supplier of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors that require superior reliability and performance under conditions of stress and in hostile environments. These conditions are frequently encountered in commercial and military aerospace applications and other demanding industrial applications such as solar and wind power generation, oil exploration, medical equipment, hybrid-electrical vehicles and off-road construction.
The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes. The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia. The Company sells its products through its own global sales force, independent manufacturers representatives and a global network of electronics distributors to thousands of OEMsin approximately 60 countries throughout the world. The Company also sells certain products to electronic manufacturing services (EMS), to original design manufacturing (ODM) companies and to communication network operators. For 2008, approximately 40% of the Companys net sales were in North America, 21% were in Europe and 39% were in Asia and other countries.
The Company generally implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers which result in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers new products and programs. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. By developing application specific products, the Company has decreased its exposure to standard products which generally experience greater pricing pressure. In addition to product design teams and customer collaboration arrangements, the Company uses key account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.
The Company and industry analysts estimate that the worldwide sales of interconnect products were approximately $45 billion in 2008. The Company believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is highly fragmented with over 2,000 producers of connectors and interconnect systems worldwide, of which the 10 largest, including Amphenol, accounted for a combined market share of approximately 44% in 2008.
The Companys acquisition strategy is focused on the consolidation of this highly fragmented industry. The Company targets acquisitions on a global basis in high growth segments that have complementary capabilities to the Company from a product, customer or geographic standpoint. The Company looks to add value to smaller companies through its global capabilities and generally expects acquisitions to be accretive to performance in the first year. In 2008, the Company spent approximately $136 million on acquisitions, including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration. A significant portion of this spending was made on three acquisitions in target markets, including the wireless infrastructure, military/aerospace and internet markets, which broadened and enhanced its product offering in these areas.
4 Table of Contents Business Segments The following table sets forth the dollar amounts of the Companys net trade sales for its business segments. For a discussion of factors affecting changes in sales by business segment and additional segment financial data, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Interconnect Products and Assemblies.
The Company produces a broad range of interconnect products and assemblies primarily for voice, video and data communication systems, commercial aerospace and military systems, automotive and mass transportation applications, and industrial and factory automation equipment. Interconnect products include connectors, which when attached to an electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device, facilitate electronic or fiber optic transmission. Interconnect assemblies generally consist of a system of cable and connectors for linking electronic and fiber optic equipment. The Company designs and produces a broad range of connector and cable assembly products used in communication applications, such as: engineered cable assemblies used in base stations for wireless communication systems and internet networking equipment; smart card acceptor and other interconnect devices used in mobile telephones; set top boxes and other applications to facilitate reading data from smart cards; fiber optic connectors used in fiber optic signal transmission; backplane and input/output connectors and assemblies used for servers and data storage devices and linking personal computers and peripheral equipment; sculptured flexible circuits used for integrating printed circuit boards in communication applications and hinge products used in mobile phone and other mobile communication devices. The Company also designs and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector products and antennas used in telecommunications, computer and office equipment, instrumentation equipment, local area networks and automotive electronics. The Companys radio frequency interconnect products and assemblies are also used in base stations, mobile communication devices and other components of cellular and personal communications networks.
The Company believes that it is the largest supplier of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors. Such connectors require superior performance and reliability under conditions of stress and in hostile environments. High performance environmental connectors and interconnect systems are generally used to interconnect electronic and fiber optic systems in sophisticated aerospace, military, commercial and industrial equipment. These applications present demanding technological requirements in that the connectors are subject to rapid and severe temperature changes, vibration, humidity and nuclear radiation. Frequent applications of these connectors and interconnect systems include aircraft, guided missiles, radar, military vehicles, equipment for spacecraft, energy, medical instrumentation, geophysical applications and off-road construction equipment. The Company also designs and produces industrial interconnect products used in a variety of applications such as factory automation equipment, mass transportation applications including railroads and marine transportation; and automotive safety products including interconnect devices and systems used in automotive airbags, pretensioner seatbelts, antilock braking systems and other on-board automotive electronic systems. The Company also designs and produces highly-engineered cable and backplane assemblies. Such assemblies are specially designed by the Company in conjunction with OEM customers for specific applications, primarily for computer, wired and wireless communication systems, office equipment, industrial and aerospace applications. The cable assemblies utilize the Companys connector and cable products as well as components purchased from others.
5 Table of Contents Cable Products.
The Company designs, manufactures and markets coaxial cable primarily for use in the cable television industry. The Companys Times Fiber Communications subsidiary is the worlds second largest producer of coaxial cable for the cable television market. The Company believes that its Times Fiber Communications unit is one of the lowest cost producers of coaxial cable for cable television. The Companys coaxial cable and connector products are used in cable television systems including full service cable television/telecommunication systems being installed by cable operators and telecommunication companies offering video, voice and data services. The Company is also a major supplier of coaxial cable to the international cable television market. The Company manufactures two primary types of coaxial cable: semi-flexible, which has an aluminum tubular shield, and flexible, which has one or more braided metallic shields. Semi-flexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution portion of cable television systems, and flexible cable (also known as drop cable) is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television subscribers residence. Flexible cable is also used in other communication applications. The Company has also developed a broad line of radio frequency and fiber optic interconnect components for full service cable television/ telecommunication networks.
The Company is also a leading producer of high speed data cables and specialty cables, which are used to connect internal components in systems with space and component configuration limitations. Such products are used in computer and office equipment applications as well as in a variety of telecommunication applications.
International Operations The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Approximately 64% of the Companys sales for the year ended December31, 2008 were outside the United States. Approximately 17% of the Companys sales were sold to customers in China, and the Company has international manufacturing and assembly facilities in China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Japan, Malaysia, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Africa and Australia. European operations include manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Estonia and sales offices in most European markets. The Companys international manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the respective local markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Companys other operations around the world. The Company has low cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in China, Mexico, India, Eastern Europe and Africa to serve regional and world markets.
Customers The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales for the year ended December31, 2008. The Company sells its products to over 10,000 customer locations worldwide. The Companys products are sold directly to OEMs, contract manufacturers, cable system operators, telecommunication companies and through manufacturers representatives and distributors. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices.
The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company has concentrated its efforts on service and productivity improvements including advanced computer aided design and manufacturing systems, statistical process controls and just-in-time inventory programs to increase product quality and shorten product delivery schedules. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company has achieved a preferred supplier designation from many of its customers.
The Companys sales to distributors represented approximately 15% of the Companys 2008 sales. The Companys recognized brand names, including Amphenol, Times Fiber, Tuchel, Socapex, Sine, Spectra-Strip, Pyle-National, Matrix, Kai Jack and others, together with the Companys strong connector design-in position (products that are specified in customer drawings), enhance its ability to reach the secondary market through its network of distributors.
Manufacturing The Company employs advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations as well as proprietary process technology for specialty and coaxial cable production. The Companys manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. Outsourcing of certain fabrication processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards, and many of the Companys manufacturing facilities are certified 6 Table of Contents to other quality standards, including QS9000, ISO14000 and TS16469.
The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to lower its production costs and to improve service to customers. The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis with manufacturing and assembly operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. To better serve certain high volume customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near these major customers.
The Companys policy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and maximize the return on capital investments.
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, brass, steel, copper and bimetallic products used for cable, contacts and connector shells, and plastic materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials, or if one source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements.
Research and Development The Companys research and development expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes was $68.1 million, $62.4million and $53.7 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys research and development activities focus on selected product areas and are performed by individual operating divisions. Generally, the operating divisions work closely with OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products and systems that meet specific customer needs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period.
Trademarks and Patents The Company owns a number of active patents worldwide. The Company also regards its trademarks Amphenol, Times Fiber, Tuchel, Socapex and Spectra-Strip to be of material value in its businesses. The Company has exclusive rights in all its major markets to use these registered trademarks. The Company has rights to other registered and unregistered trademarks which it believes to be of value to its businesses. While the Company considers its patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, the Company does not believe that its competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that its operations are dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
Competition The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. In the area of coaxial cable for cable television, the Company believes that it and CommScope are the primary world providers of such cable; however, CommScope is larger than the Company in this market. In addition, the Company faces competition from other companies that have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the coaxial cable market.
Backlog The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled orders was $505million and $523million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12months. Significant elements of the Companys business, such as sales to the communications related markets (including wireless communications, telecom& data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.
Employees As of December31, 2008, the Company had approximately 30,000 full-time employees worldwide of which approximately 21,100 were located in low cost regions. Of these employees, approximately 24,200 were hourly employees and the remainder were 7 Table of Contents salaried. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.
Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell InternationalInc. in December1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.
Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. The Company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three off-site disposal sites previously utilized by the Companys Sidney facility and others, to wit the Richardson Hill Road landfill, the Route 8 landfill and the Sidney landfill. Actions at the Richardson Hill Road and Sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as Superfund sites on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The Route 8 landfill was designated as a New York State Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site, with remedial actions taken pursuant to Chapter 6, Section375-1 of the New York Code of Rulesand Regulations. In addition, the Company is currently performing monitoring activities at, and in proximity to, its manufacturing site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other off-site disposal sites. All such environmental matters referred to in this paragraph are covered by the Honeywell Agreement.
Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon information currently known by management about the Companys manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters, that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations.
Other The Companys annual report on Form10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form8-K, and amendments to those reports are available, without charge, on its web site, www.amphenol.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC. Copies are also available without charge, from Amphenol Corporation, Investor Relations, 358 Hall Avenue, Wallingford, CT 06492.
Cautionary Information for Purposes of Forward Looking Statements Statements made by the Company in written or oral form to various persons, including statements made in this annual report on Form10-K and other filings with the SEC, that are not strictly historical facts are forward looking statements. Such statements 8 Table of Contents should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment. Certain of the risk factors, assumptions or uncertainties that could cause the Company to fail to conform with expectations and predictions are described below under the caption Risk Factors in PartI, Item IA and elsewhere in this Form10-K. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this Form10-K as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We do not intend to update these forward looking statements.
Item 1A. Risk Factors Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Form10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the Companys business and operations.
If any of the following risks actually occur, the Companys business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Companys common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including telecommunication and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications.
Approximately 62% of the Companys revenues for the year ended December31, 2008 came from sales to the communications industry, including telecommunication and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change (see belowThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth). These markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. The loss of one or more of the large communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry, and the Companys failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.
Approximately 10% of the Companys 2008 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications industry. Demand for the Companys broadband communications products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending, and, therefore, the Companys sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, acquisitions of cable television operators by non-cable television operators, cable system consolidation within the industry, the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing, competition from satellite, telephone and television providers and telephone companies, technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease.
Changes in defense expenditures may reduce the Companys sales.
Approximately 15% of the Companys 2008 revenues came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1% of its 2008 revenues. The substantial majority of these sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. However, the Companys sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Nevertheless, the Companys sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A decline in U.S. defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the Companys business.
The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.
The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the Companys existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the Companys business and operations.
9 Table of Contents The Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth.
The Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 29% of 2008 net sales. The Companys long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line concepts. If the Company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the Companys new products do not meet with market acceptance, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
Covenants in the Companys credit agreements may adversely affect the Company.
The Companys bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants are presently restrictive to the Companys operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Companys control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that the Company will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Companys credit agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Companys credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, the Company may not have sufficient assets to repay the Companys credit facilities and other indebtedness. See Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Downgrades of the Companys debt rating could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial position.
If the credit rating agencies that rate the Companys debt were to downgrade the Companys credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the Companys performance, it may increase the Companys cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing, which could adversely affect the Companys business.
The Companys results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates .
The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Companys financing activities. The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates. As of December31, 2008, the Company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December2009, December2009 and July2010, respectively.
A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December31, 2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.2 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.
The Companys results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital. There can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the results of the Companys operations.
The Company is subject to the risks of political, economic and military instability in countries outside the United States.
Non-U.S. markets account for a substantial portion of the Companys business. During 2008, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 64% of the Companys net sales. The Company employs more than 85% of its workforce outside the United States. The Companys customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. Because of the Companys extensive non-U.S. operations, it is exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:  tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes;  regulations related to customs and import/export matters; 10 Table of Contents  longer payment cycles;  tax issues, such as tax law changes, examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country as compared to the United States, and difficulties in repatriating in a tax-efficient manner cash generated or held abroad;  challenges in collecting accounts receivable;  employment regulations and local labor conditions;  difficulties protecting intellectual property;  instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; and  the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.
The Company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill.
The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few years. It is possible the Company may experience difficulty integrating such acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may not perform as expected. At December31, 2008, the total assets of the Company were $2,994.2million, which included $1,232.3million of goodwill. The goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price, inclusive of performance-based cash consideration, over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The Company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142. Such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Companys businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill.
The Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels, which could adversely affect its results of operations.
The Company uses basic materials like steel, aluminum, copper, bi-metallic products, gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing process. Volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such products. In addition, to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements, the Companys margin may decline.
The Company may not be able to attract and retain key employees.
The Companys continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the Company needs to achieve its business objectives may have adverse effects on the Companys performance.
Changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond the Companys control may adversely impact its business.
The following factors could adversely impact the Companys business:  A global economic slowdown in any one, or all, of the Companys market segments.
The effects of significant changes in monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures.
Rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation.
Unexpected government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers.
Unforeseen intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict and trade wars.
Unforeseen interruptions to the Companys business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions, inventory excesses or natural disasters.

Item 2. Properties The Companys fixed assets include certain plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Companys plants, warehouses, machinery and equipment are in good operating condition, are well maintained, and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December31, 2008, the Company operated a total of 208 plants and warehouses of which (a)the locations in the U.S. had approximately 2.6 million square feet, of which 1.2 million square feet were leased; (b)the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 5.2million square feet, of which 3.9 million square feet were leased; and (c)the square footage by segment was approximately 6.8 million square feet and 1.0 million square feet for the interconnect products segment and the cable products segment, respectively.
The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in several legal actions in which various amounts are claimed arising from normal business activities. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be precisely determined, in the opinion of management, such matters are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders No matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during the last quarter of the year ended December31, 2008.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document.
Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2008, approximately 64% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are:  communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;  a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid-electrical automotive applications; and  commercial aerospace and military applications.
The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 7% of net sales in 2008. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.
The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas.
The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:  Focus on customer needs  Design and develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions  Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities  Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure  Maintain a culture of controlling costs  Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December31, 2008, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $3,236.5 million, $632.2 million and $419.2 million, respectively; up 14%, 14% and 19%, respectively, from 2007. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in predominantly all of the Companys related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in Results of Operations below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2008, the Company generated operating cash flow of $481.5 million.
16 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.
YearEndedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 67.6 67.4 68.1 Selling, general and   administrative expense 12.9 13.2 13.9 Casualty loss related to   flood   .8 Operating income 19.5 19.4 17.2 Interest expense (1.2 ) (1.3 ) (1.6 ) Other expenses, net (.3 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Income before income taxes 18.0 17.6 15.1 Provision for income taxes (5.0 ) (5.2 ) (4.8 ) Net income 13.0 % 12.4 % 10.3 % 17 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Net sales were $3,236.5 million for the year ended December31, 2008 compared to $2,851.0million for 2007, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 (approximately 91% of net sales) increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($2,950.6million in 2008 versus $2,569.3 million in 2007). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets, except automotive, including the wireless communications, military/aerospace, telecommunications and data communications and industrial markets. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $205.2 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating to new products for mobile phones, increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent increased sales to cell site installation customers. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $90.8 million, primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs, including war related spending, an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $53.9 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $20.1 million) primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and railway/mass transit markets. The automotive market was slightly down in 2008 (approximately $3.0 million) versus 2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and European automotive markets. Sales of cable products in 2008 (approximately 9% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2007 ($285.9 million in 2008 versus $281.8 million in 2007). Such increase is primarily due to the impact of price increases.
Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2008 and 2007 were relatively flat ($1,159.3 million in 2008 versus $1,155.8 million in 2007); international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23% in U.S. dollars ($2,077.2 million in 2008 versus $1,695.2million in 2007) and increased approximately 21% in local currency compared to 2007. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2008 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $34.3million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007.
The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat at 32.4% in 2008 compared to 32.6% in 2007. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 0.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. Cable operating margins decreased 1.0% due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $416.9 million and $377.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or approximately 13% of net sales in both 2008 and 2007. The increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses.
Research and development expenditures increased approximately $5.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Selling and marketing expense remained approximately 6.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% of sales for both 2008 and 2007, increased by approximately $16.1 million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $3.9 million as well as cost increases relating to salaries and employee-related benefits.
Interest expense was $39.6 million for 2008 compared to $36.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to the higher average debt levels in 2008.
Other expenses, net for 2008 and 2007 were $10.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.4 million in 2008 and $10.5 million in 2007), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.1 million in 2008 and $5.2 million in 2007), and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.8 million in both 2008 and 2007) offset by interest income ($4.7 million in 2008 and $2.7 million in 2007).
The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 28.0% in 2008 and 29.5% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately $8.7 million or $.04 per share.
18 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Net sales were $2,851.0 million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to $2,471.4million for 2006, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. The increase in sales in 2007 over 2006 excluding acquisitions was 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2007 (approximately 90% of net sales) increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to 2006 ($2,569.3million in 2007 versus $2,207.5 million in 2006). Sales increased in all of the Companys major end markets including the military/aerospace, wireless communications, industrial/automotive, and telecommunications and data communications markets. Sales to the military/aerospace markets increased approximately $117.5 million primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs including war related spending, as well as an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers. The increase in sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $104.6 million) is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products for both mobile phones and laptop computers, and to a lesser extent, to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and cell site installation customers. The increase in sales in the industrial/automotive market (approximately $77.0 million) primarily reflects increased new product sales to the European automotive market, increased sales to the natural resource exploration and factory automation markets as well as the impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets (approximately $54.1 million) reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and transmission equipment for data centers. Sales of cable products in 2007 (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 7% compared to 2006 ($281.8 million in 2007 versus $263.9million in 2006). Such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases.
Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2007 increased approximately 9% compared to 2006 ($1,155.8 million in 2007 versus $1,060.0 million in 2006); international sales for 2007 increased approximately 20% in U.S. dollars ($1,695.2 million in 2007 versus $1,411.5million in 2006) and increased approximately 16% in local currency compared to 2006. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2007 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $66.3million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2006.
The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33% in 2007 compared to 32% in 2006. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control. In addition, cable operating margins increased 0.7% due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of specialty products, increased production levels in low cost facilities and price increases partially offset by higher material costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $377.3 million and $342.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in expense in 2007 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and administrative expenses as follows.
Research and development expenditures increased approximately $8.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4% and 5% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, increased by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million, and cost increases relating to professional fees as well as salaries and employee-related benefits.
The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of 2006. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June28 to July14, 2006. Production activity was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006. As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0 million.
Interest expense was $36.9 million for 2007 compared to $38.8 million for 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the lower average debt levels in 2007.
Other expenses, net, for 2007 and 2006 were $15.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests ($10.5 million in 2007 and $6.0 million in 2006), program fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($5.2 million in 2007 and $5.0 million in 2006), and agency and commitment fees on the Companys credit facilities ($1.8 million in 2007 and $2.0 million in 2006) offset by interest income ($2.7 million in 2007 and $0.7 million in 2006).
19 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 29.5% in 2007 and 31.5% in 2006. The lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the Companys income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2007 by approximately $10.0 million or $.05 per share.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $481.5 million, $387.9 million and $289.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2006.
The components of working capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of $47.6 million, $21.3 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements and $7.5 million of other current assets partially offset by a $32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable.
The components of working capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 million of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued liabilities.
The components of working capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $10.0 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $9.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1 million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities.
In 2008, accounts receivable increased $5.6 million to $516.0 million, due primarily to acquisitions during the period, partially offset by translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December31, 2008 compared to December31, 2007 (Translation). Days sales outstanding increased to approximately 72 days from 69 days in 2007. Inventory increased $55.6 million to $512.5 million, resulting from higher activity levels in 2008, an increase in inventory days, and inventory from acquired companies of $19.3 million, partially offset by $9.7 million of Translation. Inventory days at December31, 2008 and 2007 were 88 and 80, respectively. The increase in inventory days resulted primarily from a slowdown in sales activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the well publicized global economic slowdown. The Company will continue to focus on inventory reduction as adjustments to production activity continue in response to lower demand levels. Other current assets increased $19.5 million to $92.4 million primarily due to an increase in deferred taxes. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $28.3 million to $344.5 million reflecting capital expenditures of $108.5 million, as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately $9.5 million offset by depreciation of $80.7 million, $7.5 million due to Translation and disposals of $1.5 million. Goodwill increased $140.5 million to $1,232.3 million primarily as a result of three acquisitions completed during the year, the payment of and recording of liabilities for performance-based additional cash consideration of $131.7 million offset by adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions, and by Translation of $25.2 million and $14.1 million in intangible assets reclassified to other long-term assets representing the fair value assigned to identifiable assets associated with the Companys acquisitions in 2007. Other long-term assets increased $37.5 million to $81.4 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2008 acquisitions as well as the reclassification from goodwill discussed above related to 2007 acquisitions and an increase in long-term deferred tax assets primarily associated with the increase in the accrued pension and post-employment obligation, offset by amortization of the intangible asset balances. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $10.6 million and $4.7 million to $306.0 million and $59.6 million, respectively, due primarily to liabilities assumed from acquired companies offset by Translation. The other accrued liabilities including acquisition-related obligations and accrued income taxes increased $99.7 million to $268.8 million relating primarily to an increase of $65.1 million in liabilities associated with performance-based additional cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase in accrued income taxes of $26.2 million due primarily to an increase in liabilities related to foreign income taxes. Accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased $59.9 million to $161.7 million primarily due to a decrease in plan assets during the year resulting from equity market losses in 2008. Other long-term liabilities decreased $4.8 million to $62.2 million due primarily to lower long-term deferred tax liabilities offset by a higher minority interest liability at December31, 2008.
20 Table of Contents In 2008, cash from operating activities of $481.5 million, net borrowings of $61.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $48.4 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $0.9 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of $293.6 million, $135.8 million of acquisitions, including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $108.3 million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, purchases of short-term investments of $2.9 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $31.3 million.
For 2007, cash from operating activities of $387.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $58.2 million, net borrowings of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.3 million were used to fund $179.3 million of acquisitions including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $103.8 million, purchases of treasury stock of $93.6 million, dividend payments of $10.7 million, purchases of short-term investments of $1.4 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $109.5 million.
The Companys senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a five-year $1,000.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in August2011, of which $778.0 million was drawn at December31, 2008. At December31, 2008, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $207.2 million, after a reduction of $14.8 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Companys credit rating from Standard& Poors was BBB- and from Moodys was Baa3.
As of December31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements of $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December2009, December2009 and July2010, respectively.
The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December31, 2008 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $25.0 million; such loss, net of tax of $9.2 million, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement described below. In addition, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $215.0 million and $183.6 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, the majority of which was in non-U.S. accounts as of December31, 2008. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable.
The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2009 will be approximately $85 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. Cumulative dividends declared during 2008 were $10.5 million. Total dividends paid in 2008 were $10.6 million, including those declared in 2007 and paid in 2008. The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings not used for dividend payments to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Companys business, to repurchase shares of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Companys working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the Agreement). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July2009. Upon expiration, the Company intends to replace the Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value. At December31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
21 Table of Contents Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell InternationalInc. in December1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigations, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.
Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs.
Risk Management The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials.
Stock Split On January17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of March16, 2007, and these additional shares were distributed on March30, 2007. The share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split.
Recent Accounting Changes In December2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (1)recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2)recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (3)determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 141R are: (1)that SFAS 141R requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred; (2)that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance-based liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill; and (3)any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. SFAS 141R is effective for the Company for acquisitions completed on or after January1, 2009.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The 22 Table of Contents presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 160 are: (1)SFAS 160 requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests share in income below net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interests share in net income of the Company as is the current practice). During the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests share in income of $10.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2)SFAS 160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders equity. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $19.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities. The Company believes the primary impacts of SFAS 160 will be as described above.
In March2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (1)how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (2)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations; and (3)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet those objectives, SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly impact its disclosure requirements.
Pensions The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan) covering certain of its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $12.0 million, $16.0 million and $17.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical nineteen-year compounded return of 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 9%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.8% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 6%. As of December31, 2008, the asset allocation was 45% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers and 18% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December31, 2008 and 2007 is 8.25% and 9.25%, respectively. This reduction in the long-term rate of return will have the effect of increasing 2009 pension expense by approximately $2.4 million.
The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this basis was 6.25% at both December31, 2008 and 2007. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately $15.5 million.
Effective January1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan, which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1.9 million and $1.7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20 million in both 2008 and 2007. The liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under all the Companys pension and post-retirement benefit plans (the Plans) increased in 2008 to $165.9 million ($4.2 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be 23 Table of Contents made during 2009 for foreign plans) from $101.8 million in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in plan assets in the U.S. Plan offset by the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2008 and by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2009 of approximately $15 million to $20 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August2006. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below.
Revenue Recognition - The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors. The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly.
Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments.
Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units in accordance with SFAS No.142, as of each June30. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had any impairments.
Defined Benefit Plan Obligation  The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors.
The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
24 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December31, 2008, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: ContractualObligations (dollarsinthousands) Total Lessthan 1year 1-3 years 3-5 years Morethan 5years Long-term debt (1) $ 784,601 $ 121 $ 778,951 $ 5,480 $ 49 Capital lease obligations 1,858 318 872 359 309 Operating leases 76,971 20,945 30,395 17,367 8,264 Purchase obligations 139,634 135,823 2,932 879  Accrued acquisition-related obligations (2) 120,357 120,357    Accrued pension and post employment benefit   obligations (3) 37,537 4,220 8,773 9,452 15,092 Total (4) $ 1,160,958 $ 281,784 $ 821,923 $ 33,537 $ 23,714 (1)The Company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps. The actual interest payments made in 2008 were $39,180. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.
(2)Accrued acquisition-related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performance-based cash consideration.
(3)Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans.
The Company also maintains several funded pension and post-retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements, but the Company has made contributions to the U.S. Plan in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2009. As a result, it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected asset returns.
(4)As of December 31, 2008, the Company has FASB Interpretation No. 48 liabilities of $38,058. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the non-current FIN 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these non-current liabilities might be paid.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk As of December31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December2009, December2009 and July2010. At December31, 2008, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 4.09%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December31, 2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.2 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.
25 Table of Contents Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amphenol Corporation Wallingford, Connecticut We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008. We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

30 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Operations Amphenol Corporation (Amphenol or the Company) operates two business segments which consist of manufacturing and selling interconnect products and assemblies, and manufacturing and selling cable products. The Company sells its products to customer locations worldwide.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value of those instruments.
Sale of Receivables A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $100,000 in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable (the Agreement). The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in July2009. Upon expiration, the Company intends to replace the Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value.
Program fees payable to the purchaser under this agreement are equivalent to rates afforded high quality commercial paper issuers plus certain fees and administrative expenses and are included in other expenses, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The aggregate value of receivables transferred to the pool for the year 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $1,068,229, $1,065,892 and $854,372, respectively. At December31, 2008 and 2007, $104,388 and $119,932, respectively, of accounts receivable were transferred to the subsidiary, but not purchased by the financial institution and are therefore included in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $85,000 of receivables were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. The principal components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.
Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite basis by asset group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful lives of such assets which range from 3 to 12years for machinery and equipment and 20 to 40years for buildings. Leasehold building improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life. It is the Companys policy to periodically review fixed asset lives.
31 Table of Contents Goodwill The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys reporting units in accordance with SFAS No.142 (SFAS 142), as of each June30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the operating segments within its two reportable business segments Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products, as the components of these operating segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. As of June30, 2008, and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair market value of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets and consist primarily of proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements and are amortized over the periods of benefit.
Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers.
Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors.
The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers. In the broadband communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and administrative expense.
Retirement Pension Plans Costs for retirement pension plans include current service costs and amortization of prior service costs over periods of up to thirty years. It is the Companys policy to fund current pension costs taking into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized during the employees service with the Company as well as amortization of a transition obligation previously recognized. The recognition of expense for retirement pension plans and medical benefit programs is significantly impacted by estimates made by management such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on assets and future health care costs. The Company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with pension and other post-retirement plan benefits.
Stock Options The Company accounts for its option awards under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.123(R), Share Based Payment, and recognizes compensation expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award. Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, and estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. The Companys income before income taxes was reduced by $16,316, $12,444 and $9,718 for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expense incurred for stock-based compensation plans is classified in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
32 Table of Contents The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2008 2007 2006 Risk free interest rate 3.2 % 4.8 % 4.9 % Expected life 5.5 years 5 years 5 years Expected volatility 28.0 % 26.0 % 30.0 % Expected dividend yield 0.1 % 0.2 % 0.2 % Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
Foreign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of the Companys significant foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been translated at current exchange rates and related revenues and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity. Transaction gains and losses related to operating assets and liabilities are included in selling, general and administrative expense, and those related to non-operating assets and liabilities are included in other expenses, net.
Research and Development Costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and applications are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses for the creation of new and improved products and processes were $68,058, $62,397 and $53,730, for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Environmental Obligations The Company recognizes the potential cost for environmental remediation activities when site assessments are made, remedial efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential insurance reimbursements are not recorded. The Company regularly assesses its environmental liabilities through reviews of contractual commitments, site assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.
Net Income per Common Share Basic income per common share is based on the net income for the year divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per common share assumes the exercise of outstanding, dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method. On January17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as March16, 2007 and these additional shares were distributed on March30, 2007. The share information herein reflects the effect of such stock split.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments, which are periodically used by the Company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures, are accounted for on an accrual basis. Income and expense are recorded in the same financial statement caption as that arising from the related asset or liability. For example, amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are recognized as an increase or decrease of interest expense in the periods in which they accrue. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reflected in net income in a manner that matches the timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with the hedged transaction. As of December31, 2008, the Company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the 33 Table of Contents Companys LIBOR interest rate on $150,000, $250,000 and $250,000 of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December2009, December2009 and July2010, respectively.
Recent Accounting Changes In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (1)recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2)recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (3)determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 141R are: (1)that SFAS 141R requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred; (2)that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance-based liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill; and (3)any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. SFAS 141R is effective for the Company for acquisitions completed on or after January1, 2009.
In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 160 are: (1)SFAS 160 requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests share in income below net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interests share in net income of the Company as is the current practice.) During the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests share in income of $10,426 and $10,518, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2)SFAS 160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders equity. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $19,144 and $14,834, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities. The Company believes the primary impacts of SFAS 160 will be as described above.
In March2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (1)how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (2)how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations; and (3)how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet those objectives, SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly impact its disclosure requirements.
34 Table of Contents Note2Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Long-term debt consists of the following: AverageInterestRate December31, atDecember31,2008 Maturity 2008 2007 Revolving Credit Facility 4.49 % 2011 $ 778,000 $ 711,600 Notes payable to foreign banks and other   debt 5.34 % 2009-2018 8,459 11,036 786,459 722,636 Less current portion 439 1,075 Total long-term debt and capital lease   obligations $ 786,020 $ 721,561 The Companys senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a five-year $1,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in August2011, of which $778,000 was drawn at December31, 2008. At December31, 2008, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $207,200, after a reduction of $14,800 for outstanding letters of credit. The Companys interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Companys credit rating from Standard& Poors was BBB- and from Moodys was Baa3.
As of December31, 2008, The Company had interest rate swap agreements of $150,000, $250,000 and $250,000 that fix the Companys LIBOR interest rate at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December2009, December2009 and July2010, respectively.
The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value of swaps indicated that termination of the agreements at December31, 2008 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $24,957; such loss, net of tax of $9,234, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The maturity of the Companys long-term debt over each of the next five years ending December31, is as follows: 2009 - $439; 2010 - $1,450; 2011 - $778,373; 2012 - $269; 2013 - $5,570; thereafter $358.
The Company estimates that the fair value of its long-term debt approximates book value.
Note 3Fair Value Measurements Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted SFASNo.157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS157 establishes a new framework for measuring fair value of financial and non-financial instruments and expands related disclosures. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. Broadly, the SFAS157 framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. SFAS 157 establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs.
The valuation techniques required by SFAS 157 are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level   1 Quoted   prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level   2 Quoted   prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical   or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived   valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are   observable.
Level   3 Significant   inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
The Company maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available including independent price validation for certain instruments.
35 Table of Contents The Companys only financial instruments subject to SFAS 157 with annual and interim disclosure requirements are derivative instruments which represent interest rate swaps that are independently valued using market observable Level 2 inputs including interest rate yield curves. At December31, 2008, the fair values of derivative instruments were a liability of $24,957.
The Company does not have any other significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Note4Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes are as follows: YearEndedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 Income before taxes: United States $ 173,373 $ 206,922 $ 135,904 Foreign 408,781 294,062 237,368 $ 582,154 $ 500,984 $ 373,272 Current provision: United States $ 63,052 $ 74,900 $ 58,355 Foreign 100,744 64,137 54,653 $ 163,796 $ 139,037 $ 113,008 Deferred provision: United States $ 2,564 $ 11,829 $ 6,667 Foreign (3,357 ) (3,076 ) (2,094 ) (793 ) 8,753 4,573 Total provision for income taxes $ 163,003 $ 147,790 $ 117,581 At December31, 2008, the Company had $23,873 and $4,025 of foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, and state tax credit carryforwards net of federal benefit, respectively, of which $6,117 and $114, respectively, expire or will be refunded at various dates through 2022 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.
A valuation allowance of $9,946 and $6,086 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, has been recorded which relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $3,860 and $1,943 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net change in the valuation allowance in both 2008 and 2007 was related to foreign net operating loss and foreign and state credit carryforwards.
Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Companys effective income tax rate are analyzed below: YearEndedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 U.S. statutory federal tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State and local taxes .6 1.1 1.5 Foreign earnings and dividends taxed at   different rates (8.3 ) (7.3 ) (6.0 ) Valuation allowance .4  .1 Other .3 .7 .9 Effective tax rate 28.0 % 29.5 % 31.5 % 36 Table of Contents The Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding a valuation allowance, were comprised of the following: December31, 2008 2007 Deferred tax assets relating to: Accrued liabilities and reserves $ 10,138 $ 3,404 Operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 10,683 6,182 Pensions, net 35,666 12,194 Interest rate derivatives 9,234 4,365 Inventory reserves 12,734 11,170 Employee benefits 14,275 9,753 $ 92,730 $ 47,068 Deferred tax liabilities relating to: Goodwill $ 35,081 $ 30,436 Depreciation 437 1,643 $ 35,518 $ 32,079 On July13, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No.109, Accounting for Income Taxes and provides guidance on classification and disclosure requirements for tax contingencies. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January1, 2007. The total amount of the liability accrued for unrecognized tax benefits as of the adoption date was approximately $30,000, which includes interest and penalties. As a result of the implementation in 2007, the Company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction in retained earnings of approximately $200. At December31, 2008, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $35,666. As of December31, 2008, the Company does not have any tax positions for which management believes it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
A tabular reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at the beginning and end of the year for both 2008 and 2007 is as follows: 2008 2007 Unrecognized tax benefits as of   January1 $ 29,412 $ 26,429 Gross increases and gross decreases for tax   positions in prior periods 964 1,003 Gross increases - current period tax   position 4,140 5,752 Settlements (19 ) (1,677 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (3,225 ) (2,095 ) Unrecognized tax benefits as of   December31 $ 31,272 $ 29,412 The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the year ended December31, 2008, the provision for income taxes included $760 in estimated interest and penalties. As of December31, 2008, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included $6,652 for tax-related interest and penalties.
The Company files income tax returns with the U.S., various states as well as foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or after 2005.
Note5Shareholders Equity The Company has two option plans for employees (the Option Plans), the 1997 Option Plan and the 2000 Option Plan. The Option Plans authorize the granting of additional stock options by a committee of the Board of Directors. At December31, 2008, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the Option Plans was 37 Table of Contents 3,829,560. Options granted under the Option Plans vest ratably over a period of five years and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. In addition, shares issued in conjunction with the exercise of stock options under the Option Plans are subject to Management Stockholder Agreements.
In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the Directors Option Plan). The Directors Option Plan is administered by the Board of Directors. At December31, 2008, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the Directors Option Plan was 260,000. Options granted under the Directors Option Plan vest ratably over a period of three years and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of the Company and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and historical post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on the Companys dividend rate.
Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods.
Stock option activity for 2006, 2007 and 2008 was as follows (on a post stock split basis): Options Weighted   Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Options outstanding at December31,   2005 12,787,012 $ 12.34 6.44 Options granted 2,275,200 26.82 Options exercised (2,035,946 ) 10.75 Options cancelled (110,840 ) 16.44 Options outstanding at December31,   2006 12,915,426 15.11 6.34 Options granted 2,247,500 34.61 Options exercised (3,248,008 ) 10.79 Options cancelled (635,020 ) 25.45 Options outstanding at December31,   2007 11,279,898 19.72 6.55 Options granted 2,142,700 45.93 Options exercised (2,063,881 ) 13.12 Options cancelled (128,880 ) 28.94 Options outstanding at December31,   2008 11,229,837 25.82 6.69 $ 52,850 Exercisable at December31, 2008 5,376,999 $ 16.52 5.10 $ 46,352 A summary of the status of the Companys non-vested options as of December31, 2008 and changes during the year then ended is as follows: Options WeightedAverageFair ValueatGrantDate Non-vested options at December31,   2007 5,681,951 $ 8.24 Options granted 2,142,700 14.79(1 ) Options vested (1,842,933 ) 6.92 Options cancelled (128,880 ) 9.37 Non-vested options at December31,   2008 5,852,838 $ 11.03 38 Table of Contents (1) The weighted-average fair value at grant date of options granted during 2007 and 2006 were $10.98 and $9.20, respectively.

The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share. The Company paid its fourth quarterly dividend in the amount of $2,567 or $.015 per share on January7, 2009 to shareholders of record as of December17, 2008. Cumulative dividends declared during 2008 were $10,461. Total dividends paid in 2008 were $10,617 including those declared in 2007 and paid in 2008.

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common shares outstanding, which relates to stock options. A reconciliation of the basic average common shares outstanding to diluted average common shares outstanding as of December31 is as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 39 Table of Contents 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 419,151 $ 353,194 $ 255,691 Basic average common shares outstanding 175,663,797 178,453,249 178,927,644 Effect of dilutive stock options 3,149,216 4,050,720 4,419,682 Dilutive average common shares outstanding 178,813,013 182,503,969 183,347,326 Earnings per share: Basic $ 2.39 $ 1.98 $ 1.43 Dilutive $ 2.34 $ 1.94 $ 1.39 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive shares of 5.9 million, nil and 2.2 million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Note7Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (U.S. Plan), which, subject to the curtailment described below, covers its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plan are covered by defined contribution plans. The following is a summary of the Companys defined benefit plans funded status as of the most recent actuarial valuations; for each year presented below, projected benefits exceed assets.

The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The Companys U.S. Plan comprised the majority of the accrued benefit obligation, pension assets and pension expense. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan was 6.25% at both December31, 2008 and 2007. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately $15,500.
Effective January1, 2007, the Company effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2,900. For affected employees, the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1,900 and $1,700 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on U.S. Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its historical nineteen-year compounded return of 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 9%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.8% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 6%. As of December31, 2008, the asset allocation was 45% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers and 18% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December31, 2008 and 2007 is 8.25% and 9.25%, respectively. This reduction in the long-term rate of return will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2009 by approximately $2,400.
The Company has also adopted an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory 41 Table of Contents limitations on average compensation for purposes of the benefit computation. The largest non-U.S. pension plan, in accordance with local custom, is unfunded and had a projected benefit obligation of approximately $48,000 and $51,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such obligation is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the tables above.
The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20,000 in both 2008 and 2007, and the U.S. Plan made benefit payments of $16,450 and $15,800 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under all the Companys pension and post-retirement benefit plans (the Plans) increased in 2008 to $165,889, ($4,220 of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2009 for foreign plans) from $101,804 in 2007 primarily due to a significant reduction in plan assets in the U.S. Plan offset by the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2008 and by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2009 of approximately $15,000 to $20,000. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which was signed into law in August2006. The Pension Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. Effective January1, 2007, in conjunction with the curtailment of certain additional U.S. Pension Plan benefits for salaried employees described above, the Company began matching the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company provided matching contributions of approximately $1,900 for the year ended December31, 2008.
The Company maintains self-insurance programs for that portion of its health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retirees through post-retirement benefit programs. The Companys share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees. The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. Since the Companys obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and since the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and the net postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Companys financial condition or results of operations, the Company believes any change in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the Company. The discount rate used in determining the APBO was 6.25% at both December31, 2008 and 2007. Summary information on the Companys postretirement medical plans is as follows: December31, 2008 2007 Change in benefit obligation: Accrued benefit obligation at beginning of   year $ 14,832 $ 15,249 Service cost 173 178 Interest cost 888 864 Paid benefits and expenses (816 ) (1,405 ) Actuarial loss (450 ) (54 ) Accrued benefit obligation at end of year $ 14,627 $ 14,832 YearendedDecember31, 2008 2007 2006 Components of net post-retirement benefit   cost: Service cost $ 173 $ 178 $ 134 Interest cost 888 864 745 Amortization of transition obligation 62 62 62 Net amortization of actuarial losses 984 1,151 1,069 Net postretirement benefit cost $ 2,107 $ 2,255 $ 2,010 42 Table of Contents Note8Leases At December31, 2008, the Company was committed under operating leases which expire at various dates. Total rent expense under operating leases for the years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $24,044, $25,176 and $23,441, respectively.
Minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 2009 $ 20,945 2010 17,161 2011 13,234 2012 9,645 2013 7,722 Beyond 2013 8,264 Total minimum obligation $ 76,971 Note9Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As of December31, 2008, the Company has goodwill totaling $1,232,335, of which $1,158,786 related to the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment with the remainder related to the Cable Products segment. In 2008, goodwill increased by $140,507 primarily as a result of recording liabilities for performance-based additional cash consideration related to acquisitions of approximately $131,700, which was related to the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. In addition, the Company made three acquisitions in the Interconnect and Product Assemblies segment with an aggregate acquisition price of approximately $84,100 less the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of $35,000. These increases were offset by a reclassification of $14,100 from goodwill to other long-term assets, which represents the fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets associated with the Companys acquisitions in 2007, and a reduction due to currency translation of approximately $25,000. The Company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes of the assets acquired related to its 2008 acquisitions and anticipates that the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment.
The Company does not have any intangible assets not subject to amortization other than goodwill. As of December31, 2008, the Company has acquired amortizable intangible assets with a total gross carrying amount of approximately $81,600, of which $36,700, $31,400 and $6,000 relate to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable intangible assets. The accumulated amortization related to these intangibles as of December31, 2008 totaled approximately $25,000 of which $6,600, $9,800 and $2,200 relate to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable intangible assets. As of December31, 2007, the Company had acquired amortizable intangible assets with a total gross carrying amount of $53,500, of which $30,700, $9,500 and $6,000 related to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable intangible assets. The accumulated amortization related to these intangibles as of December31, 2007 totaled approximately $14,800, of which $4,200, $4,000 and $1,600 related to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable intangible assets. Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of approximately 9 years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 4.5 years, respectively. The aggregate amortization expense for the year ended December31, 2008 was approximately $9,800 and amortization expense estimated for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $11,000 in 2009, $10,000 in 2010, $8,300 in 2011, $8,100 in 2012 and $4,800 in 2013.

For the year ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded charges of $20,747 for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June28 to July14, 2006 but the plant was substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of 2006.
Note13Commitments and Contingencies In the course of pursuing its normal business activities, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Management does not expect that amounts, if any, which may be required to be paid by reason of such proceedings or claims will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation (Allied Signal) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell InternationalInc. in December1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the Route 8 landfill and the Richardson Hill Road landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site, the Sidney landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the Honeywell Agreement) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.
