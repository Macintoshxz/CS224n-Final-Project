Interconnect Products and Assemblies.
The Company produces a broad range of interconnect products and assemblies primarily for voice, video and data communication systems, commercial and military aerospace systems, automotive and mass transportation applications, and industrial and factory automation equipment. Interconnect products include connectors, which when attached to an electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device, facilitate electronic or fiber optic transmission. Interconnect assemblies generally consist of a system of cable and connectors for linking electronic and fiber optic equipment. The Company designs and produces a broad range of connector and cable assembly products used in communication applications, such as: engineered cable assemblies used in base stations for wireless communication systems and internet networking equipment; smart card acceptor devices used in mobile GSM telephones, cable modems and other applications to facilitate reading data from smart cards; fiber optic couplers and connectors used in fiber optic signal transmission; input/output connectors and assemblies used for servers and data storage devices and linking personal computers and peripheral equipment; and sculptured flexible circuits used for integrating printed circuit boards in communication applications. The Company also designs and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector products used in telecommunications, computer and office equipment, instrumentation equipment and local area networks. The Companys radio frequency interconnect products and assemblies are also used in base stations, mobile communication devices and other components of cellular and personal communications networks.
The Company believes that it is the largest supplier of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors. Such connectors require superior performance and reliability under conditions of stress and in hostile environments. High performance environmental connectors are generally used to interconnect electronic and fiber optic systems in sophisticated aerospace, military, commercial and industrial equipment. These applications present demanding technological requirements in that the connectors can be 3 subject to rapid and severe temperature changes, vibration, humidity and nuclear radiation. Frequent applications of these connectors include aircraft, guided missiles, radar, military vehicles, equipment for spacecraft, energy, medical instrumentation, geophysical applications and off-road construction equipment. The Company also designs and produces industrial interconnect products used in a variety of applications such as factory automation equipment, mass transportation applications including railroads and marine transportation; and automotive safety products including interconnect devices and systems used in automotive airbags, pretensioner seatbelts, antilock braking systems and other on board automotive electronic systems. The Company also designs and produces highly-engineered cable and backplane assemblies. Such assemblies are specially designed by the Company in conjunction with OEM customers for specific applications, primarily for computer, wired and wireless communication systems, office equipment and aerospace applications. The cable assemblies utilize the Companys connector and cable products as well as components purchased from others.
Cable Products.
The Company designs, manufactures and markets coaxial cable primarily for use in the cable television industry. The Company manufactures two primary types of coaxial cable: semi-flexible, which has an aluminum tubular shield, and flexible, which has one or more braided metallic shields. Semi-flexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution portion of cable television systems, and flexible cable (also known as drop cable) is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television subscribers residence. Flexible cable is also used in other communication applications. The Company has also developed a broad line of radio frequency connectors for coaxial cable and fiber optic interconnect components for full service cable television/telecommunication networks.
The rapid development in fiber optic technologies, digital compression (which allows several channels to be transmitted within the same bandwidth that a single analog channel currently requires) and other communication technologies, including the Companys development of higher capacity coaxial cable, have resulted in technologies that enable cable television systems to provide channel capacity in excess of 500 channels. Such expanded channel capacity, along with other component additions, permit cable operators to offer full service networks with a variety of capabilities including near video-on-demand, pay-per-view special events, home shopping networks, interactive entertainment and education services, telephone services and high-speed access to data resources such as the Internet. With respect to expanded channel capacity systems, cable operators have generally adopted, and the Company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue to adopt, a cable system using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable. Such systems combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear signals over a long distance without amplification, with the advantages of coaxial cable in ease of installation, low cost and compatibility with the receiving components of the customers communication devices. The Company believes that while system operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk and feeder portions of the cable systems, there will be an ongoing need for high capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and street-to-the-home portions of the cable system. In addition, U.S. cable system designs are increasingly being employed in international markets where cable television penetration is generally lower than in the U.S. The Company believes the development of cable television systems in international markets presents a significant opportunity to increase sales of its coaxial cable products.
The Company is also a leading producer of flat-ribbon cable, a cable made of wires assembled side by side such that the finished cable is flat. Flat-ribbon cable is used to connect internal components in systems with space and component configuration limitations. The product is used in computer and office equipment components as well as in a variety of telecommunication applications.
4 International Operations The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Approximately 53% of the Companys sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 were outside the United States. Approximately 49% of such international sales were in Europe. The Company has manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and Estonia and sales offices in most European markets. The Companys European operations generally have strong positions in their respective local markets. The balance of the Companys international activities are located in Asia, Canada, Latin America and Australia. Asian operations include manufacturing facilities in Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, India and Malaysia. The Companys international manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the respective local markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Companys other operations around the world. The Company has low cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in Mexico, China, India and Eastern Europe to serve regional and world markets.
Customers The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company sells its products to over 10,000 customer locations worldwide. The Companys products are sold both directly to OEMs, cable system operators, telecommunication companies and through manufacturers representatives and distributors. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company has concentrated its efforts on service and productivity improvements including advanced computer aided design and manufacturing systems, statistical process controls and just-in-time inventory programs to increase product quality and shorten product delivery schedules. The Companys strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company has achieved a preferred supplier designation from many of its OEM customers.
The Companys sales to distributors represented approximately 20% of the Companys 2002 sales. The Companys recognized brand names, including Amphenol, Times Fiber, Tuchel, Socapex, Sine, Spectra-Strip, Pyle-National, Matrix, Kai Jack and others, together with the Companys strong connector design-in position (products that are specified in customer drawings), enhance its ability to reach the secondary market through its network of distributors.
Manufacturing The Company employs advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations as well as proprietary process technology for flat-ribbon and coaxial cable production. The Companys manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. Outsourcing of certain fabrication processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards.
5 The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to lower its production costs and to improve service to customers. The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis with manufacturing and assembly operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia. To better serve high volume OEM customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near major customers.
The Companys policy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company has undertaken programs to rationalize its production facilities, reduce expenses and maximize the return on capital expenditures. The programs to improve productivity are ongoing.
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, brass, steel, copper and bimetallic products used for cable, contacts and connector shells; and plastic materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is not dependent upon any one source for raw materials, or if one source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements.
Research and Development The Companys research and development expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes were $24.2 million, $22.6 million and $23.5 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys research and development activities focus on selected product areas and are performed by individual operating divisions. Generally, the operating divisions work closely with OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products and systems that meet customer needs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period.
Trademarks and Patents The Company owns a number of active patents worldwide. While the Company considers its patents to be valuable assets, the Company does not believe that its competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that its operations are dependent on any individual patent. The Company regards its trademarks Amphenol, Times Fiber, Tuchel, Socapex, Sine, Spectra-Strip, Pyle-National, Matrix, Kai Jack and others to be of value in its businesses. The Company has exclusive rights in all its major markets to use these registered trademarks.
Competition The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. In the area of coaxial cable for cable television, the Company believes that it and CommScope are the primary world providers of such cable; however, CommScope is larger than the Company in this market. In addition, the Company faces competition from other companies that have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the coaxial cable market.
6 Backlog The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled orders was $224.0 million and $229.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demands and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Companys business, such as sales to the cable television industry, distributors, the computer industry, and other commercial customers, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.
Employees As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 11,100 full-time employees worldwide. Of these employees, approximately 8,300 were hourly employees and the remainder were salaried. The Company had a one week strike in October 1995 at its Sidney, New York facility relating to the renewal of the labor contract at that facility with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The Company has not had any other significant work stoppages in the past ten years. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.

Unforeseen interruptions to the Companys business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from, but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions or inventory excesses.
8 Item 2. Properties The Companys fixed assets include certain plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Companys plants, warehouses, machinery and equipment are in good operating condition, are well maintained, and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December 31, 2002, the Company operated a total of 76 plants and warehouses of which (a) the locations in the U.S. had approximately 1.9 million square feet, of which .8 million square feet were leased; and (b) the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 2.4 million square feet, of which 1.3 million square feet were leased.
The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in several legal actions in which various amounts are claimed arising from normal business activities. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be precisely determined, in the opinion of management, such matters are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29.1 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities.
Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal 9 activity. The Company is currently performing monitoring activities at its manufacturing site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also performing monitoring, investigation, design and cleanup activities at three off-site disposal sites previously utilized by the Companys Sidney facility and others, the Richardson Hill landfill, the Route 8 landfill and the Sidney Center landfill. The Company and Honeywell have entered into an administrative consent order with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) and are presently determining necessary and appropriate remedial measures for Richardson Hill, which has been designated a Superfund site on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. With respect to the second site, the Route 8 landfill, the Company initiated a remediation program pursuant to a Consent Order with the New York Department of Environmental Protection and is continuing to monitor the results of those remediation efforts. In December 1995, the Company and Honeywell received a letter from the EPA demanding that the Company and Honeywell accept responsibility for the investigation and cleanup of the third site, Sidney Center landfill, another Superfund Site. The Sidney Center landfill was a municipal landfill site utilized by the Companys Sidney facility and other local towns and businesses. In 1996, the Company and Honeywell received a unilateral order from the EPA directing the Company and Honeywell to perform certain investigation, design and cleanup activities at the Sidney Center landfill site. The Company and Honeywell responded to the unilateral order by agreeing to undertake certain remedial design activities. In 1997, the EPA filed a lawsuit against the Company and Honeywell seeking reimbursement of past costs expended by the EPA in connection with activities at the Sidney Center landfill site and seeking to affix liability upon the Company and Honeywell for all additional costs to be incurred in connection with all further investigations, design and cleanup activities at the Sidney Center landfill site. The Company joined four local municipalities as co-defendants in the lawsuit. In 2001 the Company and Honeywell were ordered by the Court to pay the EPA approximately $3.5 million, net of contributions by the municipalities who had been joined as co-defendants in the lawsuit. Pursuant to that decision the Company and Honeywell will be responsible for completing the remedial design work and for implementing any agreed remediation plan at the Sidney Center landfill site. The municipalities who were joined in the lawsuit have agreed to monitor and maintain any caps installed at the Sidney Center landfill site as part of any remediation plan. The Company and Honeywell will be responsible for continuing groundwater monitoring at the site. The Company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other off-site disposal sites. During 2002, the Company incurred costs of approximately $.7 million, net of indemnification payments received from Honeywell, in connection with investigating, remediating and monitoring environmental conditions at all of these facilities and sites. In 2003 Amphenol expects such expenditures, net of expected indemnification payments from Honeywell, to be less than $1.0 million.
Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes that all of its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon all information currently known by management about the Companys manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all known environmental matters, that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations.

Managements Discussion and   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein.
Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.
Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales,   excluding depreciation and amortization 65.9 63.8 65.2 Depreciation and   amortization expense 3.3 2.9 2.1 Selling, general   and administrative expense 14.4 14.1 13.7 Amortization of   goodwill 1.3 1.0 Operating income 16.4 17.9 18.0 Interest expense (4.3 ) (5.1 ) (4.6 ) Other expenses,   net (.5 ) (.5 ) (.7 ) Income before   income taxes 11.6 12.3 12.7 Provision for   income taxes (4.0 ) (4.7 ) (4.8 ) Net income 7.6 % 7.6 % 7.9 % 2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales were $1,062.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8 million for 2001. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3 million in 2002 versus $906.8 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales (approx. $52.8 million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3 million) of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. Sales of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7 million in 2002 versus $197.0 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term.
Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1 million in 2002 versus $538.9 million in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($560.9 million in 2002 versus $564.8 million in 2001) and decreased approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $14.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001.
The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for 2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and the adverse effect on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reduction programs. The pricing environment in communication related markets is expected to remain difficult in the near term.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both 2002 and 2001.
Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a result of adopting FAS No. 142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3 million in 2001.
Interest expense was $45.9 million for 2002 compared to $56.1 million for 2001. The decrease is 14 primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2003 is expected to be approximately $35 million.
Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net.
The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 35% compared to 38% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax rate, excluding non-deductible goodwill amortization, was 35%.
2001 Compared to 2000 Net sales were $1,103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $1,359.7 million for 2000. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 10% compared to 2000 ($906.8 million in 2001 versus $1,009.2 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace and automotive markets. Sales of cable products decreased 44% compared to 2000 ($197.0 million in 2001 versus $350.5 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by certain U.S. and international cable television operators.
Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2001 decreased approximately 25% compared to 2000 ($538.9 million in 2001 versus $714.8 million in 2000); international sales for 2001 decreased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($564.8 million in 2001 versus $644.9 million in 2000) and decreased approximately 9% in local currency compared to 2000. The comparatively strong U.S. dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $22.8 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2000.
The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained relatively constant at approximately 33% for both 2001 and 2000. Cost reduction activities in 2001 contributed to offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both 2001 and 2000.
Interest expense was $56.1 million for 2001 compared to $61.7 million for 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates.
Other expenses, net for 2001 and 2000 was $5.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net.
The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 38% for both 2001 and 2000.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $131.6 million, $118.9 million, and $154.2 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non-cash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income. In 2001, the decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges and to a net increase in non-cash components of working capital.
Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($18.8 million, $38.6 million and $53.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively), and acquisitions ($33.8 million, $60.5 million, and $67.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively).
The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement) which includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $150 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, the Tranche A had a balance of $179.5 million and matures over the period 2003 to 2004, and the Tranche B had a balance of $284.5 million and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The revolving credit facility expires in 2004; and, availability under the facility at December 31, 2002 was $142.8 million, after reduction of $7.2 million for outstanding letters of credit. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank Agreement also requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests, and 15 includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness and restricted payments, including dividends on the Companys common stock.
The Company is currently pursuing a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. The new credit facilities would be used to replace the Companys existing credit facilities, and may be used to redeem all or a portion of the Companys outstanding senior subordinated notes.
A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60.0 million of accounts receivable and expires in July 2003 with respect to an additional $25.0 million of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2002, approximately $63.2 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its 9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (Notes). The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Companys accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the Companys products, a deterioration in certain of the Companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Companys accounts receivable.
The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2003 will be approximately $28 million. The Companys required debt and capital lease amortization in 2003 is $78.4 million; the Companys required cash interest payments for 2003, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $33 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions.
Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2002, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Long-Term Debt $ 642,275 $ 77,026 $ 234,574 $ 330,675 Capital Lease   Obligations 1,973 1,337 636 Operating Leases 37,820 12,968 13,376 4,923 6,553 Purchase   Obligations 39,958 37,633 2,015 223 87 Other Long-Term   Liabilities 3,250 1,125 1,125 1,000 Total $ 725,276 $ 130,089 $ 251,726 $ 336,821 $ 6,640 16 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29.1 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs.
Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials.
Recent Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and FAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. FAS No. 143 addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. FAS No. 144 addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. There was no effect to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. The statement is effective beginning January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002 and had no material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 17 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (Plan) covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees.
Our pension cost (credit) for all pension plans approximated $.7 million, $(.3) million and $(.3) million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical 13 year compounded return of 10.8%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2002 was 50% with equity managers and 50% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption by 100 basis points to 9.5% beginning in 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million.
The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 7.25% at December 31, 2001 to 6.5% at December 31, 2002. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $9.5 million or increased $10.4 million, respectively.
The financial markets have declined significantly in recent years, which has had an adverse effect on Plan assets. In 2002, this resulted in a $42.5 million non-cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders equity. Such charge represents an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0 million, net of deferred taxes. The Company estimates that, based on 18 current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plans in 2003 of approximately $7.0 million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys significant accounting policies are set forth below.
Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand.
Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions.
The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the Companys sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital; although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company had two fixed rate interest swap agreements totaling $450 million that expired in 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Companys average LIBOR rate was 1.9%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2002 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.3 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2003, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.
19 Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Management Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other information appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments. The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls and procedures intended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in accordance with managements authorization.
Deloitte & Touche LLP has been engaged to audit the financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. They obtain an understanding of the Companys accounting policies and controls, and conduct such tests and related procedures as they consider necessary to arrive at their opinion. The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee composed of outside directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with representatives of management and Deloitte & Touche LLP to discuss and review their activities with respect to internal accounting controls and financial reporting and auditing.
Independent Auditors Report To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amphenol Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

24 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Operations Amphenol Corporation (Amphenol or the Company) is in two business segments which consist of manufacturing and selling interconnect products and assemblies, and manufacturing and selling cable products.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial statements to conform to the 2002 classifications.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Short-Term Cash Investments Cash and short-term cash investments consist of cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value of those instruments.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. The principal components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.
Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment are provided on a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite basis by asset group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful lives of such assets which range from 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment and 20 to 40 years for buildings. It is the Companys policy to periodically review fixed asset lives.
Deferred Debt Issuance Costs Deferred debt issuance costs are being amortized on the interest method over the term of the related debt and such amortization is included in interest expense.
Goodwill Through December 31, 2001, for acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001, the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was being amortized on the straight-line basis over a period of 40 years. Accumulated amortization is $148,779 at December 31, 2001. Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, applicable to business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. In accordance with these standards, goodwill resulting from acquisitions after June 30, 2001 is not amortized and beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill for acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001 is not amortized. The Company adopted the additional provisions of FAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002, which include provisions for annual evaluations for impairment of goodwill. In 2002, goodwill increased by $26,399 primarily as a result of five relatively minor acquisitions with a total acquisition price of $26,970, less the fair value of net assets acquired of $4,951, and the acquisition of additional minority interests in two subsidiaries with a purchase price of $6,826 for such interests, less the proportional fair value of net assets acquired of $2,446. The increase in goodwill by segment was $21,322 and $5,077 for interconnect products and assemblies and cable products, respectively. Pro forma information for 2001 and 2000 as if goodwill had not been amortized is as follows: 25 2001 2000 Earnings   Per Share Earnings   Per Share Net Income Basic Diluted Net Income Basic Diluted As reported $ 83,710 $ 2.00 $ 1.95 $ 107,904 $ 2.59 $ 2.52 Goodwill   amortization 14,340 .34 .33 13,394 .33 .31 Pro forma $ 98,050 $ 2.34 $ 2.28 $ 121,298 $ 2.92 $ 2.83 Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products.
Retirement Pension Plans Costs for retirement pension plans include current service costs and amortization of prior service costs over periods of up to thirty years. It is the Companys policy to fund current pension costs taking into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized during the employees service with the Company as well as amortization of a transition obligation recognized on adoption of the accounting principle.
Stock Options The Company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plans. Had compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair value of the option at date of grant consistent with the provisions of FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: 2002 2001 2000 Net income $ 80,344 $ 83,710 $ 107,904 Less: Total   stock based compensation expense determined under Black-Scholes option   pricing model, net of related tax effects (6,559 ) (8,636 ) (6,006 ) Pro forma net   income $ 73,785 $ 75,074 $ 101,898 Earnings Per   Share: Basic-as   reported $ 1.89 $ 2.00 $ 2.59 Basic-pro forma $ 1.74 $ 1.79 $ 2.45 Diluted-as   reported $ 1.85 $ 1.95 $ 2.52 Diluted-pro   forma $ 1.70 $ 1.75 $ 2.38 The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2002 2001 2000 Risk free   interest rate 2.7 % 4.3 % 5.1 % Expected life 5 years 5 years 4 years Expected   volatility 40.0 % 54.0 % 67.0 % Expected   dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % The weighted-average fair values of options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $17.07, $20.98 and $27.04, respectively.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested.
Foreign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of all of the Companys significant foreign subsidiaries are measured 26 using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been translated at current exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments so calculated is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in other expense, net.
Research and Development Research and development expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes were $24,183, $22,604 and $23,505, for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Environmental Obligations The Company recognizes the potential cost for environmental remediation activities when assessments are made, remedial efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential insurance reimbursements are not recorded. The Company regularly assesses its environmental liabilities through reviews of contractual commitments, site assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.
Net Income per Common Share Basic income per common share is based on the net income for the period divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted income per common share assumes the exercise of outstanding, dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method. In April 2000, the Company effected a two-for-one split of its common stock; all share and per-share amounts in the financial statements have been restated to reflect the split.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments, which are periodically used by the Company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures, are accounted for on an accrual basis. Income and expense are recorded in the same category as that arising from the related asset or liability. For example, amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are recognized as an increase or decrease of interest expense in the periods in which they accrue. The Company adopted FAS 133, as amended by FAS 138, beginning January 1, 2001. Adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of $291 in accumulated other comprehensive income as of that date. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reflected in net income in a manner that matches the timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with the hedged transaction. At December 31, 2002 the Company had no derivative financial instruments.
Recent Accounting Changes Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and FAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. FAS No. 143 addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. FAS No. 144 addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. There was no effect to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. The statement is effective beginning January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002 and have no material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in 27 both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2 - Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consists of the following: December   31, Interest Rate at December 31, 2002 Maturity 2002 2001 Bank Agreement: Term Loan 3.10 % 2003-2006 $ 464,043 $ 527,248 Revolving Credit   Facility 2004 15,100 Senior   Subordinated Notes 9.875 % 2007 144,000 144,000 Notes payable to   foreign banks and other debt .5-7.75 % 2003-2004 36,205 33,971 644,248 720,319 Less current   portion 78,363 59,705 Total long-term   debt $ 565,885 $ 660,614 The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement) which includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $150,000 revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, the Tranche A had a balance of $179,543 and matures over the period 2003 to 2004, and the Tranche B had a balance of $284,500 and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The revolving credit facility expires in 2004; availability under the facility at December 31, 2002 was $142,800, after reduction of $7,200 for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2002, interest under the Bank Agreement generally accrues at .75% to 1.50% over LIBOR. The Company also pays certain annual agency and commitment fees. At December 31, 2001, the Company had interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements that effectively fixed the Companys LIBOR interest rate on $450,000 of floating rate bank debt at 5.76%. Such agreements expired in 2002. While it was not the Companys intention to terminate the interest rate swap agreements, the fair values of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair values indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $14,631 and a pre-tax gain of $448, respectively. At December 31, 2001 the derivatives loss, net of tax, of $8,837 was recorded in other comprehensive income. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank Agreement also requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests, and includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i) incurring debt, (ii) creating or incurring liens, (iii) making other investments, (iv) acquiring or disposing of assets, (v) capital expenditures, and (vi) restricted payments, including dividends on the Companys common stock.
The 9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (Notes) are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes are subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, beginning in 2002 at 104.938% and declining to 100% by 2005.
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. At December 31, 2002, based on market quotes for the same or similar securities it is estimated that the Companys Notes were trading at a premium of approximately 4% over book value. The book value of the Companys other long-term debt approximates fair value.
The maturity of the Companys long-term debt over each of the next five years ending December 31, is as follows: 2003 - $78,363; 2004 - $137,385; 2005 - $97,825; 2006 - $186,675; and 2007 - $144,000.
28 Note 3 - Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Income before   taxes: United States $ 52,337 $ 58,129 $ 79,024 Foreign 70,325 77,226 94,194 $ 122,662 $ 135,355 $ 173,218 Current   provision: United States $ 23,448 $ 26,826 $ 45,799 Foreign 17,185 16,811 25,125 40,633 43,637 70,924 Deferred   provision (benefit): United States $ 1,129 $ 5,841 $ (4,095 ) Foreign 556 2,167 (1,515 ) 1,685 8,008 (5,610 ) Total provision   for income taxes $ 42,318 $ 51,645 $ 65,314 At December 31, 2002, the Company had $9,210 of foreign tax loss carryforward, of which $1,809 expire at various dates through 2009 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance of $1,312 and $1,024 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, has been recorded which relates to foreign net operating loss carryforward. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $288 and $465 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In both 2002 and 2001 the net change in the valuation allowance was related to foreign net operating loss carryforward. Accrued income tax liabilities of $18,861 and $4,560 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are included in other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Companys effective income tax rate are analyzed below: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 U.S. statutory   federal tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State and local   taxes 2.3 1.9 1.6 Non-deductible   purchase accounting differences 3.6 2.7 Foreign earnings   and dividends taxed at different rates (5.2 ) (2.3 ) .9 Valuation   allowance .2 .4 (1.8 ) Other 2.2 (.4 ) (.7 ) Effective tax   rate 34.5 % 38.2 % 37.7 % The Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding a valuation allowance, were comprised of the following: December 31, 2002 2001 Deferred tax   assets: Accrued   liabilities and reserves $ 9,421 $ 15,764 Operating loss   carryforward 2,704 2,586 Pension 26,056 1,203 Employee   benefits 2,475 2,682 $ 40,656 $ 22,235 Deferred tax   liabilities: Depreciation $ 6,454 $ 5,526 29 The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, since the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. The Company is subject to periodic audits of its various tax returns by government agencies; management does not believe that amounts, if any, which may be required to be paid by reason of such audits will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
Note 4 - Shareholders Equity In May 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Option Plan, and in May 2000, adopted the 2000 Option Plan (Plans). The Plans authorize the granting of stock options by a committee of the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2002, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for the granting of stock options under the Plans was 217,065. Options granted under the Plans vest ratably over a period of five years and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. In addition, shares issued in conjunction with the exercise of stock options are generally subject to Management Stockholder Agreements which, among other things, place restrictions on the sale or transfer of such shares.
Stock option activity for 2000, 2001, and 2002 was as follows: Options Average Price Options outstanding at December 31, 1999 2,917,060 $ 14.77 Options granted 1,129,500 49.40 Options   exercised (192,986 ) 13.94 Options   cancelled (98,152 ) 23.51 Options outstanding at December 31, 2000 3,755,422 25.00 Options granted 522,450 40.97 Options   cancelled (58,175 ) 36.22 Options outstanding at December 31, 2001 4,219,697 26.82 Options granted 715,500 43.80 Options   exercised (265,404 ) 14.18 Options   cancelled (45,248 ) 36.54 Options outstanding at December 31, 2002 4,624,545 $ 30.07 The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2002: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise Price Shares Average Price Remaining Term Shares Average Price $ 13.00 1,801,054 $ 13.00 4.38 1,801,054 $ 13.00 15.00-20.00 427,591 18.52 6.21 254,575 18.37 25.00-30.00 123,400 28.73 5.42 96,720 28.80 31.00-40.00 29,000 34.96 7.84 8,800 34.33 41.00-50.00 2,235,000 45.95 8.22 514,130 48.02 55.00-60.00 8,500 56.75 7.76 3,400 56.75 4,624,545 $ 30.07 6.46 2,678,679 $ 20.93 At December 31, 2002, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.

Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the defined benefit plan are covered by defined contribution plans. The following is a summary of the Companys defined benefit plans funded status as of the most recent actuarial valuations (December 31, 2002 and 2001).

The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 10.5% (9.5% in 2003). Plan assets consist primarily of U.S. equity and debt securities. The Company has also adopted an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP) which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory limitations on average compensation for purposes of the benefit computation. The largest non-U.S. pension plan, in accordance with local custom, is unfunded and had an accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $25,170 and $19,356 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Such obligation is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the tables above.
In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 87, the Company has recognized a minimum pension liability at December 31, 2002 of $103,830 ($36,862 at December 31, 2001) for circumstances in which a pension plans accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plans assets and accrued pension liability. Such liability was partially offset by an intangible asset equal to the unrecognized prior service cost, with the balance recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity, net of related deferred tax benefits.
The Company maintains self insurance programs for that portion of its health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retirees through postretirement benefit programs. The Companys share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees. The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. Since the Companys obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and since the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and the net postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Companys financial condition or results of operations, management believes any change in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the Company. The discount rate used in determining the APBO at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 6.5% and 7.25%, respectively.
Summary information on the Companys postretirement medical plans is as follows: December 31, 2002 2001 Change in   benefit obligation: Benefit   obligation at beginning of year $ 13,763 $ 10,835 Service cost 71 75 Interest cost 912 972 Paid benefits   and expenses (1,849 ) (1,620 ) Actuarial loss 525 3,501 Benefit   obligation at end of year $ 13,422 $ 13,763 Funded status $ (13,422 ) $ (13,763 ) Unrecognized net   actuarial loss 10,092 10,499 Unrecognized   transition obligation 621 683 Accrued benefit   cost $ (2,709 ) $ (2,581 ) Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Components of   net postretirement benefit cost: Service cost $ 71 $ 75 $ 61 Interest cost 912 972 819 Amortization of   transition obligation 62 62 62 Net amortization   of actuarial losses 934 975 731 Net   postretirement benefit cost $ 1,979 $ 2,084 $ 1,673 33 Note 6 - Leases At December 31, 2002, the Company was committed under operating leases which expire at various dates through 2008. Total rent expense under operating leases for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $16,007, $16,762 and $17,429, respectively.
Minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 2003 $ 12,968 2004 8,259 2005 5,117 2006 2,956 2007 1,967 Beyond   2007 6,553 Total   minimum obligation $ 37,820 Note 7 - Reportable Business Segments and International Operations The Company has two reportable business segments: interconnect products and assemblies and cable products. The interconnect products and assemblies segment produces connectors and connector assemblies primarily for the communications, aerospace, industrial and automotive markets. The cable products segment produces coaxial and flat ribbon cable and related products primarily for communication markets, including cable television. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described in Note 1 herein. The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest expense, headquarters expense allocations, income taxes and nonrecurring gains and losses. The Companys reportable segments are an aggregation of business units that have similar production processes and products.

Management does not expect that amounts, if any, which may be required to be paid by reason of such proceedings or claims will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (Honeywell)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30,000 and 100% of the costs in excess of $30,000. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29,100 of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided 35 interest of up to $85,000 in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60,000 of accounts receivable and expires in July 2003 with respect to an additional $25,000 of accounts receivable. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold accounts receivable. The aggregate value of receivables transferred to the pool for the year 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $541,834, $598,659, and $833,653, respectively. At December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively, $21,427 and $20,548 of accounts receivable were transferred to the subsidiary, but not purchased by the financial institution and are therefore included in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates the carrying value. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. Program fees payable to the purchaser under this agreement are equivalent to rates afforded high quality commercial paper issuers plus certain administrative expenses and are included in other expenses, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. The agreement contains certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. In certain circumstances the Company is contingently liable for the collection of the receivables sold; management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to absorb the expense of any such liability. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately $63,200 and $74,200, respectively, of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
