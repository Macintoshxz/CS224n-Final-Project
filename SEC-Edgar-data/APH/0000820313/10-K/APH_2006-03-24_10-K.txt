These conditions are frequently encountered in commercial and military aerospace applications and other demanding industrial applications such as oil exploration, medical instrumentation and off-road construction.
Industry analysts estimate that the worldwide market for interconnect products will grow approximately 6% in 2004. The Company believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is highly fragmented with over 2,000 producers of connectors worldwide, of which the 10 largest, including Amphenol, accounted for a combined market share of approximately 50% in 2003. Industry analysts estimate that the total sales for the industry were approximately $32billion in 2003.
4 The Company's Times Fiber subsidiary is the world's second largest producer of coaxial cable for the cable television market. The Company believes that its Times Fiber unit is one of the lowest cost producers of coaxial cable for cable television. The Company's coaxial cable and connector products are used in cable television systems including full service cable television/telecommunication systems being installed by cable operators and telecommunication companies offering video, voice and data services. The Company is also a major supplier of coaxial cable to the developing international cable television market.
The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes. The Company manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in the Americas, Europe and Asia. The Company sells its connector products through its own global sales force and independent manufacturers' representatives to thousands of OEMsin approximately 60 countries throughout the world as well as through a global network of electronics distributors. The Company sells its coaxial cable products primarily to cable television operators and to telecommunication companies who have entered the broadband communications market. For the year 2003, approximately 49% of the Company's net sales were in North America, 27% were in Europe and 24% were in Asia and other countries.
The Company implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers which result in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers' new products and programs. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. By developing application specific products, the Company has decreased its exposure to standard products which generally experience greater pricing pressure. In addition to product design teams and customer collaboration arrangements, the Company uses key account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers. The Company is also focused on making strategic acquisitions in certain markets to further broaden and enhance its product offerings and expand its global capabilities.
Business Segments The following table sets forth the dollar amounts of the Company's net trade sales for its business segments. For a discussion of factors affecting changes in sales by business segment and additional segment financial data, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note7 in the Company's "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 2003 2002 2001 (dollars in thousands) Net trade sales by business segment: Interconnect products and assemblies $ 1,071,968 $ 892,309 $ 906,799 Cable products 167,536 169,693 196,972 $ 1,239,504 $ 1,062,002 $ 1,103,771 Net trade sales by geographic area(1): United States operations $ 555,918 $ 501,073 $ 538,938 International operations 683,586 560,929 564,833 $ 1,239,504 $ 1,062,002 $ 1,103,771 (1) Based on customer location to which product is shipped.
5 Interconnect Products and Assemblies.
The Company produces a broad range of interconnect products and assemblies primarily for voice, video and data communication systems, commercial and military aerospace systems, automotive and mass transportation applications, and industrial and factory automation equipment. Interconnect products include connectors, which when attached to an electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device, facilitate electronic or fiber optic transmission. Interconnect assemblies generally consist of a system of cable and connectors for linking electronic and fiber optic equipment. The Company designs and produces a broad range of connector and cable assembly products used in communication applications, such as: engineered cable assemblies used in base stations for wireless communication systems and internet networking equipment; smart card acceptor devices used in mobile GSM telephones, cable modems and other applications to facilitate reading data from smart cards; fiber optic couplers and connectors used in fiber optic signal transmission; input/output connectors and assemblies used for servers and data storage devices and linking personal computers and peripheral equipment; and sculptured flexible circuits used for integrating printed circuit boards in communication applications. The Company also designs and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector products used in telecommunications, computer and office equipment, instrumentation equipment, local area networks and automotive electronics. The Company's radio frequency interconnect products and assemblies are also used in base stations, mobile communication devices and other components of cellular and personal communications networks.
The Company believes that it is the largest supplier of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors. Such connectors require superior performance and reliability under conditions of stress and in hostile environments. High performance environmental connectors and interconnect systems are generally used to interconnect electronic and fiber optic systems in sophisticated aerospace, military, commercial and industrial equipment. These applications present demanding technological requirements in that the connectors are subject to rapid and severe temperature changes, vibration, humidity and nuclear radiation. Frequent applications of these connectors and interconnect systems include aircraft, guided missiles, radar, military vehicles, equipment for spacecraft, energy, medical instrumentation, geophysical applications and off-road construction equipment. The Company also designs and produces industrial interconnect products used in a variety of applications such as factory automation equipment, mass transportation applications including railroads and marine transportation; and automotive safety products including interconnect devices and systems used in automotive airbags, pretensioner seatbelts, antilock braking systems and other on board automotive electronic systems. The Company also designs and produces highly-engineered cable and backplane assemblies. Such assemblies are specially designed by the Company in conjunction with OEM customers for specific applications, primarily for computer, wired and wireless communication systems, office equipment and aerospace applications. The cable assemblies utilize the Company's connector and cable products as well as components purchased from others.
Cable Products.
The Company designs, manufactures and markets coaxial cable primarily for use in the cable television industry. The Company manufactures two primary types of coaxial cable: semi-flexible, which has an aluminum tubular shield, and flexible, which has one or more braided metallic shields. Semi-flexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution portion of cable television systems, and flexible cable (also known as drop cable) is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television subscriber's residence. Flexible cable is also used in other communication applications. The Company has also developed a broad line of radio frequency connectors for coaxial cable and fiber optic interconnect components for full service cable television/telecommunication networks.
The rapid development in fiber optic technologies, digital compression (which allows several channels to be transmitted within the same bandwidth that a single analog channel requires) and other communication technologies, including the Company's development of higher capacity coaxial cable, have resulted in technologies that enable cable television systems to provide channel capacity in excess 6 of 500 channels. Such expanded channel capacity, along with other component additions, permit cable operators to offer full service networks with a variety of capabilities including near video-on-demand, pay-per-view special events, home shopping networks, interactive entertainment and education services, telephone services and high-speed access to data resources such as the Internet. With respect to expanded channel capacity systems, cable operators have generally adopted, and the Company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue to adopt, a cable system using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable. Such systems combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear signals over a long distance without amplification, with the advantages of coaxial cable in ease of installation, low cost and compatibility with the receiving components of the customer's communication devices. The Company believes that while system operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk and feeder portions of the cable systems, there will be an ongoing need for high capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and street-to-the-home portions of the cable system. In addition, U.S. cable system designs are increasingly being employed in international markets where cable television penetration is generally lower than in the U.S. The Company believes the development of cable television systems in international markets presents a significant opportunity to increase sales of its coaxial cable products.
The Company is also a leading producer of flat-ribbon cable, a cable made of wires assembled side by side such that the finished cable is flat. Flat-ribbon cable is used to connect internal components in systems with space and component configuration limitations. The product is used in computer and office equipment components as well as in a variety of telecommunication applications.
International Operations The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Approximately 55% of the Company's sales for the year ended December31, 2003 were outside the United States. Approximately 48% of such international sales were in Europe. The Company has manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and Estonia and sales offices in most European markets. The balance of the Company's international activities are located in Asia, Canada, Latin America and Australia. Asian operations include manufacturing facilities in Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, India and Malaysia. The Company's international manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the respective local markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company's other operations around the world. The Company has low cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in Mexico, China, India and Eastern Europe to serve regional and world markets.
Customers The Company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3% of net sales for the year ended December31, 2003. The Company sells its products to over 10,000 customer locations worldwide. The Company's products are sold both directly to OEMs, contract manufacturers, cable system operators, telecommunication companies and through manufacturers' representatives and distributors. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company has concentrated its efforts on service and productivity improvements including advanced computer aided design and manufacturing systems, statistical process controls and just-in-time inventory programs to increase product quality and shorten product delivery schedules. The Company's strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a 7 broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company has achieved a preferred supplier designation from many of its OEM customers.
The Company's sales to distributors represented approximately 20% of the Company's 2003 sales. The Company's recognized brand names, including "Amphenol," "Times Fiber," "Tuchel," "Socapex," "Sine," "Spectra-Strip," "Pyle-National," "Matrix," "Kai Jack" and others, together with the Company's strong connector design-in position (products that are specified in customer drawings), enhance its ability to reach the secondary market through its network of distributors.
Manufacturing The Company employs advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations as well as proprietary process technology for flat-ribbon and coaxial cable production. The Company's manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. Outsourcing of certain fabrication processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards.
The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to lower its production costs and to improve service to customers. The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis with manufacturing and assembly operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia. To better serve high volume OEM customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near major customers.
The Company's policy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and maximize the return on capital investments.
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, brass, steel, copper and bimetallic products used for cable, contacts and connector shells; and plastic materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is not dependent upon any one source for raw materials, or if one source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements.
Research and Development The Company's research and development expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes was $26.4million, $24.2million and $22.6million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company's research and development activities focus on selected product areas and are performed by individual operating divisions. Generally, the operating divisions work closely with OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products and systems that meet customer needs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period.
Trademarks and Patents The Company owns a number of active patents worldwide. The Company also regards its trademarks "Amphenol," "Times Fiber," "Tuchel," "Socapex," "Sine," "Spectra-Strip," "Pyle-National," "Matrix," "Kai Jack" and others to be of value in its businesses. The Company has exclusive rights in all its major markets to use these registered trademarks. While the Company considers its patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, the Company does not believe that its competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that its operations are dependent on any individual patent or trademark.
8 Competition The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. In the area of coaxial cable for cable television, the Company believes that it and CommScope are the primary world providers of such cable; however, CommScope is larger than the Company in this market. In addition, the Company faces competition from other companies that have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the coaxial cable market.
Backlog The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled orders was $262million and $224million at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demands and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12months. Significant elements of the Company's business, such as sales to the cable television industry, distributors, the computer industry, and other commercial customers, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.
Employees As of December31, 2003, the Company had approximately 13,900 full-time employees worldwide. Of these employees, approximately 9,200 were hourly employees and the remainder were salaried. The Company had a one week strike in October1995 at its Sidney, New York facility relating to the renewal of the labor contract at that facility with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The Company has not had any other significant work stoppages in the past ten years. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.

Unforeseen intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict and trade wars.
Difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly-acquired businesses.
Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the Company needs to achieve its business objectives.
The risks associated with any technological shifts away from the Company's technologies and core competencies. For example, a technological shift away from the use of coaxial cable in cable television/telecommunication systems could have a substantial impact on the Company's coaxial cable business.
Unforeseen interruptions to the Company's business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from, but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions or inventory excesses.
Item 2. Properties The Company's fixed assets include certain plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Company's plants, warehouses, machinery and equipment are in good operating condition, are well maintained, and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December31, 2003, the Company operated a total of 93 plants and warehouses of which (a)the locations in the U.S. had approximately 2.1million square feet, of which .9million square feet were leased; and (b)the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 2.6million square feet, of which 1.4million square feet were leased.
10 The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in several legal actions in which various amounts are claimed arising from normal business activities. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be precisely determined, in the opinion of management, such matters are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation ("Allied Signal") in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell InternationalInc. in December1999 ("Honeywell")), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the "Honeywell Agreement") entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.
Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. The Company is currently performing monitoring activities at its manufacturing site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also performing design, cleanup, operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three off-site disposal sites previously utilized by the Company's Sidney facility and others, the "Richardson Hill" landfill, the "Route 8" landfill and the "Sidney Center" landfill. The Company and Honeywell have entered into an administrative consent order with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and are presently performing remedial measures for "Richardson Hill", which has been designated a "Superfund" site on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The administrative consent order requires the Company to complete the approved remedial measures and to continue to monitor the site. With respect to the second site, the "Route 8" landfill, the Company initiated a remediation program pursuant to a Consent Order with the 11 New York Department of Environmental Protection and is continuing to monitor the results of those remediation efforts. In December1995, the Company and Honeywell received a letter from the EPA demanding that the Company and Honeywell accept responsibility for the investigation and cleanup of the third site, Sidney Center landfill, another Superfund Site. The Sidney Center landfill was a municipal landfill site utilized by the Company's Sidney facility and other local towns and businesses. In 1996, the Company and Honeywell received a unilateral order from the EPA directing the Company and Honeywell to perform certain investigation, design and cleanup activities at the Sidney Center landfill site. The Company and Honeywell responded to the unilateral order by agreeing to undertake certain remedial design activities. In 1997, the EPA filed a lawsuit against the Company and Honeywell seeking reimbursement of past costs expended by the EPA in connection with activities at the Sidney Center landfill site and seeking to affix liability upon the Company and Honeywell for all additional costs to be incurred in connection with all further investigations, design and cleanup activities at the Sidney Center landfill site. The Company joined four local municipalities as co-defendants in the lawsuit. In 2001 the Company and Honeywell were ordered by the Court to pay the EPA approximately $3.5million, net of contributions by the municipalities who had been joined as co-defendants in the lawsuit. Pursuant to that decision the Company and Honeywell are implementing the approved remedial measures for the Sidney Center landfill site. The municipalities who were joined in the lawsuit have agreed to monitor and maintain the caps installed at the Sidney Center landfill site as part of the approved remediation plan. The Company and Honeywell will be responsible for continuing groundwater monitoring at the site. The Company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other off-site disposal sites. All such environmental matters referred to in this paragraph are covered by the Honeywell Agreement.
Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes that all of its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon all information currently known by management about the Company's manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all known environmental matters, that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations.

PART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters The Company affected the initial public offering of its ClassA Common Stock in November1991. The Company's common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since that time under 12 the symbol "APH." The following table sets forth on a per share basis the high and low prices for the common stock for both 2003 and 2002 as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.
2003 2002 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 43.95 $ 37.00 $ 51.75 $ 40.25 Second Quarter 49.40 38.76 49.00 35.50 Third Quarter 57.67 46.10 42.46 30.11 Fourth Quarter 64.13 52.06 45.81 27.47 As of January30, 2004 there were 64 holders of record of the Company's common stock. A significant number of outstanding shares of common stock are registered in the name of only one holder, which is a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, a securities depository for banks and brokerage firms. The Company believes that there are a significant number of beneficial owners of its common stock.
Since its initial public offering in 1991, the Company has not paid and it does not have any present intention to commence payment of dividends; however, this policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December31, 2003 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document.
Executive Overview The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of interconnect and cable products. In 2003 approximately 55% of the Company's sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are:  communication systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;  a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation, natural resource exploration and automotive applications and;  commercial and military aerospace applications.
The Company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3% of net sales in 2003. The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as 14 it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.
The Company's strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost labor areas.
The Company's strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:  Focus on customer needs  Design and develop application-specific interconnect solutions  Establish a strong global presence in resources and capabilities  Preserve and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure  Maintain a culture of controlling cost  Pursue strategic acquisitions For the year ended December31, 2003, the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,240million, $204million and $104million, respectively; up 17%, 18% and 29%, respectively, from 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased in each of the Company's major markets and geographic regions; sales of cable products were stable with the prior year. Net income benefited from both the increase in operating income and reduced interest expense. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in "Results of Operations" below. In addition, a strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to reduce indebtedness. In 2003, the Company reduced debt by approximately $107million.
Results of Operations The following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.
Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 66.2 65.9 63.8 Depreciation and amortization expense 3.0 3.3 2.9 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.3 14.4 14.1 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 Operating income 16.5 16.4 17.9 Interest expense (2.4 ) (4.3 ) (5.1 ) Other expenses, net (.6 ) (.5 ) (.5 ) Expense for early extinguishment of debt (.8 ) Income before income taxes 12.7 11.6 12.3 Provision for income taxes (4.3 ) (4.0 ) (4.7 ) Net income 8.4 % 7.6 % 7.6 % 15 2003 Compared to 2002 Net sales were $1,239.5million for the year ended December31, 2003 compared to $1,062.0million for 2002. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 20% compared to 2002 ($1,072.0million in 2003 versus $892.3million in 2002). Sales increased in the Company's major end markets including military/aerospace, mobile communications, industrial, automotive and computer/data communications markets. The increases occurred in all major geographic regions, with approximately one third of the increase attributable to the effect of currency translation, as detailed below. The remaining increase was attributable to the continuing development of new application specific and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company's major end markets and acquisitions in 2002 and 2003. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $47million) relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe, and an acquisition ($8million). The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets (approximately $42million) is attributable to the acquisition of companies in North America and China serving the network infrastructure market (approximately $18million) and increases in Asia in sales of handset products. The increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $36million) reflects increases resulting from acquisitions in North America (approximately $16million) and increased sales in Europe. Automotive sales increased approximately $33million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North America reflecting increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars. Sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $23million; a cable assembly acquisition in North America contributed one third of the increase, the remainder reflects increased sales in Europe and Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 1% compared to 2002 ($167.5million in 2003 versus $169.7million in 2002). Such decrease is generally attributable to continuing low levels of capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators for cable system upgrades and expansion. The lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term.
Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2003 increased approximately 11% compared to 2002 ($555.9million in 2003 versus $501.1million in 2002); international sales for 2003 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($683.6million in 2003 versus $560.9million in 2002) and increased approximately 12% in local currency compared to 2002. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2003 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $63.9million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2002.
The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) remained constant at 31% for 2003 and 2002. An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was offset by a decline in margins in the cable products segment. The operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year, the increase is generally attributable to the effects of higher sales volume and cost reduction activities relating to purchased materials and increased activity in low cost labor areas. The increase was offset by a decline in operating profit margins for cable products of approximately 6% compared to the prior year due primarily to higher material costs and change in product mix.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $177.4million and $152.9million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $2.2million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, remained stable, commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.9million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance, pensions and medical benefits.
Interest expense was $29.5million for 2003 compared to $45.9million for 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the 16 second quarter of 2003 (see liquidity and capital resources) and lower average debt levels. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2004 is expected to be approximately $23million.
Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4million in 2003, relate to the refinancing of the Company's senior credit facilities. Such one-time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the Company's Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7million, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9million and other related fees and expenses of $1.8million.
Other expenses, net for 2003 and 2002 was $7.0million and $5.4million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses ($1.3million in 2003 and $2.7million in 2002), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2003 and 2002, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.5million in 2003 and $1.8million in 2002), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($2.4million in 2003 and $1.8million in 2002) and agency and commitment fees on the Company's credit facilities ($.8million in 2003 and $.6million in 2002). In addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds), and in 2002 the Company realized $1.5million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note8 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net.
The provision for income taxes for 2003 was at an effective rate of 34% compared to 34.5% in 2002.
2002 Compared to 2001 Net sales were $1,062.0million for the year ended December31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8million for 2001. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3million in 2002 versus $906.8million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales (approx. $52.8million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. These declines occurred primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a continuing slowdown in communication related markets. Major OEM customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure (including wireless) and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand. Such declines were partially offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3million) of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. The increase in sales of military aerospace products (approximately $12million), relates primarily to the acquisition of a backplane assembly business in North America. The increase in automotive sales (approximately $11million) occurred primarily in North America and relates to the increasing use of electronic componentry in automobiles. The increase in sales in the wireless handset market (approximately $15million), reflects the strong market for these products in Asia. Sales of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7million in 2002 versus $197.0million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators.
Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1million in 2002 versus $538.9million in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($560.9million in 2002 versus $564.8million in 2001) and decreased approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $14.4million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001.
The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for 2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and the adverse effect 17 on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially offset by cost reduction programs relating to purchased materials and services and a shift of headcount from high cost to low cost labor areas.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $152.9million and $155.8million in 2002 and 2001 respectively, and remained constant at approximately 14% of sales. Research and development expenditures increased approximately $1.6million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development. Selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the Broadband market, declined approximately $2.6million, commensurate with sales declines for those products. Administrative expenses were down by approximately $1.5million due to a reduction in compensation cost.
Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a result of adopting FAS No.142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3million in 2001.
Interest expense was $45.9million for 2002 compared to $56.1million for 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates.
Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4million and $5.6million, respectively. Other expenses, net, is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses ($2.7million loss in 2002 and $1.4million gain in 2001), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2002 and strength in 2001, program fees on sale of accounts receivable ($1.8million in 2002 and $3.9million in 2001), reflecting lower receivable sales and fee rates in 2002, minority interests ($1.8million in 2002 and 2001) and agency and commitment fees on the Company's credit facilities ($.6million in 2002 and $.5million in 2001). In addition, in 2002 the Company realized $1.5million of income relating to a license fee settlement. See Note8 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net.
The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 34.5% compared to 38.2% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax rate, excluding non-deductible goodwill amortization, was 35%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $159.4million, $131.6million and $118.9million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income partially offset by a smaller reduction in the 2003 period in non-cash components of working capital. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non-cash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income.
The non-cash components of working capital decreased $1.0million in 2003 due primarily to a $20.8million increase in accounts payable, an operating reduction of $4.6million in inventory, and an increase of $10.2million in accrued liabilities partially offset by a $28.8million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels.
The non-cash components of working capital decreased $15.8million in 2002 due primarily to a $12.9million decrease in inventory as inventory levels were reduced in response to lower sales levels.
The non-cash components of working capital increased $10.0million in 2001. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities declined $74.9million, $44.2million and $34.5million, respectively, for a net $3.8million increase in the non-cash components of working capital. These reductions were driven primarily by lower sales volume, and in the case of accrued liabilities, increased income tax payments. Inventory increased approximately $2.8million; inventory turnover which had improved to 4.6x in 2000 as sales levels significantly increased, returned to historical levels of approximately 3.5x in 2001. In addition, accrued interest declined $2.1million.
18 In 2003, accounts receivable increased $41.2million to $172.5million, due to an increase in sales levels, $9.5million from acquired companies, and a $13.5million increase due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December31, 2003 compared to December31, 2002, partially offset by a $10.6million increase in sales of receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before sales of receivables, remained constant at 66days. Inventory increased $15.7million to $221.4million, primarily due to an increase of $12.9million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December31, 2003 compared to December31, 2002, and $7.4million in inventory from acquired companies which more than offset the operating reduction of $4.6million. Inventory turnover increased to 3.9x at December31, 2003 from 3.5x at December31, 2002. Deferred taxes and other assets decreased $9.4million to $28.4million reflecting the decrease in deferred taxes, the details of which are included in Note3 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill increased $29.5million to $516.3million as a result of acquisitions completed in 2003. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $17.6million to $178.3million reflecting capital expenditures of $30.2million, assets from acquisitions of approximately $11.6million, an increase of $12.3million due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December31, 2003 compared to December31, 2002, and depreciation of $36.5million. Accounts payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $28.3million and $6.5million to $116.8million and $31.1million, respectively, due primarily to an increase in sales levels, liabilities from acquired companies and a $5.7million and $1.7million increase, respectively, due to translation resulting from the comparatively weaker U.S. dollar at December31, 2003 compared to December31, 2002. Other accrued liabilities increased $16.6million to $56.1million relating primarily to an increase in accrued income taxes, liabilities for the purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume.
Cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures ($30.2million, $18.8million and $38.6million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively), and acquisitions ($51.1million, $33.8million and $60.5million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively).
In 2003, cash from operating activities of $159.4million, proceeds from the refinancing of $27.0million, additional sales of receivables of $10.6million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $35.9million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $30.2million, acquisitions of $51.1million, an increase in cash on hand of $2.9million and for a net debt reduction of $148.8million. For 2002, cash from operating activities of $131.6million, cash on hand of $7.3million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of $5.8million were used to fund capital expenditures of $18.8million, acquisitions of $13.0million, a reduction in sales of receivables of $11.0million and a net reduction in bank debt of $81.0million.
During the second quarter 2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities. Borrowings of $625.0million under a new bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement), described below, were used to repay $439.5million outstanding under the Company's previous bank agreement, redeem all outstanding senior subordinated notes totaling $148.7million (including the call premium of $4.7million) and to pay other fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of $8.9million. A prepayment of the new bank loan of $37.0million was made in June with excess borrowing proceeds and cash flow from operations and additional prepayments of $89.0million were made in the second half of 2003. The refinancing had the effect of extending the maturity of the Company's debt coming due in 2003 through 2007.
The Company's new Bank Agreement includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $125.0million revolving credit facility. At December31, 2003, the Tranche A had a balance of $90.0million and matures over the period 2006 to 2008, and the Tranche B had a balance of $409.0million and matures in 2010. The revolving credit facility expires in 2008; availability under the facility at December31, 2003 was $117.2million, after a reduction of $7.8million for outstanding letters of credit. The Company's interest rate on loans under the new Bank Agreement is LIBOR plus 19 200 basis points. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Company's direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. In addition, if the Company's credit rating as assigned by Standard& Poor's or Moody's were to decline to BB- or Ba3, respectively, the Company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the Bank Agreement in substantially all of the Company's U.S. based assets. At December31, 2003, the Company's credit rating from Standard and Poor's was BB+ and from Moody's was Ba2. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 3x (EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage test (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.8x. At December31, 2003, such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement, were 7.82x and 2.49x, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness in excess of $50million for capital leases, $200million for general indebtedness and $200million for acquisition indebtedness, of which approximately $2.1million, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December31, 2003, and restricted payments, including dividends on the Company's Common Stock, in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income, or approximately $39.0million at December31, 2003. In conjunction with entering into the new Bank Agreement the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company's LIBOR interest rate on $250.0million and $150.0million of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively.
The Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service. The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company's revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the Company's accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company's sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in demand for the Company's products, a deterioration in certain of the Company's financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company's accounts receivable.
The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2004 will be approximately $40million. The Company's required debt and capital lease amortization in 2004 is $10.7million; the Company's required cash interest payments for 2004, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $22million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company has not paid, and does not have any present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock; however, this policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Management believes that the Company's working capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
Accounts Receivable Securitization A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85.0million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. The agreement expires in May2004. It is the Company's intention to renew or replace the agreement at expiration on similar terms. At December31, 2003, approximately $73.8million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
20 Environmental Matters Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell InternationalInc. in December1999 "Honeywell"), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.
Inflation and Costs The cost of the Company's products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs.
Risk Management The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials.
Stock Split On January21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will be effective for shareholders of record as of March17, 2004. The Company expects the additional shares to be distributed on or before March29, 2004. The share information included herein does not reflect the effect of such stock split.
Recent Accounting Changes Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.146 (FAS146), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. There was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In November2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others". The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a 21 guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December15, 2002 and have no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.148 (FAS148), "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure". FAS No.148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No.123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January and December2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities". It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. The Company adopted this interpretation in 2003 and there was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In April2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.149 (FAS149), "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In May2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.150 (FAS150), "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. The statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.132R (FAS132R), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." FAS132R amends the disclosure requirements of FAS132 to require additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flow and net periodic benefit cost. The statement is effective in 2003 and the related disclosures have been included in Note5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
22 Pensions The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan ("Plan") covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees.
The pension expense (credit) for all pension plans approximated $6.5million, $.7million and $(.3) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical fourteen year compounded return of 11.4%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. As of December31, 2003, our asset allocation was 63% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% for both 2003 and 2004.
The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 6.5% at December31, 2002 to 6.15% at December31, 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2004 by approximately $.8million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $11.6million or increased $12.8million, respectively.
The financial markets declined significantly in 2002, which had an adverse effect on Plan assets. This resulted in a $42.5million non-cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders' equity. Such charge represented an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0million, net of deferred taxes. The Company made a cash contribution to the U.S. pension plans in 2003 of $10.0million. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations declined modestly in 2003 to $100.3million from $102.4million in 2002, as the positive impact on assets of improved investment returns was offset by the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non-U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2004 of approximately $10million. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of Plan assets.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
23 Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. The Company's significant accounting policies are set forth below.
Revenue RecognitionSales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate.
InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly.
Depreciable AssetsProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the Company has not had any significant impairments.
The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note1 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company's known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December31, 2003, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied: Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years (dollars in thousands) Long-Term Debt $ 541,076 $ 9,588 $ 37,088 $ 85,092 $ 409,308 Capital Lease Obligations 1,883 1,091 792 Operating Leases 40,404 13,424 15,663 6,417 4,900 Purchase Obligations 58,199 57,220 870 109 Other Long-Term Liabilities 8,179 6,691 1,205 205 78 Total $ 649,741 $ 88,014 $ 55,618 $ 91,823 $ 414,286 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company's sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Company's worldwide operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.
24 Interest Rate Risk Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter 2003 as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above. In conjunction with the refinancing, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company's LIBOR interest rate on $250.0million and $150.0million of floating rate debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. At December31, 2003, the Company's average LIBOR rate was 1.8%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December31, 2003 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $.1million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2004, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.
25 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Management Management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other information appearing in this annual report on Form10-K. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management's best estimates and judgments. The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls and procedures intended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in accordance with management's authorization.
Deloitte& Touche LLP has been engaged to audit the financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. They obtain an understanding of the Company's accounting policies and controls, and conduct such tests and related procedures as they consider necessary to arrive at their opinion. The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee composed of outside directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with representatives of management and Deloitte& Touche LLP to discuss and review their activities with respect to internal accounting controls and financial reporting and auditing.
26 Independent Auditors' Report To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amphenol Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January1, 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142.

31 A M P H E N O LC O R P O R A T I O N2 0 0 3A N N U A LR E P O R T Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Operations Amphenol Corporation ("Amphenol" or the "Company") is in two business segments which consist of manufacturing and selling interconnect products and assemblies, and manufacturing and selling cable products.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Short-Term Cash Investments Cash and short-term cash investments consist of cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value of those instruments.
Sale of Receivables A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to $85,000 in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The agreement expires in May2004. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold accounts receivable. The aggregate value of receivables transferred to the pool for the year 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $538,093, $541,834, and $598,659, respectively. At December31, 2003 and 2002, $24,568 and $21,427, respectively, of accounts receivable were transferred to the subsidiary, but not purchased by the financial institution and are therefore included in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates the carrying value. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. Program fees payable to the purchaser under this agreement are equivalent to rates afforded high quality commercial paper issuers plus certain administrative expenses and are included in other expenses, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. The agreement contains certain covenants and provides for various events of termination. At December31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $73,800 and $63,200, respectively, of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
32 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. The principal components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.
Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment are provided on a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite basis by asset group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful lives of such assets which range from 3 to 12years for machinery and equipment and 20 to 40years for buildings. It is the Company's policy to periodically review fixed asset lives.
Deferred Debt Issuance Costs Deferred debt issuance costs are being amortized on the interest method over the term of the related debt and such amortization is included in interest expense.
Goodwill Through December31, 2001, for acquisitions completed prior to July1, 2001, the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was being amortized on the straight-line basis over a period of 40years. Accumulated amortization was $148,779 at December31, 2001. Effective July1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No.141, "Business Combinations" and No.142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," applicable to business combinations completed after June30, 2001. In accordance with these standards, goodwill resulting from acquisitions after June30, 2001 is not amortized and beginning January1, 2002, goodwill for acquisitions completed prior to July1, 2001 is not amortized. The Company adopted the additional provisions of FAS No.142 effective January1, 2002, which include requirements for annual evaluations for impairment of goodwill. The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company's reporting units, in accordance with FAS No.142, as of June30. The Company has defined its reporting units as the operating segments within its two reportable business segments "Interconnect Products and Assemblies" and "Cable Products", as the components of these operating segments have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. As of June30, 2003, the fair market value of the Company's reporting units exceeded the carrying value and therefore no impairment was recognized. In 2002, goodwill increased by $26,399 primarily as a result of five relatively minor acquisitions with a total acquisition price of $26,970, less the fair value of new assets acquired of $4,951 and the acquisition of additional minority interests in two subsidiaries with a purchase price of $6,826 for such interests, less the proportional fair value of net assets acquired of $2,446. The increase in goodwill by segment was $21,322 and $5,077 for interconnect products and assemblies and cable products, respectively. In 2003, goodwill increased by $29,494 primarily as a result 33 of four relatively minor acquisitions with a total acquisition price of $42,957, less the fair value of net assets acquired of $23,989, and the acquisition of additional minority interests and payment of contingent consideration relating to previously acquired subsidiaries of $10,526. The increase in goodwill by segment was $27,494 and $2,000 for interconnect products and assemblies and cable products, respectively. Pro forma information for 2001 as if goodwill had not been amortized is as follows: 2001 Earnings Per Share Net Income Basic Diluted As reported $ 83,710 $ 2.00 $ 1.95 Goodwill amortization 14,340 .34 .33 Pro forma $ 98,050 $ 2.34 $ 2.28 Revenue Recognition Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products.
Retirement Pension Plans Costs for retirement pension plans include current service costs and amortization of prior service costs over periods of up to thirty years. It is the Company's policy to fund current pension costs taking into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized during the employees' service with the Company as well as amortization of a transition obligation recognized on adoption of the accounting principle.
Stock Options The Company applies APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plans. Had compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair value of the option at date of grant consistent with the provisions of FAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based 34 Compensation," the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 103,990 $ 80,344 $ 83,710 Less: Total stock based compensation expense determined under Black-Scholes option pricing model, net of related tax effects (5,148 ) (6,559 ) (8,636 ) Pro forma net income $ 98,842 $ 73,785 $ 75,074 Earnings Per Share: Basic-as reported $ 2.42 $ 1.89 $ 2.00 Basic-pro forma $ 2.30 $ 1.74 $ 1.79 Diluted-as reported $ 2.36 $ 1.85 $ 1.95 Diluted-pro forma $ 2.24 $ 1.70 $ 1.75 The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2003 2002 2001 Risk free interest rate 3.2 % 2.7 % 4.3 % Expected life 5 years 5 years 5 years Expected volatility 30.0 % 40.0 % 54.0 % Expected dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % The weighted-average fair values of options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $12.99, $17.07 and $20.98, respectively.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered.
Foreign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of the Company's significant foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been translated at current exchange rates and related revenues and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments so calculated is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in other expense, net.
35 Research and Development Research and development expenses for the creation of new and improved products and processes were $26,361, $24,183 and $22,604, for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Environmental Obligations The Company recognizes the potential cost for environmental remediation activities when assessments are made, remedial efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential insurance reimbursements are not recorded. The Company regularly assesses its environmental liabilities through reviews of contractual commitments, site assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.
Net Income per Common Share Basic income per common share is based on the net income for the period divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted income per common share assumes the exercise of outstanding, dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method. On January21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that will be effective for shareholders of record as of March17, 2004. The Company expects the additional shares to be distributed on or before March29, 2004. The share information included herein does not reflect the effect of such stock split.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments, which are periodically used by the Company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures, are accounted for on an accrual basis. Income and expense are recorded in the same category as that arising from the related asset or liability. For example, amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are recognized as an increase or decrease of interest expense in the periods in which they accrue. The Company adopted FAS133, as amended by FAS138, beginning January1, 2001. Adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of $291 in accumulated other comprehensive income as of that date. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reflected in net income in a manner that matches the timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with the hedged transaction. At December31, 2003, the Company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the Company's LIBOR interest rate on $250,000 and $150,000 of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. These agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and accounted for as described above.
Recent Accounting Changes Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No.143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" and FAS No.144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". FAS No.143 addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. FAS No.144 addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. There was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
36 Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.146 (FAS146), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. There was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In November2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.45 (FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others". The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December15, 2002 and there was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.148 (FAS148), "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure". FAS No.148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No.123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required by FAS123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January and December2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities". It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it. The Company adopted this interpretation in 2003 and there was no effect to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of such adoption.
In April2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.149 (FAS149), "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FAS133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In May2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.150 (FAS150), "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of 37 both Liabilities and Equity." This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.132R (FAS132R), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." FAS132R amends the disclosure requirements of FAS132 to require additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flow and net periodic benefit cost. The statement is effective in 2003 and the related disclosures have been included in Note5 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note2Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consists of the following: December 31, Interest Rate at December 31, 2003 Maturity 2003 2002 Bank Agreement: Term LoanTranche A 3.2% 2006-2008 $ 90,000 Term LoanTranche B 4.0% 2010 409,000 Revolving Credit Facility 2008 Old Bank Agreement $ 464,043 Senior Subordinated Notes 144,000 Notes payable to foreign banks and other debt 3% to 9.5% 2004-2009 43,959 36,205 542,959 644,248 Less current portion 10,679 78,363 Total long-term debt $ 532,280 $ 565,885 In May2003, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities and redeemed all of its outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes"). The new Bank Agreement ("Bank Agreement") consists of: (1)a $125,000 five-year Revolving Credit Facility, (2)a $125,000 Tranche A Loan (December31, 2003 balance $90,000) and (3)a $500,000 Tranche B Loan (December31, 2003 balance $409,000). At December31, 2003, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $117,193, after a reduction of $7,807 for outstanding letters of credit. In connection with the refinancing, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $10,367 (less tax effects of $3,525) or $.16 per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the call premium on the Notes, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and other related costs. The Company's interest rate on borrowings under the Bank Agreement is LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The Company also pays certain annual agency and commitment fees. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Company's direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital 38 stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. In addition, if the Company's credit rating as assigned by Standard& Poor's or Moody's were to decline to BB- or Ba3, respectively, the Company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the Bank Agreement in substantially all of the Company's U.S. based assets. At December31, 2003, the Company's credit rating from Standard& Poor's was BB+ and from Moody's was Ba2. The Bank Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.8X; at December31, 2003, such ratios as defined in the Bank Agreement were 7.82X and 2.49X, respectively. The Bank Agreement also includes limitations with respect to, among other things, (i)indebtedness in excess of $50,000 for capital leases, $200,000 for general indebtedness, $200,000 for acquisition indebtedness, (of which approximately $2,080, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December31, 2003, respectively), (ii)restricted payments including dividends on the Company's Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent to May2003, or approximately $38,985 at December31, 2003, (iii)creating or incurring liens, (iv)making other investments, (v)acquiring or disposing of assets and (vi)capital expenditures.
In conjunction with the Bank Agreement, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company's LIBOR interest rate on $250,000 and $150,000 of floating rate bank debt at 2.44% and 1.24%, expiring in 2006 and 2004, respectively. While it was not the Company's intention to terminate the interest rate swap agreements, the fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value indicated that termination of the agreements at December31, 2003 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $1,108; such loss, net of tax, of $669 was recorded in other comprehensive income.
The maturity of the Company's long-term debt over each of the next five years ending December31, is as follows: 2004-$10,679; 2005-$10,170; 2006-$27,710; 2007-$40,000; 2008-$45,092; thereafter $409,308.
The Company estimates that the fair value of its long-term debt approximates book value.
39 Note3Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Income before taxes: United States $ 58,560 $ 52,337 $ 58,129 Foreign 99,001 70,325 77,226 $ 157,561 $ 122,662 $ 135,355 Current provision: United States $ 24,483 $ 23,448 $ 26,826 Foreign 17,176 17,185 16,811 41,659 40,633 43,637 Deferred provision: United States $ 11,008 $ 1,129 $ 5,841 Foreign 904 556 2,167 11,912 1,685 8,008 Total provision for income taxes $ 53,571 $ 42,318 $ 51,645 At December31, 2003, the Company had $11,046 of foreign tax loss carryforwards, of which $2,319 expire at various dates through 2008 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance of $2,063 and $1,312 at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, has been recorded which relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $751 and $288 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In both 2003 and 2002 the net change in the valuation allowance was related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Accrued income tax liabilities of $24,315 and $18,861 at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are included in other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company's effective income tax rate are analyzed below: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 U.S. statutory federal tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State and local taxes 1.6 2.3 1.9 Non-deductible purchase accounting differences 3.6 Foreign earnings and dividends taxed at different rates (1.7 ) (5.2 ) (2.3 ) Valuation allowance .5 .2 .4 Other (1.4 ) 2.2 (.4 ) Effective tax rate 34.0 % 34.5 % 38.2 % 40 The Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding a valuation allowance, were comprised of the following: December 31, 2003 2002 Deferred tax assets relating to: Accrued liabilities and reserves $ 5,657 $ 9,421 Operating loss carryforward 3,339 2,704 Pensions 20,564 26,056 Employee benefits 2,605 2,475 $ 32,165 $ 40,656 Deferred tax liabilities relating to: Depreciation $ 8,001 $ 6,454 The deferred tax asset relating to pension in the table above includes $36,483 and $36,203 at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to the Company's additional minimum pension liability (Note5).
The Company is subject to periodic audits of its various tax returns by government agencies; management does not believe that amounts, if any, which may be required to be paid by reason of such audits will have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
Note4Shareholders' Equity In May1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Option Plan, and in May2000, adopted the 2000 Option Plan ("Plans"). The Plans authorize the granting of stock options by a committee of the Board of Directors. At December31, 2003, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for the granting of stock options under the Plans was 1,169,435. Options granted under the Plans vest ratably over a period of five years and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. In addition, shares issued in conjunction with the exercise of stock options are generally subject to Management Stockholder Agreements which, among other things, place restrictions on the sale or transfer of such shares.

Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the defined benefit plan are covered by defined contribution plans. The following is a summary of the Company's defined benefit plans funded status as 44 of the most recent actuarial valuations; for each year presented below accumulated benefits exceed assets: December 31, 2003 2002 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 268,001 $ 232,526 Service cost 5,910 5,116 Interest cost 16,894 16,313 Plan participants' contributions 342 140 Actuarial loss 18,046 23,705 Foreign exchange translation 6,461 5,472 Benefits paid (16,594 ) (15,271 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 299,060 268,001 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 156,079 193,190 Actual return on plan assets 32,535 (25,428 ) Employer contribution 11,619 229 Plan participants' contributions 342 140 Foreign exchange translation 3,111 2,192 Benefits paid (15,477 ) (14,244 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 188,209 156,079 Excess of liabilities over assets (110,851 ) (111,922 ) Unrecognized net actuarial loss 111,070 109,253 Unrecognized prior service cost 7,104 8,694 Unrecognized transition obligation net (1,059 ) (1,163 ) Additional minimum pension liability (103,823 ) (103,830 ) Accrued benefit cost $ (97,559 ) $ (98,968 ) 45 Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Components of net pension expense: Service cost $ 5,910 $ 5,116 $ 4,991 Interest cost 16,894 16,313 15,790 Expected return on plan assets (19,702 ) (22,281 ) (22,014 ) Net amortization of actuarial losses 3,418 1,575 926 Net pension expense (credit) $ 6,520 $ 723 $ (307 ) Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31, Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2003 2002 2003 2002 Discount Rate 6.15 % 6.50 % 6.15 % 6.50 % Rate of compensation increase 3.00 % 3.00 % n/a n/a Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31, Pension Benefits Other Benefits 2003 2002 2003 2002 Discount Rate 6.50 % 7.25 % 6.50 % 7.25 % Expected long-term return on assets 9.50 % 10.50 % n/a n/a Rate of compensation increase 3.00 % 3.00 % n/a n/a The pension expense (credit) for pension plans is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January1 of the applicable year, detailed in the table above, including a weighted-average discount rate, rate of increase in future compensation levels and an expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 6.5% at December31, 2002 to 6.15% at December31, 2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2004 by approximately $.8million. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $11.6million or increased $12.8million, respectively. In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets which consist mainly of U.S. equity and debt securities, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical 14year compound return of 11.4%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is 46 based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. At December31, 2003, our asset allocation was 63% with equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% in 2003 and 2004. The Company has also adopted an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan ("SERP"), which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory limitations on average compensation for purposes of the benefit computation. The largest non-U.S. pension plan, in accordance with local custom, is unfunded and had an accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $34,434 and $25,170 at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Such obligation is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the tables above.
In accordance with the provisions of FAS No.87, the Company has recognized a minimum pension liability at December31, 2003 of $103,823 ($103,830 at December31, 2002) for circumstances in which a pension plan's accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan's assets and accrued pension liability. Such liability was partially offset by an intangible asset equal to the unrecognized prior service cost, with the net change of $103 ($42,452 at December31, 2002), recorded as a reduction in shareholders' equity, net of related deferred tax benefits.
The Company made a $10,000 voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Pension Plan in 2003 and paid benefit payments of $13,900. The Company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the U.S. Pension Plan in 2004 of $10,000. Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including performance of plan assets.
The Company maintains self-insurance programs for that portion of its health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retirees through postretirement benefit programs. The Company's share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees. The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. Since the Company's obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and since the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") and the net postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Company's financial condition or results of operations, we believe any change in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the Company. The discount rate used in determining the APBO at December31, 2003 and 2002 was 6.15% 47 and 6.50%, respectively. Summary information on the Company's postretirement medical plans is as follows: December 31, 2003 2002 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 13,422 $ 13,763 Service cost 73 71 Interest cost 799 912 Paid benefits and expenses (1,733 ) (1,849 ) Actuarial loss 191 525 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 12,752 $ 13,422 Funded status $ (12,752 ) $ (13,422 ) Unrecognized net actuarial loss 9,426 10,092 Unrecognized transition obligation 559 621 Accrued benefit cost $ (2,767 ) $ (2,709 ) Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Components of net postretirement benefit cost: Service cost $ 73 $ 71 $ 75 Interest cost 799 912 972 Amortization of transition obligation 62 62 62 Net amortization of actuarial losses 857 934 975 Net postretirement benefit cost $ 1,791 $ 1,979 $ 2,084 Note6Leases At December31, 2003, the Company was committed under operating leases which expire at various dates through 2010. Total rent expense under operating leases for the years 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $18,650, $16,007 and $16,762, respectively.
Minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 2004 $ 13,424 2005 8,933 2006 6,730 2007 3,406 2008 3,011 Beyond 2008 4,900 Total minimum obligation $ 40,404 48 Note7Reportable Business Segments and International Operations The Company has two reportable business segments: interconnect products and assemblies and cable products. The interconnect products and assemblies segment produces connectors and connector assemblies primarily for the communications, aerospace, industrial and automotive markets. The cable products segment produces coaxial and flat ribbon cable and related products primarily for communication markets, including cable television. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described in Note1 herein. The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest expense, headquarters' expense allocations, income taxes and nonrecurring gains and losses. The Company's operating segments are an aggregation of business units that have similar production processes and products.

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell InternationalInc. in December1999 "Honeywell"), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an Agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.
