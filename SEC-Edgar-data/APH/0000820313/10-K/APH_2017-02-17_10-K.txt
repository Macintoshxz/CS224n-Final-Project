3 Table of Contents Our Strategy The Companys overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:  Pursue broad diversification - The Company constantly drives to increase its diversity of markets, customers, applications and products.Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available.This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance.An overview of the Companys market and product participation is described under Markets.
Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships.The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions.These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect products and have been developed across the Companys markets.The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.
Expand global presence - The Company intends to further expand its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships.As the Companys global customers expand their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs in certain regions, the Company is continuing to expand its international footprint in order to provide just-in-time capabilities to these customers.The majority of the Companys international operations have broad capabilities including new product development.The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia.
Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in todays global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure.Innovation, product quality and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs.Controlling costs is part of a mindset.It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Companys assets as if they were their own.
Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the interconnect and sensor industry is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions.Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high-growth potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence.Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenols business strategy and access to low-cost manufacturing around the world.In 2016, the Company invested approximately $1.3 billion to fund five acquisitions.The acquisition in 2016 of FCI Asia Pte Ltd (FCI), the largest acquisition in our history (FCI acquisition), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, further strengthened our customer base and product offerings in the information technology and data communications, industrial, mobile networks, automotive and mobile devices markets.The other 2016 acquisitions also strengthened our customer base and product offerings in those markets, as well as the broadband market.
Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management - Amphenols management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure.Each general manager is incented to grow and develop his or her business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs.In addition, Amphenols general managers have access 4 Table of Contents to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with other general managers to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals.

We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduces our exposure to particular end markets.Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base is an important strength of the Company.
There has been a trend on the part of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices.The Company has positioned its global resources to compete effectively in this environment.As an industry leader, the Company has established close working relationships with many of its customers on a global basis. These relationships allow the Company to better anticipate and respond to these customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with customers in developing new products and technologies, the Company is able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our portfolio of products.In addition, the Company has concentrated its efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and lower product lead-time and cost.For a discussion of certain risks related to the Companys sales to OEMs, refer to the risk factor titled The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications in PartI,Item 1A herein.
The Companys products are sold to thousands of OEMs in approximately 70 countries throughout the world. The Company also sells certain products to electronic manufacturing services (EMS) companies, to original design manufacturers (ODMs) and to communication network operators.No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Companys net sales for the years ended December31, 2016 and 2014.During the year ended December31, 2015, aggregate sales to Apple Inc., including sales of products to EMS companies and subcontractors that the Company believes are manufacturing products on their behalf, accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales.
The Company sells its products through its own global sales force, independent representatives and a global network of electronics distributors. The Companys sales to distributors represented approximately 14% of the Companys net sales in 2016.In addition to product design teams and customer collaboration arrangements, the Company uses key 7 Table of Contents account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.
Manufacturing The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations and proprietary process technology for specialty and coaxial cable production and sensor fabrication. Outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards, and many of the Companys manufacturing facilities are certified to other quality standards, including QS9000,ISO14000, TS16949 and TS16469.
The Companys manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing.The Company has an established manufacturing presence in approximately 30 countries.Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production and logistics costs. In addition, the Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our balanced geographic distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography.The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.
The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to lower its production and logistics costs and to improve service to customers. The Companys strategy is to maintain strong cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and maximize the return on capital investments.The Company sources its products on a worldwide basis.To better serve certain high-volume customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near these major customers.The Companys international manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the respective local markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Companys other operations around the world.For a discussion of certain risks attendant to the Companys foreign operations, refer to the risk factor titled The Company is subject to the risks of political, economic and military instability in countries outside the United States in PartI,Item 1A herein.

Research and Development The Company generally implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers, which often results in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers new products and programs.The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period.The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue.By developing application specific products, the Company has decreased its exposure to standard products, which generally experience greater pricing pressure.
8 Table of Contents At the end of 2016, our research, development, and engineering efforts were supported by approximately 2,400 employees and were performed primarily by individual operating units focused on specific markets and technologies.The Companys research and development expenses for the creation of new and improved products and processes were $166.1 million, $124.7 million and $114.8 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical, optical, electronic, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon the laws of various jurisdictions and the use of the trademarks.
While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents.
Raw Materials The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including (i) precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products used for cable, contacts and connector shells, (iii) certain rare earth metals used in sensors and (iv) plastic materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts and other molded parts. Such raw materials are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or, if one source is used, the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements.The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining raw materials necessary for production.Information regarding our purchasing obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For a discussion of certain risks related to raw materials, refer to the risk factor titled The Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels in PartI,Item 1A herein.
Competition The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time.Primary competitors within the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment include TE Connectivity, Molex, Yazaki, Foxconn, Sensata, JST, Delphi, Hirose and JAE, among others.Primary competitors within the Cable Products and Solutions segment include Commscope and Belden, among others.In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products.For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business in PartI,Item 1A herein.
Backlog The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December31, 2016 was approximately $1.319 billioncompared with backlog of approximately $1.121 billion as of December31, 2015.Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12months. Significant elements of the Companys business, such as sales to the communications-related markets 9 Table of Contents (including wireless communications, information technology and data communications and broadband communications) and sales to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.
Employees As of December31, 2016, the Company had approximately 62,000 employees worldwide.The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.Refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. herein for a discussion of certain risks related to employee relations.
Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Available Information The Companys annual report on Form10-K and all of the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, are available to view, free of charge, on the Companys website, www.amphenol.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with, or furnished to, the SEC. Copies are also available without charge, from Amphenol Corporation,Investor Relations, 358 Hall Avenue, Wallingford, CT 06492.
Item 1A. Risk Factors Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this annual report on Form10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the Companys business, operations, liquidity and financial condition.
If actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control financial enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Companys business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Companys common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.
Approximately 50% of the Companys 2016 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 14% of the Companys 2016 net sales coming from sales to the mobile device market. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change (see belowThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth). These markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company.Furthermore, there has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices.There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry.The Companys failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
Approximately 6% and 9% of the Companys 2016 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively.Demand for the Companys products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Companys sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their 10 Table of Contents access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.
Changes in defense expenditures may reduce the Companys sales.
Approximately 9% of the Companys 2016 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The substantial majority of these sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. The Companys military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Companys sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.
The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the Companys existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth.
The Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 20% of 2016 net sales. The Companys long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line concepts. If the Company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the Companys new products are not met with market acceptance, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
The Companys credit agreements contain certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2016, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and a syndicate of financial institutions (the Revolving Credit Facility), which also backstops the Companys commercial paper program, contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Companys operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Companys control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Companys credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, the Company may not have sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness.As of December31, 2016, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the commercial paper program of nil and $1,018.9 million, respectively.
The Company relies on the capital markets, and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Companys results.
The Company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions.If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Companys ability to access the capital markets.While the Company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past.Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases.As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or 11 Table of Contents cash flows.In addition, while the Company has not encountered any such issues to date, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Companys debt were to downgrade the Companys credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the Companys performance, it would likely increase the Companys cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
The Companys results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates .
The Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors the mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as the mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December31, 2016, $1,024.4 million, or 34%, of the Companys outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates.
As of December31, 2016, the Company had the following unsecured Senior Notes outstanding: Principal Fixed Amount Interest (inmillions) Rate Maturity $ 375.0 1.55 % September2017 750.0 2.55 % January2019 375.0 3.125 % September2021 500.0 4.00 % February2022 A 10% change in LIBOR or floating interest rates at December31, 2016 would not have a material effect on the Companys interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2017, although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly.
The Companys results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management.However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
12 Table of Contents The Company is subject to the risks of political, economic and military instability in countries outside the United States.
Non-U.S. markets account for a substantial portion of the Companys business.During 2016, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 72% of the Companys net sales, with China constituting approximately 30% of the Companys net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Companys customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States.Because the Company has extensive non-U.S. operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the U.S., it is exposed to risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, including:  tariffs, trade barriers, trade disputes, trade sanctions, trade agreements or any other changes in trade policies or trade agreements;  regulations related to customs and import/export matters;  longer payment cycles;  tax issues, such as tax law changes, audits and examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country as compared to the U.S. and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;  credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;  employment regulations and local labor conditions;  difficulties protecting intellectual property;  instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, foreign currency exchange restrictions and devaluations, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, particularly in emerging markets; and  the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements.
The Company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill.
The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisition of FCI on January8, 2016.The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy.The Company may experience difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with integrating such acquisitions, and the acquisitions may not perform as expected.At December31, 2016, the total assets of the Company were $8,498.7 million,which included $3,678.8 million of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired).The Company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill.Such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Companys businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill.
The Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels.
The Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare earth metals and plastic resins, in its manufacturing processes. Volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such materials. In addition, to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements, the Companys margins may decline.
Our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.
Several anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies from engaging in improper conduct for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or improving business.Such acts may include, but are not limited to, bribery, conflicts of interest, fraud, kickbacks and money laundering.While the Companys internal controls and systems are designed to protect it from illegal acts committed by employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners that may violate U.S. or local jurisdictional laws, there are no guarantees that such internal controls and systems will always protect the Company from such acts.Such violations or allegations could damage the Companys reputation, lead to criminal or civil investigations in the U.S. or foreign 13 Table of Contents jurisdictions, and ultimately result in monetary or non-monetary penalties and/or significant legal and administrative fees.Any significant violations of our standards of conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company may be subject to litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.
The Company may be subject to litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings that could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, including but not limited to, claims related to employment, tax, intellectual property, environmental, sales practices, workers compensation, product warranty, product liability and acquisitions.These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in significant legal expenses.While the Company does maintain insurance coverage to mitigate losses associated with some of these types of proceedings, the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities.
Cybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially lead to litigation.
Global cybersecurity threats to the Company could lead to unauthorized access to the Companys information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third party service providers.Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and the misappropriation, destruction, or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary technological information.Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third party service providers.Despite the Companys implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from a cybersecurity incident, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures, natural disasters or catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage and litigation with third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, and other factors beyond the Companys control may adversely impact our business and operating results.
The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions.The following factors could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows:  a global economic slowdown in any of the Companys market segments;  uncertainty about global, regional and U.S. economic or geopolitical conditions that result in postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;  the effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures;  rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation;  changes in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers;  intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars and acts of terrorism or war;  interruptions to the Companys business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions, inventory excesses, natural disasters or other disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or explosions;  increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates; and  changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Companys benefit plans.

14 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties The Companys fixed assets include plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Companys plants, warehouses and machinery and equipment are generally in good operating condition, are reasonably maintained and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. At December31, 2016, the Company operated a total of approximately 390 plants, warehouses and offices of which (a)the locations in the U.S. had approximately 3.5 million square feet, of which approximately 1.7 million square feet were leased; (b)the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 15.0million square feet, of which approximately 10.0 million square feet were leased; and (c)the square footage by segment was approximately 17.6 million square feet and approximately 0.9 million square feet for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment and the Cable Products and Solutions segment, respectively.
The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising from normal business activities.Although the potential liability with respect to such legal actions cannot be reasonably estimated, such matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Refer to Risk Factors in PartI,Item 1A herein for additional information regarding legal risks and uncertainties.

Overview General The Company is one of the worlds largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable.The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i)Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii)Cable Products and Solutions.In 2016, approximately 72% of the Companys sales were outside the U.S.The primary end markets for our products are:  information technology and communication devices and systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data communications;  a broad range of industrial applications and traditional and hybrid-electric automotive applications; and  commercial aerospace and military applications.
The Companys products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers.The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time.There has been a trend on the part of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices.The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment.The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.
Strategy The Companys strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.The Company focuses its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period.The Company is also focused on controlling costs.The Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing processes and expanding into lower cost areas.
19 Table of Contents The Companys strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:  Pursue broad diversification;  Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions;  Expand global presence;  Control costs;  Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments; and  Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management.

(2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the prior year.Such amount is calculated by translating current year net sales at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year.
(3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section.
(4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed during the years presented, which were not included in the Companys results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
Geographically, net sales in the U.S. in 2016 increased approximately 3% ($1,740.7 in 2016 versus $1,696.3 in 2015) compared to 2015.International sales in 2016 increased approximately 17% in U.S. dollars ($4,545.7 in 2016 versus $3,872.4 in 2015), 19% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to 2015 with strength in both Asia and Europe.The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $61.3when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2015.
Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.5% in 2016 compared to 31.9% in 2015.The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction actions as well as the impact of the FCI acquisition, which had higher gross margins than the average of the Company.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $798.2 or 12.7% of net sales for 2016, compared to $669.1 or 12.0% of net sales for 2015.The increase is driven primarily by the impact of the FCI acquisition, which has higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than the average of the Company.Administrative expenses increased approximately $41.2 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and increases in the amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales in 2016 and 4.8% of net sales in 2015.Research and development expenses increased approximately $41.4 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and represented approximately 2.6% of net sales in 2016 and 2.2% of net sales in 2015. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $46.5 in 2016 primarily related to the impact of the FCI acquisition and an increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales in 2016 and 5.0% of net sales in 2015.
Operating income was $1,205.2 or 19.2% of net sales in 2016, compared to $1,104.7 or 19.8% of net sales in 2015.Operating income for 2016 includes $36.6 of acquisition-related expenses, which included external transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges related to the FCI acquisition, as well as transaction costs associated with other acquisitions. Operating income for 2015 includes $5.7 21 Table of Contents of acquisition-related expenses, which included professional and transaction-related fees and other external expenses related to acquisitions closed and announced in 2015.
These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income.For the years ended December31, 2016 and 2015, these expenses had an impact on net income of $33.1, or $0.11 per share, and $5.7, or $0.02 per share, respectively.Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below, were $1,241.8 or 19.8% of net sales in 2016 and $1,110.4 or 19.9% in 2015. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2016 compared to 2015, relates to the decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2016 was $1,280.3 or 21.6% of net sales, compared to $1,158.3 or 22.1% of net sales in 2015. The slight decrease in operating income margin is driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition, which had a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the full year period.In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2016 was $52.8 or 14.5% of net sales, compared to $40.3 or 12.2% of net sales in 2015.The increase in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily as a result of strong operating execution on additional volume, along with the benefit from the favorable impact from commodities.
The table below reconciles Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Operating Operating Operating Operating income margin income margin Reported (GAAP) $ 1,205.2 19.2 % $ 1,104.7 19.8 % Acquisition-related expenses 36.6 0.6 % 5.7 0.1 % Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,241.8 19.8 % $ 1,110.4 19.9 % Interest expense was $72.6 in 2016 compared to $68.3 in 2015.The increase is primarily attributable to the impact of higher average debt levels in 2016 which primarily resulted from the Companys dividend and stock buyback programs.
Other income, net, decreased to $8.5 in 2016 compared to $16.4 in 2015, primarily related to lower interest income on lower cash equivalents and short-term investments, which resulted from the funding of the acquisition of FCI in January 2016 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside of the United States.
The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 27.0% in 2016 and 26.6% in 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 included the effect of acquisition-related expenses incurred during each year, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 50 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Companys effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2015 Compared to 2014 Net sales were $5,568.7 for the year ended December31, 2015 compared to $5,345.5 for the year ended December31, 2014, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 94% of net sales) increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 3% organically in 2015, compared to 2014. The sales growth was driven by increases in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and information technology and data communications equipment markets, with contributions from both organic growth and the Companys acquisition program; partially offset by decreases in sales in the mobile networks, commercial aerospace and military markets. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $190.9), driven both by acquisitions and an expansion of our products across a diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $116.5) primarily due to growth in next generation laptops, mobile device accessories and production-related products. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $43.0) reflecting the benefit of acquisitions as well as growth in industrial battery and hybrid vehicle applications and in alternative energy applications, offset by significant declines in products sold into oil and gas exploration. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $17.6), primarily due to the growth in products for server, web and data center applications, partially offset by declines in storage-related 22 Table of Contents applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $101.7), primarily due to a decrease in worldwide mobile network build-outs. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased (approximately $21.5), primarily due to decreases in commercial helicopter and business jet demand. Net sales to the military market decreased slightly (approximately $3.8). Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 6% of net sales), which is primarily in the broadband communications market, decreased 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in both constant currencies and organically in 2015, compared to 2014 primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators and the effect of ongoing operator consolidations in the broadband market.

Geographically, net sales in the U.S. in 2015 increased approximately 1% ($1,696.3 in 2015 versus $1,673.5 in 2014) compared to 2014. International sales for 2015 increased approximately 5% in U.S. dollars and approximately 10% in constant currencies ($3,872.4 in 2015 versus $3,672.0 in 2014) compared to 2014 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $190.3when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2014.
Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.9% in 2015 compared to 31.7% in 2014.The increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales relates primarily to higher gross profit margins in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction actions.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $669.1 or 12.0% of net sales for 2015, compared to $645.1 or 12.1% of net sales for 2014. Administrative expenses increased approximately $9.6 in 2015 primarily related to increases in the amortization of acquisition-related identified intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense and represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in both 2015 and 2014. Research and development expenses increased approximately $9.9 in 2015 reflecting an overall increase in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.2% of net sales in 2015 and 2.1% of net sales in 2014. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $4.5 in 2015 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 5.0% of net sales in 2015 and 5.1% of net sales in 2014.
Operating income was $1,104.7 or 19.8% of net sales in 2015, compared to $1,034.6 or 19.4% of net sales in 2014. Operating income for 2015 includes $5.7 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income) related to professional fees and other external expenses for acquisitions that were closed and announced in 2015. Operating income for 2014 includes $14.1 of acquisition-related expenses, which included professional and transaction-related fees and other external expenses related to acquisitions closed in 2014, as well as the amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog related to acquisitions that closed in 2013 and 2014. For the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014, these expenses had an impact on net income of $5.7, or $0.02 per share, and $10.2, or $0.04 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below, were $1,110.4 or 19.9% of net sales in 2015 and $1,048.7 or 19.6% of net sales in 2014. The increase in Adjusted Operating 23 Table of Contents Margin in 2015 compared to 2014 relates to the increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2015 was $1,158.3 or 22.1% of net sales, compared to $1,088.0 or 21.8% of net sales in 2014. This increase in operating income margin is driven primarily by the positive impact of higher gross profit margins as well as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, as described above. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for 2015 was $40.3 or 12.2% of net sales, compared to $43.7 or 12.4% of net sales for 2014. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily as a result of lower volumes.
The table below reconciles Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Operating Operating Operating Operating income margin income margin Reported (GAAP) $ 1,104.7 19.8 % $ 1,034.6 19.4 % Acquisition-related expenses 5.7 0.1 % 14.1 0.2 % Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 1,110.4 19.9 % $ 1,048.7 19.6 % Interest expense was $68.3 for 2015 compared to $80.4 for 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to the benefit of lower average borrowing rates resulting from the commercial paper program that was initiated in late 2014, and a senior note issuance in the third quarter of 2014 which replaced a higher rate note maturity.This benefit more than offset the impact of higher average debt levels which resulted from the Companys stock buyback program as well as acquisition activity.
Other income, net, decreased to $16.4 in 2015 compared to $18.3 in 2014, primarily related to lower interest income on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 26.6% in 2015 and 26.5% in 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 included the effect of acquisition-related expenses incurred during each year, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 10 basis points.Acquisition-related expenses incurred during 2014 did not have an impact on the effective tax rate for that year.For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Companys effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources At December31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,173.2 and $1,760.4, respectively.On January 8, 2016, the Company used approximately $1,178.6 of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, net of cash acquired, to fund the FCI acquisition.The vast majority of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2016 was located outside of the U.S.The Company does not currently intend to repatriate any of its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, but rather to permanently reinvest such funds outside the U.S.However, any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes.
Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes the Companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,077.6 $ 1,030.5 $ 880.9 Net cash used in investing activities (1,612.7) (27.3) (781.9) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (133.5) (180.1) 14.1 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34.0) (54.8) (31.0) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (702.6) $ 768.3 $ 82.1 24 Table of Contents Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities has been one of the Companys fundamental financial strengths.Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,077.6 for 2016 compared to $1,030.5 for 2015. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to an increase in net income, higher non-cash charges resulting from the increase in depreciation and amortization related to the FCI acquisition, and a higher decrease in the net components of working capital, which were partially offset by a higher usage of cash related to the change in long-term assets and liabilities.Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,030.5 for 2015 compared to $880.9 for 2014. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in net income and an overall decrease in the net components of working capital, compared to the increase in net working capital in 2014.
In 2016, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $51.2, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes, other accrued liabilities, and accounts payable of $91.7, $61.9, and $47.8, respectively, and a decrease in other current assets of $29.9, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of $165.9 and $14.2, respectively.In 2015, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow decreased $46.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to decreases in other current assets of $47.7 and increases in accrued liabilities of $44.2, offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $22.3 and $5.2, respectively, and decreases in accounts payable of $17.5.In 2014, the components of working capital increased $18.9, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets of $111.5, $51.6 and $10.0, respectively, offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $66.8 and $87.3, respectively.
The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Accounts receivable increased $244.7 to $1,349.3 primarily due to the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions as well as an increase in sales volume, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December31, 2016 compared to December31, 2015 (Translation). Days sales outstanding at December31, 2016 and 2015 were 73 and 71, respectively.Inventories increased $77.1 to $928.9, primarily due to the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December31, 2016 and 2015 were 76 and 79, respectively. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $101.9 to $711.4, primarily due to the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, as well as capital expenditures of $190.8, partially offset by depreciation of $157.8, disposals and Translation.Goodwill increased $985.9 to $3,678.8 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized during the year related to four acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment, including FCI, and one acquisition in the Cable Products and Solutions segment, partially offset by Translation.Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $211.3 to $517.3 primarily as a result of the identifiable intangible assets of $263.0 recognized related to the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of $54.6 and Translation.Accounts payable increased $90.4 to $678.2, primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by Translation.Payable days at December31, 2016 and 2015 were 55 and 54, respectively.Total accrued expenses increased $161.5 to $581.8, primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions.Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations increased $25.9 to $288.4 primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI acquisition.Other long-term liabilities increased $120.6 to $216.5 primarily as a result of the impact of the FCI and other 2016 acquisitions, specifically related to an increase in contingent tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities.
In 2016, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $26.2, the majority of which was to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the plan assets.
Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures (purchases of land and depreciable assets), proceeds from disposals of land and depreciable assets, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.

Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Companys credit facilities and other long-debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits, dividend payments and distributions to noncontrolling interests.
Net cash used in financing activities was $133.5 in 2016, compared to $180.1 in 2015.In 2016, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Companys common stock of $325.8, dividend payments of $172.7, payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.8 and payments of costs related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility of $3.0, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $191.6 and increased net borrowings of $183.2. In 2015, cash used in financing activities of $180.1 was driven primarily by repurchases of the Companys common stock of $248.9, dividend payments of $159.3 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $6.1, partially offset by increased net borrowings of $153.6 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $80.6. In 2014, cash provided by financing activities of $14.1 was driven primarily by increased net borrowings of $540.0 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options including the related excess tax benefits of $130.1, partially offset by repurchases of the Companys common stock of $539.4, dividend payments of $101.9, payments of costs related to debt financing of $11.1 and payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.6.
The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments.The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders equity.The Company has been, and continues to be, able to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates.The Companys debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper program, the revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
On March1, 2016, the Company replaced its $1,500.0 unsecured credit facility with a new $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures March2021, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.The Company intends to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.At December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.At December31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
In September2014, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (Commercial Paper Program) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements.Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The Commercial Paper Program is rated A-2 by Standard& Poors and P-2 by Moodys and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility.Effective April 1, 2016, the maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper Program was increased by $500.0 from $1,500.0 to $2,000.0.The amount of commercial paper notes outstanding as of December31, 2016 was $1,018.9.Additionally, in 2014, the Company issued three separate unsecured senior notes with an aggregate $1,500.0 principal amount, the proceeds of which were used to repay the $600.0 4.75% notes which matured during the year and borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facilities.Fees and expenses related to the issuance of the Revolving Credit Facility in 2016 was $3.0.The fees and expenses related to the issuance of the commercial paper and senior notes in 2014 was $11.1.Such issuance fees and expenses are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the debt.The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.
26 Table of Contents As of December31, 2016, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the Senior Notes) as follows: Principal Interest Amount Rate Maturity $ 375.0 1.55 % September2017 750.0 2.55 % January2019 375.0 3.125 % September2021 500.0 4.00 % February2022 The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to the date of maturity, a make-whole premium. The 1.55% Senior Notes are due in September2017 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016.
Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Companys debt.
In January2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its Common Stock during the two-year period ending January31, 2015 (the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program).During the year ended December31, 2014, the Company repurchased 11.4 million shares of its common stock for $539.4.These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly.At December31, 2014, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program.
In January2015, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 10 million shares of its Common Stock during the two-year period ended January20, 2017 (the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program).During the years ended December31, 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased 5.5 million and 4.5 million shares of its common stock for $325.8 and $248.9, respectively.These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly.At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program.
On January24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Companys Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program).As of February 10, 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock for $213.9 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of Common Stock.In the third quarter of2015, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.125 to $0.14 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2015, and in October 2016, approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.14 to $0.16 per share effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2016.Total dividends declared during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $178.8, $163.7 and $140.6, respectively. Total dividends paid in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $172.7, $159.3 and $101.9, respectively, including those declared in the prior year and paid in the current year. The Companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Commercial Paper Program.
Liquidity and Cash Requirements The Companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand.The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from 27 Table of Contents operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months, including the repayment of its 1.55% Senior Notes due in September 2017.
The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends and debt service.The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions, as it did with the 2016 acquisition of FCI.The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of approximately $200.0 to $240.0.
FCI Acquisition On January8, 2016, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated July17, 2015 and as amended on December31, 2015, the Company acquired all of the share capital of FCI for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,178.6, net of cash acquired, which was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand that were held outside of the United States.
Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the FCI acquisition.
Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Inflation and Costs The cost of the Companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials.The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs.However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful.
Foreign Exchange The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management.However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations.For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled The Companys results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates in PartI,Item 1A herein.
Non-GAAP FinancialMeasures In addition to assessing the Companys financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Companys financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures.Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Companys overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below.Non-GAAP financial measures exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented.Items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, certain discrete tax items and refinancing-related costs 28 Table of Contents that may arise during such periods.The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures.In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items.
The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Companys financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are included in Results of Operations:  Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note1 of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Pensions The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (U.S. Plans), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company.The U.S. Plans benefits are generally based on years of service and 29 Table of Contents compensation and are generally noncontributory.Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans.Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the International Plans).The pension expense for the U.S. Plans and the International Plans (together, the Plans) approximated $24.2, $31.0 and $22.4 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January1 of the applicable year, including a weighted average discount rate, mortality projections, rate of increase of future compensation levels, and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans assets.
The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations.The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 3.93% and 4.11% at December31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. Plans resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $10.7 at December31, 2016. The weighted average discount rate for the International Plans was 2.28% and 3.14% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The decrease in the discount rate for the International Plans did not have a material impact on the benefit obligation at December 31, 2016. At December31, 2015, the Company elected to further refine its approach for calculating its service and interest costs beginning in 2016 by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the Company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations.The mortality assumptions used by the Company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants.
In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as consideration of long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices.The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 8.5%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 6.0%).The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Companys expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the U.S. Plans for the years ended December31, 2016 and 2015 was 7.75% and 8.00%, respectively. The Company's expected weighted average long-term rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit costof the International Plans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 4.29% and 5.47%, respectively.
The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $26.2, $24.1 and $23.8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2016 to $290.9 ($4.0 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2017 for unfunded foreign plans) from $266.0 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make aggregate cash contributions to the Plans in 2017 of approximately $25.0, the majority of which will be to the U.S. Plans.The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the Plans assets.
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements.The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation.The Company provided matching contributions to its U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $5.0, $4.2 and $3.8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
30 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available.The Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note1 of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition - The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers.Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered, title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable.Such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board shipping point.Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns.These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors.The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers.In the broadband communications market (approximately 6% of net sales in 2016), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers. Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales.Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would be increased accordingly.
Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions.The Company has not recorded any significant impairments.
Goodwill - The Company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys two reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting units carrying amount may be impaired. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products and Solutions, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics.In 2015, the Company changed its annual assessment date for goodwill impairment to be as of July1, rather than June30, which had no impact on the outcome of the assessment.
In 2016, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment.As part of this assessment, the Company reviews qualitative factors, which include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit.In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting units carrying value is less than its fair value.As of July 1, 2016, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts.
In 2015, the Company exercised its option to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reportable business segment.As part of the quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of each of its reportable business segments using a market approach.The Company believed this approach provided the best indicator of fair value, by utilizing market prices and other relevant metrics for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics and recent transactions of similar businesses within the industry.Significant estimates and assumptions were used in the Companys goodwill impairment assessment including revenue and profitability projections, determination of appropriate publicly traded market comparison companies, and comparable revenue and earnings multiples derived from 31 Table of Contents comparable publicly traded companies and from recent acquisitions within our industry. As part of our quantitative approach, the Company evaluated whether it was reasonably likely that changes to managements estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment.As of July1, 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the Companys reportable business segments was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts, and therefore, no goodwill impairment resulted from the assessment.
The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2016, 2015 or 2014 in connection with its annual impairment assessment.
Acquisitions - The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified.The Company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates.
Defined Benefit Plan Obligation - The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors.Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December31, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $4,182.5. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Companys intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
32 Table of Contents Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Companys known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December31, 2016, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied.
PaymentDueByPeriod ContractualObligations Lessthan 1-3 3-5 Morethan (dollarsinmillions) Total 1year years years 5years Debt (1) $ 3,023.0 $ 375.7 $ 750.1 $ 1,396.9 $ 500.3 Interest related to senior notes 224.3 56.7 84.2 63.4 20.0 Operating leases 129.2 42.4 53.9 20.5 12.4 Purchase obligations (2) 255.5 219.9 35.0 0.6  Accrued pension and postretirement benefitobligations (3) 59.7 7.9 12.0 12.2 27.6 Total (4) $ 3,691.7 $ 702.6 $ 935.2 $ 1,493.6 $ 560.3 (1) The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Companys Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, combined, in 2016 were $10.1.Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.
(2) Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including raw materials and components to be used in production.
(3) Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Companys underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans, the most significant of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2017.However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $15.0 in 2016 and anticipates making a similar voluntary contribution in 2017.It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2017 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.
(4) As of December31, 2016, the Company has recorded liabilities of approximately $138.7 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid .
33 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Companys sales, gross margins and equity. The Company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, and working capital management.However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the Companys worldwide operations.
As of December31, 2016, the Company had four forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed Euro, Great Britain Pound and Korean Won intercompany debt obligations into fixed Hong Kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2017 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans.The fair value of the contracts at December31, 2016 resulted in a net asset of $8.4. A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of December31, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the Companys financing activities.The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.In 2014, the Company issued $750.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.55% senior notes due January2019, $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 1.55% senior notes due September2017 and $375.0 principal amount of unsecured 3.125% senior notes due September2021.The Company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding $600.0 million 4.75% senior notes that were due in November2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility and credit facilities.
Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR and any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are subject to floating interest rates.Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates.As of December31, 2016, $1,024.4, or 34%, of the Companys outstanding borrowings related mainly to its Commercial Paper Program, were subject to floating interest rates.At December31, 2016, the Companys average floating rate on such borrowings was 1.06%.A 10% change in this interest rate at December31, 2016 and 2015 would not have a material effect on interest expense.The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2017, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

40 Table of Contents AMPHENOL CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements All dollar amounts included in the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted.
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Amphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, Amphenol or the Company) is one of the worlds largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable.The Company sells its products to customer locations worldwide.
The Company operates through two reportable business segments:  Interconnect Products and Assemblies The Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment primarily designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a broad range of applications in a diverse set of end markets.
Cable Products and Solutions The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designs, manufactures and markets cable, value-added products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets as well as certain applications in other markets.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.The Companys management evaluates these significant estimates and assumptions including those related to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, stock-based compensation, pension obligations, derivative instruments, income taxes, inventories, goodwill, intangibles and other matters that affect the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Actual results could differ from those estimates. All normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been included.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The results of companies acquired are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The carrying amounts approximate fair values of those instruments, the majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts.
Short-term Investments Short-term investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit with original maturities of twelve months or less.The carrying amounts approximate fair values of those instruments, the majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts.
41 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is stated at net realizable value.The Company regularly reviews accounts receivable balances and adjusts the receivable reserves as necessary whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. The principal components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates the realizability of inventories and adjusts the carrying value as necessary based on forecasted product demand.
Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite basis by asset group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful lives of such assets, which range from 3 to 12years for machinery and equipment and 20 to 40years for buildings. Leasehold building improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life. The Company periodically reviews fixed asset lives.Depreciation expense is included in both Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the specific categorization and use of the underlying asset being depreciated. The Company assesses the impairment of property and equipment subject to depreciation, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of the use of the asset, significant changes in historical trends in operating performance, significant changes in projected operating performance, and significant negative economic trends. There have been no significant impairments recorded as a result of such reviews during any of the periods presented.
Goodwill The Company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Companys two reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting units carrying amount may be impaired.The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments Interconnect Products and Assemblies and Cable Products and Solutions, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics.In 2015, the Company changed its annual assessment date for goodwill impairment to be as of July 1, rather than June 30, which had no impact on the outcome of the assessment.
In 2016, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment.As part of this assessment, the Company reviews qualitative factors, which include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit.In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting units carrying value is less than its fair value.As of July 1, 2016, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts.
In 2015, the Company exercised its option to bypass the qualitative assessment, and in the third quarter of 2015, the Company performed the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reportable business segment.As part of the quantitative assessment, the Company estimated the fair value of each of its reportable business segments using a market approach.The Company believes this approach provides the best indicator of fair value, by utilizing market prices and other relevant metrics for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics and recent transactions of similar businesses within the industry.Significant estimates and assumptions were used in the Companys goodwill impairment assessment including revenue and profitability projections, determination of appropriate publicly traded market comparison companies, and comparable revenue and earnings multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies and from recent acquisitions within our industry.As part of our quantitative approach, the Company evaluated whether it was reasonably likely that changes to managements estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment 42 Table of Contents assessment.As of July 1, 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the Companys reportable business segments was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts, and therefore, no goodwill impairment resulted from the assessment.
The Company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2016, 2015 or 2014 in connection with its annual impairment assessment.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets and consist primarily of proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements and are generally amortized over the estimated periods of benefit. The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, other than goodwill, including identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever significant events or significant changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.Factors the Company considers important, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant changes in the manner of the use of the asset, changes in historical trends in operating performance, significant changes in projected operating performance, anticipated future cash flows and significant negative economic trends. Indefinite-lived intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are reviewed at least annually for impairment.There have been no impairments recorded in 2016, 2015 or 2014 as a result of such reviews.
Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers. Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered, title passes, and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable.Such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.Delivery is determined by the Companys shipping terms, which are primarily freight on board (FOB) shipping point. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and related reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors.
The shipping costs for the majority of the Companys sales are paid directly by the Companys customers.In the broadband communications market (approximately 6% of net sales in 2016), the Company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers.Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in Net sales.Shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
Retirement Pension Plans Costs for retirement pension plans include current service costs and amortization of prior service costs over the average working life expectancy. It is the Companys policy to fund current pension costs taking into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized during the employees service with the Company.The recognition of expense for retirement pension plans and medical benefit programs is significantly impacted by estimates made by management such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on assets, mortality projections and future health care costs.The Company uses third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense and obligations associated with pension and other postretirement plan benefits.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock option and restricted share awards based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense over the service period that the awards are expected to vest.The Company recognizes expense for stock-based compensation with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award.Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods.
43 Table of Contents The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 2016 2015 2014 Risk free interest rate 1.3 % 1.4 % 1.6 % Expected life 4.6 years 4.6 years 4.6 years Expected volatility 15.0 % 17.0 % 21.0 % Expected dividend yield 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.0 % Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately $4,182.5.Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the Companys intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits, which could ultimately reduce the U.S. tax cost of the dividend. These uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
Foreign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of the Companys significant foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and related revenues and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments is included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity.
Transaction gains and losses related to operating assets and liabilities are included in Cost of sales.
Research and Development Costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and applications are expensed as incurred.Research and development expenses for the creation of new and improved products and processes were $166.1, $124.7 and $114.8, for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
Acquisitions The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date.The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.Any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified.The Company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates.
44 Table of Contents Environmental Obligations The Company recognizes the potential cost for environmental remediation activities when site assessments are made, remediation efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential insurance reimbursements are not recorded. The Company assesses its environmental liabilities as necessary and appropriate through regular reviews of contractual commitments, site assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.
Net Income per Common Share Basic income per common share is based on the net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation for the year divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per common share assumes the exercise of outstanding dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments, which are periodically used by the Company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures, are accounted for as cash flow hedges.Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reflected in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income in a manner that matches the timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with the hedged transaction. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of designated hedging instruments is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s); (3) determine the transaction price(s); (4) allocate the transaction price(s) to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also requires advanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):Deferral of the Effective Date (ASU 2015-14), which defers the effective date of FASBs revenue standard under ASU 2014-09 by one year for all entities and permits early adoption on a limited basis.As a result of ASU 2015-14, the guidance under ASU 2014-09 shall apply for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods.In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) , which clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , which clarified the implementation guidance regarding performance obligations and licensing arrangements.As permitted under the standard, the Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and recognize the cumulative effect to existing contracts in opening retained earnings on the effective date.The Company is currently reviewing and evaluating this guidance and its impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In May2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (Issue 14-B) (ASU 2015-07), which removes the requirement that investments measured using the practical expedient to measure fair value at net asset value be included in the fair value hierarchy. Rather, an entity shall provide a reconciliation between the total fair value of investments included in the fair value hierarchy and such amounts presented on the balance sheet, including disclosures for such investments of which the net asset value practical expedient has been elected and used to determine fair value. ASU 2015-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.The 45 Table of Contents Company adopted ASU 2015-07, and as a result, the Companys impacted investments within its pension plan assets have been removed, retrospectively, from the fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The adoption of ASU 2015-07 did not have any impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11), which requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance of measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market.ASU 2015-11 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.The Company has evaluated ASU 2015-11 and it will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which amends, among other things, the existing guidance by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets (right-to-use) and liabilities (for reasonably certain lease payments) arising from operating leases on the balance sheet.For leases with a term of twelve months or less, ASU 2016-02 permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to recognize such leases as lease expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-02 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 , Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which simplifies certain provisions associated with the accounting for stock compensation.Among other things, ASU 2016-09 requires companies to record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of income and eliminates the requirement to reclassify cash flows related to excess tax benefits from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows.ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 and the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the timing and intrinsic value of future stock-based compensation award exercises.
In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which amends ASC 230 to add and clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.ASU 2016-15 was issued with the intent of reducing diversity in practice with respect to certain types of cash flows.ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.The Company has evaluated ASU 2016-15 and does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Credit Facility On March 1, 2016, the Company replaced its $1,500.0 unsecured credit facility with a new $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility).The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures March 2021, increases the aggregate commitments by $500.0 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. The carrying value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility approximated their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 3). At December31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.
Commercial Paper In September 2014, the Company entered into a commercial paper program (the Program) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper) in one or more private placements. Amounts available under the Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.The maturities of the Commercial Paper vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.The Commercial Paper is sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, may be sold at par, and bears varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.The Program is rated A-2 by Standard & Poors and P-2 by Moodys and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility.Effective April 1, 2016, the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Commercial Paper outstanding under the Program at any time was increased by $500.0 from $1,500.0 to $2,000.0.The Commercial Paper is classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets since the Company has the intent and ability to refinance the Commercial Paper on a long-term basis using the Revolving Credit Facility.The carrying value of Commercial Paper borrowings approximated their fair value given that the Commercial Paper is actively traded.As such, the Commercial Paper is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 3).The average interest rate on the Commercial Paper as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 1.06% and 0.88%, respectively.
47 Table of Contents Senior Notes The senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to the date of maturity, a make-whole premium.The 1.55% Senior Notes are due in September2017 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016.
The maturity of the Companys debt (exclusive of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2016) over each of the next five years ending December31 and thereafter, is as follows: 2017 $ 375.7 2018 0.3 2019 749.8 2020 0.1 2021 1,396.8 Thereafter 500.3 $ 3,023.0 The Company has a $20.0 uncommitted standby letter of credit facility of which approximately $12.7 was issued at December 31, 2016.
Note 3Fair Value Measurements Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
The valuation techniques required are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
48 Table of Contents The Company believes that the assets or liabilities subject to such standards with fair value disclosure requirements are short-term investments and derivative instruments.Substantially all of the Companys short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of twelve months or less and as such, are considered as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as they are traded in active markets which have identical assets.The carrying amounts of these instruments, the majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts, approximate their fair value.The Companys derivative instruments represent foreign exchange rate forward contracts, which are valued using bank quotations based on market observable inputs such as forward and spot rates and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The impact of the credit risk related to these financial assets is immaterial.The fair values of the Companys financial and non-financial assets and liabilities subject to such standards at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: FairValueMeasurements QuotedPricesin Significant Significant ActiveMarkets Observable Unobservable forIdentical Inputs Inputs 2016 Total Assets(Level1) (Level2) (Level3) Short-term investments $ 138.6 $ 138.6 $  $  Forward contracts 8.4  8.4  Total $ 147.0 $ 138.6 $ 8.4 $  2015 Short-term investments $ 23.2 $ 23.2 $  $  Forward contracts 3.3  3.3  Total $ 26.5 $ 23.2 $ 3.3 $  The Company does not have any significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, a gain (loss) of $1.6 and $(0.4), respectively, was recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with foreign exchange rate forward contracts. The amount reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to foreign exchange gain (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income during 2016 and 2015 was not material. The fair values of the forward contracts are recorded within Other current assets, Intangibles, net and other long-term assets, Other accrued expenses or Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on their value and remaining contractual period.
Note 4Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes and the provision for income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December31, 2016 2015 2014 Income before income taxes: United States $ 87.7 $ 134.4 $ 161.4 Foreign 1,053.4 918.4 811.1 $ 1,141.1 $ 1,052.8 $ 972.5 Current tax provision: United States $ 74.6 $ 39.5 $ 63.7 Foreign 263.8 228.1 183.1 338.4 267.6 246.8 Deferred tax provision (benefit): United States (32.3) 13.3 (0.7) Foreign 2.4 (0.4) 11.2 (29.9) 12.9 10.5 Total provision for income taxes $ 308.5 $ 280.5 $ 257.3 At December 31, 2016, the Company had $126.4 of foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, $17.4 of U.S. federal loss and credit carryforwards, and $7.9 of U.S. state tax loss and credit carryforwards net of federal benefit, of which 49 Table of Contents $69.4, $17.4 and $4.0, respectively, will either expire or be refunded at various dates through 2036 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.
A valuation allowance of $37.2 and $18.5 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, has been recorded which relates to the U.S. federal and state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and U.S. state tax credits.The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $18.7 in 2016, which was related to foreign net operating loss, U.S. federal net operating loss and state credit carryforwards.The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $3.0 in 2015, which related to foreign net operating loss and U.S. state credit carryforwards.
Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Companys effective income tax rate are analyzed below: Year Ended December31, 2016 2015 2014 U.S. statutory federal tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State and local taxes 0.1 0.1 0.4 Foreign earnings and dividends taxed at different rates (9.7) (8.8) (8.3) Valuation allowance 0.7 0.3 (0.4) Other 0.9  (0.2) Effective tax rate 27.0 % 26.6 % 26.5 % The tax rates for each year presented above reflect the effect of acquisition-related expenses incurred during such years.The effect of acquisition-related expenses had the impact of increasing the Companys effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 by 50 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses incurred during 2014 did not have an impact on the effective tax rate for that year.
The components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following: December31, 2016 2015 Deferred tax assets relating to: Accrued liabilities and reserves $ 36.8 $ 21.4 Operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 58.8 29.4 Pensions, net 64.7 63.6 Inventories 45.3 29.0 Employee benefits 43.4 41.8 Total deferred tax assets 249.0 185.2 Valuation allowance (37.2) (18.5) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 211.8 166.7 Deferred tax liabilities relating to: Goodwill 185.9 163.5 Depreciation and amortization 67.6 37.4 Contingent consideration 6.6 6.6 Total deferred tax liabilities 260.1 207.5 Net deferred tax liability $ 48.3 $ 40.8 Classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as reflected on the balance sheet: Intangibles, net and other long-term assets $ 29.4 $ 26.0 Other long-term liabilities 77.7 66.8 Net deferred tax liability, long-term $ 48.3 $ 40.8 50 Table of Contents A tabular reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at the beginning and end of the year for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is shown below.The gross increases for tax positions in prior periods recorded in 2016 include $78.7 which are related to acquisitions.
2016 2015 2014 Unrecognized tax benefits as of January1 $ 29.8 $ 27.7 $ 24.8 Gross increases for tax positions in prior periods 81.9 0.3 2.2 Gross increases for tax positions in current period 7.0 2.1 2.6 Settlements (10.8)  (0.5) Lapse of statute of limitations (1.7) (0.3) (1.4) Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31 $ 106.2 $ 29.8 $ 27.7 The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the provision for income taxes included a net expense of $6.5, $1.5 and $0.9, respectively, in estimated interest and penalties.As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included $35.3, $6.0 and $4.5, respectively, for tax-related interest and penalties.
The Company operates in the U.S. and numerous foreign taxable jurisdictions, and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2011 and after. The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit.The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by tax authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite the Companys belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate, was approximately $138.7 and $20.6, respectively.Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and the closing of statutes of limitation.Based on information currently available, management anticipates that over the next twelve-month period, audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitation may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $8.6.
Note 5Equity Stock-Based Compensation: The Companys income before income taxes (and net income) were reduced by $47.6 ($36.2 after-tax), $44.2 ($32.9 after-tax) and $41.4 ($30.3 after-tax) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the expense incurred for stock-based compensation plans, which is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the following activity occurred under the Companys option plans: 2016 2015 2014 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 197.2 $ 88.1 $ 136.8 Total fair value of stock options vested 43.1 39.9 37.2 As of December 31, 2016, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $112.8, with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.30 years.
The grant date fair value of each option grant under the 2000 Employee Option Plan, the 2009 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant date fair value of each restricted share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make 52 Table of Contents certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical post-vesting termination experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Companys dividend rate.
Restricted Stock In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan). The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Companys Board of Directors.As of December 31, 2016, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 137,069.Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Companys Common Stock without payment.
Restricted share activity for 2014, 2015 and 2016 was as follows: Weighted Average FairValue Remaining Restricted atGrant Amortization Shares Date Term(inyears) Restricted shares outstanding at January 1, 2014 26,880 $ 38.76 0.39 Restricted shares granted 18,340 47.72 Shares vested and issued (26,880) 38.76 Restricted shares outstanding at December31,2014 18,340 47.72 0.39 Restricted shares granted 17,948 57.85 Shares vested and issued (19,032) 47.98 Restricted shares outstanding at December31,2015 17,256 57.97 0.39 Restricted shares granted 16,905 57.99 Shares vested and issued (17,256) 57.97 Restricted shares outstanding at December31,2016 16,905 57.99 0.38 The total fair value of restricted share awards that vested during 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $1.0, $0.9, and $1.0, respectively.As of December 31, 2016, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $0.4 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.38 years.
Stock Repurchase Program: In January2013, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its Common Stock during the two-year period ending January31, 2015 (the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program).During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased 11.4 million shares of its common stock for $539.4.These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly.At December 31, 2014, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2013 Stock Repurchase Program.

These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly.At December 31, 2016, the Company had repurchased all of the shares authorized under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program.
On January24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Companys Common Stock during the two-year period ending January24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program).As of February 10, 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock 53 Table of Contents for $213.9 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
Dividends: Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.In the third quarter of 2015, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.125 to $0.14 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2015, and in October 2016, approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.14 to $0.16 per share effective with dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2016.Total dividends declared during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $178.8, $163.7 and $140.6, respectively.Total dividends paid in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $172.7, $159.3 and $101.9, respectively, including those declared in the prior year and paid in the current year.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss): Balances of related after-tax components comprising Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in equity at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: Foreign Unrealized Defined Accumulated Currency Gain (Loss) Benefit Other Translation on Cash Plan Comprehensive Adjustments FlowHedges Adjustment Income(Loss) Balance at January1, 2014 $ 67.0 $ (0.1) $ (121.9) $ (55.0) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net of tax of nil, $0.2 and $39.9, respectively (80.4) (1.2) (82.0) (163.6) Amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, net of tax of ($6.2)   12.8 12.8 Balance at December31,2014 (13.4) (1.3) (191.1) (205.8) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net of tax of nil, $0.1 and $5.5, respectively (151.5) (0.4) (10.0) (161.9) Amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, net of tax of ($10.1)   18.2 18.2 Balance at December31,2015 (164.9) (1.7) (182.9) (349.5) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net of tax of nil, ($0.3) and $12.3, respectively (108.6) 1.6 (28.8) (135.8) Amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings, net of tax of ($8.9)   16.3 16.3 Balance at December31,2016 $ (273.5) $ (0.1) $ (195.4) $ (469.0) The amounts reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for defined benefit plan liabilities, are included within Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses and for unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges, are included in Cost of sales within the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income.
54 Table of Contents Note 6Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common shares outstanding, which relates to stock options. A reconciliation of the basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: (dollars and shares in millions, except per share data) 2016 2015 2014 Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation shareholders $ 822.9 $ 763.5 $ 709.1 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 308.3 309.1 313.1 Effect of dilutive stock options 6.9 7.4 7.3 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 315.2 316.5 320.4 Earnings per share attributable to Amphenol Corporation shareholders: Basic $ 2.67 $ 2.47 $ 2.26 Diluted $ 2.61 $ 2.41 $ 2.21 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 8.5 million, 6.3 million and 5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Note7Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits Defined Benefit Plans The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (the U.S. Plans), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory.Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans.Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the International Plans and together with the U.S. Plans, the Plans). The largest international pension plan, in accordance with local regulations, is unfunded and had a projected benefit obligation of approximately $81.7 and $76.2at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Total required contributions to be made during 2017 for the unfunded International Plans are included in Other accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the tables below.
55 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the Companys defined benefit plans funded status as of the most recent actuarial valuations as of December 31 of each year; for each year presented below, projected benefit obligations exceed assets.

56 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the components of net pension expense for the Companys defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: U.S. Plans International Plans Total 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Components of net pension expense : Service cost $ 6.2 $ 6.5 $ 5.1 $ 2.8 $ 2.8 $ 3.1 $ 9.0 $ 9.3 $ 8.2 Interest cost 15.4 17.4 17.3 5.5 5.4 6.8 20.9 22.8 24.1 Expected return on plan assets (26.2) (25.9) (24.8) (3.9) (3.2) (3.7) (30.1) (29.1) (28.5) Amortization of prior service cost 2.4 2.3 2.7    2.4 2.3 2.7 Amortization of actuarial losses 18.6 21.5 13.3 3.4 4.2 2.6 22.0 25.7 15.9 Net pension expense $ 16.4 $ 21.8 $ 13.6 $ 7.8 $ 9.2 $ 8.8 $ 24.2 $ 31.0 $ 22.4 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 4.11 % 3.75 % 4.60 % 2.96 % 2.91 % 4.09 % Expected long-term return on assets 7.75 % 8.00 % 8.00 % 4.29 % 5.47 % 5.99 % Rate of compensation increase 3.00 % 3.00 % 3.00 % 1.61 % 1.45 % 1.48 % The pension expense for the Plans is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January1 of the applicable year, including mortality projections as well as a weighted average discount rate, rate of increase in future compensation levels and an expected long-term rate of return on the respective Plans assets which are detailed in the table above.
The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations.The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. Plans on this basis was 3.93% and 4.11% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. Plans resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $10.7 at December 31, 2016.The weighted average discount rate for the International Plans was 2.28% and 3.14% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The decrease in the discount rate for the International Plans did not have a material impact on the benefit obligation at December 31, 2016. At December31, 2015, the Company elected to further refine its approach for calculating its service and interest costs beginning in 2016 by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the Company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations. The mortality assumptions used by the Company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants.
The Companys investment strategy for the Plans assets is to achieve a rate of return on plan assets equal to or greater than the average for the respective investment classification through prudent allocation and periodic rebalancing between fixed income and equity instruments. The current investment policy includes a strategy to maintain an adequate level of diversification, subject to portfolio risks.The target allocations for the U.S. Plans are generally 60% equity and 40% fixed income.Short-term strategic ranges for investments are established within these long term target percentages.The Company invests in a diversified investment portfolio through various investment managers and evaluates its plan assets for the existence of concentration risks.As of December 31, 2016, there were no significant concentrations of risks in the Companys defined benefit plan assets.The Company does not invest nor instruct investment managers to invest pension assets in Amphenol securities.The Plans may indirectly hold the Companys securities as a result of external investment management in certain commingled funds.Such holdings would not be material relative to the Plans total assets.The Companys International Plans primarily invest in equity and debt securities and insurance contracts, as determined by each Plans Trustees or investment managers.
In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plans, the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as consideration of long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices.The Company also considered its historical twenty-year compounded return of approximately 8.5%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. As described above, the expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plans assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately 60% with equity managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 8.5%) and 40% with fixed income managers (with an expected long-term rate of return of approximately 57 Table of Contents 6.0%). The Company believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate.
The Companys Plan assets, the vast majority of which relate to the U.S. Plans, are reported at fair value and classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.The process requires judgment and may have an effect on the placement of the Plan assets within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The fair values of the Companys pension Plans assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 by asset category are as follows (refer to Note 3 for definitions of Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs): Assets Measured at Net Asset AssetCategory Total Level 1 Level2 Level3 Value (a) December31,2016 Equity securities: U.S. equities  large cap $ 118.8 $ 88.7 $ 30.1 $  $  U.S. equities  small/mid cap and other 25.8  25.8   International equities  growth 46.5 46.5    International equities  other 60.6 7.0 33.9  19.7 Alternative investment funds 12.6    12.6 Fixed income securities: U.S. fixed income securities  short term 6.0    6.0 U.S. fixed income securities  intermediate term 58.4 58.4    U.S. fixed income securities  high yield 22.2  22.2   International fixed income securities  other 43.0  43.0   Insurance contracts 34.0   34.0  Cash and cash equivalents 12.0 12.0    Total $ 439.9 $ 212.6 $ 155.0 $ 34.0 $ 38.3 December31,2015 Equity securities: U.S. equities  large cap $ 108.2 $ 82.3 $ 25.9 $  $  U.S. equities  small/mid cap and other 22.7  22.7   International equities  growth 46.0 46.0    International equities  other 52.3 6.9 45.4   Alternative investment funds 31.5    31.5 Fixed income securities: U.S. fixed income securities  intermediate term 58.7 58.7    U.S. fixed income securities  high yield 18.9  18.9   International fixed income securities  other 37.2  37.2   Cash and cash equivalents 16.7 16.7    Total $ 392.2 $ 210.6 $ 150.1 $  $ 31.5 (a) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-07, certain investments measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient have been removed from the fair value hierarchy but included in the table above in order to permit the reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to total plan assets.
Equity securities consist primarily of publicly traded U.S. and non-U.S. equities.Publicly traded securities are valued at the last trade or closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.Certain equity securities held in commingled funds are valued at unitized net asset value (NAV) based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the funds.Alternative investment funds include investments in hedge funds including fund of fund products.
58 Table of Contents Fixed income securities consist primarily of government securities and corporate bonds.They are valued at the closing price in the active market or at quotes obtained from brokers/dealers or pricing services.Certain fixed income securities held within commingled funds are valued at NAV as determined by the custodian of the funds based on the fair value of the underlying net assets of the funds.
The Level 3 pension plan assets as of December 31, 2016 included in the table above consist primarily of contracts with insurance companies related to certain international plans.The insurance contracts generally include guarantees in accordance with the policy purchased.Our valuation of Level 3 assets is based on insurance company or third-party actuarial valuations, representing an estimation of the surrender or market values of the insurance contract between the Company and the insurance companies.The Company did not have any such Level 3 pension plan assets as of December 31, 2015.The following table sets forth a summary of changes of the fair value of the Level 3 pension plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2016: 2016 Balance on January 1 $  Additions due to acquisition 34.3 Unrealized gains (losses), net 2.7 Purchases, sales and settlements, net (0.9) Foreign currency translation (2.1) Balance on December 31 $ 34.0 The amounts, before tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2016 and 2015 that have not yet been recognized as expense were as follows: U.S.
International Plans Plans Total 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Net loss $ 194.7 $ 195.9 $ 71.0 $ 60.5 $ 265.7 $ 256.4 Net prior service cost 10.5 9.0   10.5 9.0 Net transition asset    (0.1)  (0.1) The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the Plans above that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are expected to be $22.9 and $2.7, respectively.
The Company made cash contributions to the Plans of $26.2, $24.1, and $23.8 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make aggregate cash contributions to the Plans in 2017 of approximately $25.0, the majority of which will be to the U.S. Plans.The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans assets.
Benefit payments related to the Plans above, including those amounts to be paid out of Company assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be as follows: U.S.
International Plans Plans Total 2017 $ 23.9 $ 6.7 $ 30.6 2018 24.9 6.8 31.7 2019 26.0 6.4 32.4 2020 27.1 6.6 33.7 2021 28.1 8.3 36.4 2022-2026 151.9 45.9 197.8 The Company also has an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory limitations on average compensation for purposes of the benefit computation. The obligation related to the SERP is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the tables above.
59 Table of Contents Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains self-insurance programs for that portion of its health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retirees in the U.S. through postretirement benefit (OPEB) programs. The Companys share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees. The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis. Since the Companys obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and since the benefit obligation and the net postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Companys financial condition or results of operations, the Company believes any change in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the Company.Summary information on the Companys OPEB plans as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 2016 2015 Change in benefit obligation : Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 13.2 $ 12.2 Service cost  0.1 Interest cost 0.4 0.4 Benefits paid (0.9) (1.2) Actuarial loss 0.9 1.7 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 13.6 $ 13.2 Amounts recognized on the balance sheet as of December 31: Other accrued expenses $ 1.2 $ 1.1 Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations 12.4 12.1 Unfunded status at end of year $ 13.6 $ 13.2 Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net (3.6) (3.5) Weighted average assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligations: Discount rate 3.65 % 3.71 % The accumulated benefit obligation for the Companys OPEB plans was equal to its projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
2016 2015 2014 Components of net postretirement benefit expense : Service cost $  $ 0.1 $ 0.1 Interest cost 0.4 0.4 0.5 Amortization of actuarial losses 0.7 0.3 0.4 Net postretirement benefit expense $ 1.1 $ 0.8 $ 1.0 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net postretirement benefit expense: Discount rate 3.71 % 3.50 % 4.15 % The health care cost trend rate, which represents the annual rate of covered benefit cost increases assumed for next year, was 8.25% and 8.50% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is expected to gradually decrease to a rate of 4.75% by calendar year 2024.A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would not result in a material impact on either the postretirement benefit obligation or the postretirement benefit expense.
As of December 31, 2016, the amounts before tax for unrecognized net loss, net prior service cost and net transition obligation included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to OPEB plans that have not yet been recognized as expense are $5.7, nil and nil, respectively.As of December 31, 2015, the amounts before tax for unrecognized net loss, net prior service cost and net transition obligation in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to OPEB plans that have not yet been recognized as expense were $5.5, nil and nil, respectively.The estimated amounts before tax for 60 Table of Contents net loss, prior service cost and net transition obligation for the OPEB plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are expected to be $0.7, nil and nil, respectively.
Benefit payments for the OPEB plan, including those amounts to be paid out of Company assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate are expected to be between $1.2 and $1.4 per year for the next ten years.
Defined Contribution Plans The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements.The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation.The Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $5.0, $4.2 and $3.8 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Note8Leases At December 31, 2016, the Company was committed under operating leases for buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment, which expire at various dates.Total rent expense under operating leases for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $50.5, $41.0 and $38.9, respectively.
Minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 2017 $ 42.4 2018 31.7 2019 22.2 2020 12.1 2021 8.4 Beyond 2021 12.4 Total minimum obligation $ 129.2 Note 9Acquisitions On January 8, 2016, the Company acquired all of the share capital of FCI Asia Pte Ltd (FCI) for a purchase price of approximately $1,178.6, net of cash acquired.The acquisition was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that were held outside of the United States.
Headquartered in Singapore, FCI, a global leader in interconnect solutions for the information technology and data communications, industrial, mobile networks, automotive and mobile devices markets, is reported as part of the Companys Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.FCI is a leading supplier of high-speed backplane and mezzanine connectors, power interconnect solutions and a wide variety of board-mounted interconnects.
The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income include the results of FCI for the period from the acquisition date through December31, 2016. Excluding the impact of acquisitions as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $61.3 for the year ended December31, 2016, compared to the prior year, the Companys net sales increased approximately 2% in the year ended December31, 2016, compared to the prior year.
61 Table of Contents Allocation of Purchase Price The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of FCI based upon their estimated fair values.The excess purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, which primarily represents the value of the assembled workforce along with anticipated cost savings and efficiencies associated with the integration of FCI and other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition.The Company has completed its analysis of the fair value of the net assets acquired through the use of independent valuations and managements estimates.The following table summarizes the assessment of the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, net of cash acquired, as of the date of acquisition of January 8, 2016.
Accounts receivable $ 97.1 Inventories 64.2 Other current assets 13.4 Land and depreciable assets 78.8 Goodwill 943.5 Intangible assets 252.0 Other long-term assets 13.2 Assets acquired 1,462.2 Accounts payable 61.6 Other current liabilities 61.3 Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations 14.7 Other long-term liabilities 146.0 Liabilities assumed 283.6 Net assets acquired $ 1,178.6 Of the $252.0 of acquired intangible assets, $133.8 was assigned to indefinite-lived trade names which are not subject to amortization.The remaining $118.2 of finite-lived acquired intangible assets is comprised of $53.2, $57.0 and $8.0 assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and backlog, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The finite-lived acquired intangible assets have a total weighted average useful life of approximately 10 years.The proprietary technology, customer relationships and backlog have a weighted average useful life of 9 years, 12 years and 0.25 years, respectively.
